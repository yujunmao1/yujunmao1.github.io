I am an independent researcher currently interested in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). In particular, I am curious about understanding the capabilities and limitations of machine learning models, such as large language models (LLMs), as well as their cognitive differences from humans, in order to deploy them for various applications in science and engineering. 

I am looking for PhD positions that start in Fall of 2024.
