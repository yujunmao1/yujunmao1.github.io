<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. The rule of sum is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are two or more mutually exclusive events or scenarios.

Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur at the same time; in other words, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. The rule of sum states that if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and another event can occur in \(n\) ways, and the two events cannot occur simultaneously, then there are \(m + n\) ways for either of the events to occur.

Here&#x27;s a simple example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you have a menu with 3 different appetizers and 4 different desserts. If you want to choose either an appetizer or a dessert, but not both, the rule of sum tells you that there are \(3 + 4 = 7\) different choices you can make.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the choices are mutually exclusive. If it were possible to choose both an appetizer and a dessert, then you would need to use a different combinatorial principle, such as the rule of product, to find the total number of combinations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a(n) be the number of possible rearrangements (including the original one) for n seats, and consider the movement of the first child in the row.
2. If the first child does not move, how many rearrangements do we have?
3. If the first child moves, how many rearrangements do we have?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given hints and recursive reasoning.

1. Let \( a(n) \) be the number of possible rearrangements (including the original one) for \( n \) seats.

2. If the first child does not move, then we have \( n - 1 \) seats left to consider, and the number of rearrangements for these seats is \( a(n - 1) \).

3. If the first child moves, they can only move to the seat immediately to their right. This forces the child who was originally in the second seat to move to the first seat (since each child can move by at most one seat). Now, we effectively have \( n - 2 \) seats left to consider (since the first two seats are now determined), and the number of rearrangements for these seats is \( a(n - 2) \).

Combining these two cases, we get the following recursive formula for \( a(n) \):
\[ a(n) = a(n - 1) + a(n - 2) \]

We also know the base cases:
- For \( n = 1 \), there is only one arrangement (the original one), so \( a(1) = 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), there are two arrangements: either both children stay in their original seats, or they swap seats. So \( a(2) = 2 \).

Now we can compute \( a(n) \) for \( n = 11 \) using the recursive formula:

\( a(3) = a(2) + a(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
\( a(4) = a(3) + a(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
\( a(5) = a(4) + a(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
\( a(6) = a(5) + a(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
\( a(7) = a(6) + a(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
\( a(8) = a(7) + a(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
\( a(9) = a(8) + a(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \)
\( a(10) = a(9) + a(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 \)
\( a(11) = a(10) + a(9) = 89 + 55 = 144 \)

Therefore, there are \( a(11) = 144 \) possible rearrangements (including the original one) for 11 seats when each child may move by at most one seat.</code></pre>
