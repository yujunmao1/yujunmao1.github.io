Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

Suppose you want to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear. There are 5 different shirts to choose from, 3 different pants to choose from, and 2 different shoes to choose from. No two items can be worn at the same time, so you can&#x27;t wear a shirt and pants at the same time, or a shirt and shoes at the same time. So, there are $5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to choose a car, a house, and a pet. There are 10 different cars to choose from, 5 different houses to choose from, and 3 different pets to choose from. No two items can be owned at the same time, so you can&#x27;t own a car and a house at the same time, or a car and a pet at the same time. So, there are $10 \times 5 \times 3 = 150$ ways to choose a car, a house, and a pet.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 4 horses, and each horse can finish in any of the 4 places. So, there are $4^4 = 256$ ways for the horses to finish. However, some of these ways will result in ties. For example, if all 4 horses finish in a tie, then there are 4 ways for this to happen. So, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of ways for the horses to tie.

The number of ways for the horses to tie is the number of permutations of 4 objects with 2 identical objects. This is equal to $\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$.

So, the number of ways for 4 horses to go through the finish (with possibility of ties) is $256 \div 12 = 21$.

Here is another way to think about the problem. Imagine that we have 4 horses, and we line them up in a row. There are 4! ways to line them up. However, some of these ways will result in ties. For example, if we line up the horses in alphabetical order, then there are 4 ways to do this. So, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of ways for the horses to tie.

The number of ways for the horses to tie is the number of permutations of 4 objects with 2 identical objects. This is equal to $\frac{4!}{2!} = 12$.

So, the number of ways for 4 horses to go through the finish (with possibility of ties) is $4! \div 12 = 21$.</code></pre>
