You may find the following information useful:

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of the expression |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. Let&#x27;s go through the steps provided:

1. **Study if the expression can be 0.**
   The expression |12^m - 5^n| can only be 0 if 12^m = 5^n. Since 12 and 5 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions to this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. **Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.**
   Since 5 and 12 are coprime, their powers will also be coprime. This means that the difference between any power of 12 and any power of 5 cannot be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 because the difference would have to share a common factor with either 5 or 12, which is not possible.

3. **For integer a, b and odd n, a + b | a^n + b^n.**
   This property tells us that for odd n, 5 + 12 = 17 will divide 12^n + 5^n. However, this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

4. **Determine if 12^m - 5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.**
   If 12^m - 5^n = 1, then 5^n = 12^m - 1. Using the property from point 5, we can express 5^n - 1 as a product of factors. However, since we are looking for 12^m - 5^n = 1, this does not directly apply.

5. **a^n - 1 = (a - 1)(a^(n-1) + a^(n-2) + ... + a + 1).**
   This factorization is useful for finding factors of 5^n - 1, but we are looking for 12^m - 5^n, so this does not directly apply.

6. **To determine if 5^n - 12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.**
   If 5^n - 12^m = 1, then modulo 3, we have (-1)^n - 0 = 1 mod 3. This means n must be even because (-1)^n = 1 mod 3 only when n is even.

7. **If a | c, b | c and gcd(a, b) = 1, then ab | c.**
   This property of divisibility does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

8. **For even n, factor 5^n - 1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.**
   Since we are looking for 12^m - 5^n, this does not directly apply.

9. **Recognize 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1.**
   This is useful for finding factors of 12^m, but we are looking for 12^m - 5^n, so this does not directly apply.

10. **Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.**
    This step is related to factorization and divisibility, which does not directly apply to finding the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

11. **Study possible solutions of the factor splitting.**
    This step is also related to factorization and does not directly apply to our problem.

Given the above points, we need to find a different approach to solve the problem. Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 5 and 12 modulo some small numbers to see if we can find a pattern that might give us a small difference.

We can start by checking the powers of 5 and 12 modulo 10, as this will give us the last digit of each number, which might help us find a small difference.

5^1 = 5 (mod 10)
5^2 = 25 = 5 (mod 10)
5^3 = 125 = 5 (mod 10)
...
5^n will always end in 5 for any positive integer n.

12^1 = 2 (mod 10)
12^2 = 144 = 4 (mod 10)
12^3 = 1728 = 8 (mod 10)
12^4 = 20736 = 6 (mod 10)
12^5 = 248832 = 2 (mod 10)
...
We can see that the last digit of 12^m cycles through 2, 4, 8, 6, and then back to 2.

Since 5^n always ends in 5, we need to find a power of 12 that ends in either 4 or 6 to get a difference of 1 when subtracted from 5^n. From the cycle of the last digit of 12^m, we can see that 12^2 ends in 4 and 12^4 ends in 6.

Let&#x27;s check these two cases:

Case 1: 12^2 = 144 and 5^1 = 5
|12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139

Case 2: 12^4 = 20736 and 5^3 = 125
|12^4 - 5^3| = |20736 - 125| = 20611

Neither of these cases gives us a difference of 1. However, we can continue this process to find the smallest difference. We can also check for differences of 2, 3, 4, etc., by looking for powers of 12 that end in 3, 7, 8, and so on, respectively.

Let&#x27;s check for a difference of 2:

We need a power of 12 that ends in 3 or 7. Since the cycle of the last digit of 12^m does not contain 3 or 7, we cannot find a difference of 2.

Let&#x27;s check for a difference of 3:

We need a power of 12 that ends in 2 or 8. We know that 12^1 ends in 2 and 12^3 ends in 8.

Case 3: 12^1 = 12 and 5^1 = 5
|12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7

Case 4: 12^3 = 1728 and 5^2 = 25
|12^3 - 5^2| = |1728 - 25| = 1703

Neither of these cases gives us a difference of 3.

Let&#x27;s check for a difference of 4:

We need a power of 12 that ends in 1 or 9. Since the cycle of the last digit of 12^m does not contain 1 or 9, we cannot find a difference of 4.

Let&#x27;s check for a difference of 5:

We need a power of 12 that ends in 0. Since the cycle of the last digit of 12^m does not contain 0, we cannot find a difference of 5.

Let&#x27;s check for a difference of 6:

We need a power of 12 that ends in 1 or 9. Since the cycle of the last digit of 12^m does not contain 1 or 9, we cannot find a difference of 6.

Since we have not found a small difference yet, we need to continue this process or find a different approach. One approach could be to compute the powers of 5 and 12 and look for close values. However, this could be computationally intensive.

Another approach is to consider the problem modulo a higher power of 10, such as 100, to get more information about the second-to-last digit of the powers of 5 and 12. This could help us find a pair of powers that are close to each other.

Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 5 and 12 modulo 100:

5^1 = 05 (mod 100)
5^2 = 25 (mod 100)
5^3 = 125 = 25 (mod 100)
5^4 = 625 = 25 (mod 100)
...
5^n will always end in 25 for any n &gt; 1.

12^1 = 12 (mod 100)
12^2 = 144 (mod 100)
12^3 = 1728 = 28 (mod 100)
12^4 = 20736 = 36 (mod 100)
12^5 = 248832 = 32 (mod 100)
12^6 = 2985984 = 84 (mod 100)
12^7 = 35831808 = 08 (mod 100)
...
The second-to-last digit of 12^m cycles in a more complex pattern, but we can see that 12^6 ends in 84, which is close to 85 (the last two digits of 5^n for n &gt; 1).

Let&#x27;s check this case:

Case 5: 12^6 = 2985984 and 5^3 = 125
|12^6 - 5^3| = |2985984 - 125| = 2985859

This is still not a small difference. We need to find a power of 12 that ends in a number close to 25 modulo 100.

By continuing this process, we may eventually find a pair of powers that are close to each other, but this method is not guaranteed to be efficient. It may be necessary to use more advanced number theory techniques to find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n.

Given the complexity of the problem and the limitations of the approaches we&#x27;ve tried so far, it may be best to consider using computational methods to search for the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|. A computer program could quickly compute powers of 5 and 12 and compare their differences to find the smallest one. However, without such computational assistance, finding the smallest value analytically is a challenging task that may require deeper insights into the properties of powers and modular arithmetic.</code></pre>
