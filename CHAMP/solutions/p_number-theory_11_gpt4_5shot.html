Find all integer values of m such that 1000^m-1 is a factor of 1978^m-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have 1978^m-1000^m=(2*989)^m-(2*500)^m=2^m*(989^m-500^m).
2. Since 1000^m-1 is an odd number, gcd(2^m, 1000^m-1)=1.
3. Thus, if 1000^m-1 | 1978^m-1000^m, we must have 1000^m-1 | 989^m-500^m.
4. But the divisibility cannot be true since 989^m-500^m&lt;1000^m-1.
5. So 1000^m-1 ∤ 1978^m-1000^m.
6. Since 1978^m-1000^m=(1978^m-1)-(1000^m-1), we have 1000^m-1 ∤ 1978^m-1.
7. Thus, there is no such integer m.</code></pre>

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 11 rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We let a_n be the number of ways to tile a 2 x n rectangle.
2. For a 2 x (n+1) rectangle, let 2 be the vertical dimension and n+1 be the horizontal direction.
3. Thus, it could have one vertical tile in the last column, or two horizontal tiles in the last two columns.
4. Without these new tiles, we have 2 x n or 2 x (n-1) rectangles.
5. Thus, we have a_(n+1)=a_n+a_(n-1).
6. Starting from a_1=1 and a_2=2, we have the sequence of number of ways as 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, with a_11=144.
7. Thus, there are 144 ways to tile a 2 x 11 rectangle.</code></pre>

The sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, ... is such that, for all nonnegative m≥n, we have a_(m+n)+a_(m−n)=(a_(2m)+a_(2n))/2. If a_1=1, find a_50.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. With m=n, we have a_(2n)+a_0=(a_(2n)+a_(2n))/2.
2. So a_0=0.
3. With n=0, we have a_m+a_m=(a_(2m)+a_0)/2.
4. So a_(2m)=4a_m.
5. With m=n+2, we have a_(2n+2)+a_2=(a_(2n+4)+a_(2n))/2.
6. Plugging in a_(2m)=4a_m, we have 4(a_(n+1)+a_1)=4*(a_(n+2)+a_n)/2.
7. With a_1=1, we have a_(n+2)=2a_(n+1)-a_n+2.
8. Thus, starting from a_0=0, a_1=1, we have the sequence a_0, a_1, a_2, ... to be 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...
9. We see that a_n=n^2, which can be shown with a_(n+2)^2=n^2+4n+4=2(n^2+2n+1)-n^2+2=a_(n+1)^2-a_n^2+2.
10. Thus, a_50=2500.</code></pre>

For real number a, b, what is the largest value of |a+b|/(1+|a+b|)-|a|/(1+|a|)-|b|/(1+|b|)?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let x=|a|, y=|b|, z=|a+b|, so the expression is z/(1+z)-x/(1+x)-y/(1+y).
2. Multiply the expression by (1+x)(1+y)(1+z), we get z(1+x)(1+y)-x(1+y)(1+z)-y(1+x)(1+z)=z+xz+yz+xyz-x-xy-xz-xyz-y-xy-yz-xyz=z-x-y-2xy-xyz.
3. We have |a+b|≤|a|+|b|, so z-x-y≤0.
4. With all other terms being non-negative, we can see that this expression is non-positive.
5. Thus, the largest value of it is 0, achieved when, for example, a=b=0.</code></pre>

For x, y, z&gt;0, what is the smallest value of x^2/y^2+y^2/z^2+z^2/x^2-(y/x+z/y+x/z)?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^2/y^2+y^2/z^2+z^2/x^2=(x/y)(x/y)+(y/z)(y/z)+(z/x)(z/x), and y/x+z/y+x/z=(y/z)(z/x)+(z/x)(x/y)+(x/y)(y/z).
2. Thus, the former is the sum of products of elements between the sequences (x/y, y/z, x/z) and (x/y, y/z, x/z), which are similarly sorted.
3. By contrast, the latter is the sum of the products of elements between the same two sequences but permuted differently.
4. So we have x^2/y^2+y^2/z^2+z^2/x^2≥y/x+z/y+x/z, with equality achieved when a=b=c.
5. Thus, the smallest value is 0.</code></pre>

Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let the number be in the form of 10n + d, where n is the number formed by the digits after the first digit and d is the first digit.
2. The number becomes 57 times smaller when the first digit is removed, so we have 10n + d = 57n.
3. Simplifying, we get d = 47n.
4. Since d is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9. The smallest n that makes d a single digit is n = 1.
5. So, d = 47 * 1 = 47, which is not a single digit.
