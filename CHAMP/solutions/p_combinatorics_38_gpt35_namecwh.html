<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.

In simple terms, the rule of sum states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m + n ways to do either one of those things.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt or one pair of pants, you can use the rule of sum.

According to the rule of sum, you add the number of choices for each mutually exclusive event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 + 2 = 5.

To generalize the rule of sum, if you have k mutually exclusive events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the sum of all the options: m1 + m2 + m3 + ... + mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum assumes that the events or choices are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only choose one option from each event. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of product or inclusion-exclusion principle may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of sum is a fundamental principle in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula, also known as the binomial coefficient formula, is a mathematical formula used to calculate the number of combinations or subsets that can be formed from a set of objects.

The combination formula is denoted as &quot;n choose r&quot; and is represented as C(n, r) or sometimes as nCr. It is defined as:

C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)

Where:
- n is the total number of objects in the set.
- r is the number of objects chosen or selected from the set.
- n! represents the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n.

The combination formula calculates the number of ways to choose r objects from a set of n objects without regard to the order in which they are chosen. In other words, it counts the number of subsets of size r that can be formed from a set of size n.

For example, let&#x27;s say you have a set of 5 different books and you want to determine the number of ways to choose 3 books to read. Using the combination formula, you can calculate it as:

C(5, 3) = 5! / (3! * (5 - 3)!)
         = 5! / (3! * 2!)
         = (5 * 4 * 3!) / (3! * 2 * 1)
         = (5 * 4) / (2 * 1)
         = 10

Therefore, there are 10 different combinations or subsets of 3 books that can be formed from a set of 5 books.

The combination formula is widely used in various areas of mathematics, statistics, and combinatorics to calculate the number of combinations or subsets in different scenarios, such as selecting a committee from a group of people, forming teams, or solving problems involving combinations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. In how many ways can two boys and one girl be selected?
2. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
3. In how many ways can three boys be selected?
4. In how many ways can the three toys be given to the selected children?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can break it down into smaller steps and use the concepts mentioned.

Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select two boys and one girl.
Using the combination formula, we can calculate this as:
C(4, 2) * C(6, 1) = (4! / (2! * (4-2)!)) * (6! / (1! * (6-1)!))
= (4 * 3 / (2 * 1)) * (6 / 1)
= 6 * 6
= 36

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to select three boys.
Using the combination formula, we can calculate this as:
C(4, 3) = 4! / (3! * (4-3)!)
= 4! / (3! * 1!)
= 4 / 1
= 4

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways to give the three toys to the selected children.
Since each child receives one toy, there are 3! (3 factorial) ways to distribute the toys among the selected children.
3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6

Step 4: Calculate the total number of ways to satisfy the given conditions.
To ensure that at least two boys are selected, we need to consider two cases:
1. Selecting two boys and one girl: 36 ways (from Step 1)
2. Selecting three boys: 4 ways (from Step 2)

Now, we need to calculate the total number of ways to distribute the toys among the selected children in each case:
1. For the case of selecting two boys and one girl, there are 6 ways to distribute the toys (from Step 3).
2. For the case of selecting three boys, there is only 1 way to distribute the toys (since all toys go to boys).

Finally, we add the number of ways from both cases to get the total number of ways to satisfy the given conditions:
36 * 6 + 4 * 1 = 216 + 4 = 220

Therefore, there are 220 ways to distribute the toys among the children, ensuring that at least two boys are selected.</code></pre>
