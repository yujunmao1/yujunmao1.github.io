<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?
Step-wise solution:
1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.
2. We can paint it on top, the remaining four faces have 4! colorings, but we can rotate the cube four times, which makes four colorings the same, so we 4!/4=6 distinct colorings.
3. If the second face is on the side, we can put it on the front, and the two faces uniquely fix the rotation.
4. Thus, any coloring of the remaining four faces is distinct, and we have 4!=24 colorings.
5. In total, we have 30 colorings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to count the number of strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, and 3, with the restriction that no two 1s are adjacent.

Let&#x27;s break this down into cases based on the number of 1s in the string.

Case 1: No 1s in the string
If there are no 1s, then each of the 5 positions can be either a 2 or a 3. This gives us 2^5 possibilities.

Case 2: One 1 in the string
If there is one 1, it can be placed in any of the 5 positions, and the remaining 4 positions can be either a 2 or a 3. This gives us 5 * 2^4 possibilities.

Case 3: Two 1s in the string
If there are two 1s, they cannot be adjacent. We can think of the 1s as &quot;dividers&quot; splitting the string into three parts (which could be empty): before the first 1, between the two 1s, and after the second 1. There are 4 positions where the &quot;dividers&quot; can be placed (between the 5 digits), and we need to choose 2 of them. This can be done in C(4, 2) ways. For each such division, the remaining positions (3 in total) can be either a 2 or a 3, giving us C(4, 2) * 2^3 possibilities.

Case 4: Three 1s in the string
If there are three 1s, they must be separated by at least one other digit. There are only two positions for the non-1 digits, and they can be either a 2 or a 3. This gives us 2^2 possibilities.

Case 5: Four or more 1s in the string
This case is not possible because we cannot place four or more 1s in the string without having two of them adjacent.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the total number of strings for each case:

Case 1: 2^5 = 32
Case 2: 5 * 2^4 = 5 * 16 = 80
Case 3: C(4, 2) * 2^3 = 6 * 8 = 48
Case 4: 2^2 = 4

Adding these up, we get the total number of strings:

Total = Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3 + Case 4
Total = 32 + 80 + 48 + 4
Total = 164

Therefore, there are 164 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.</code></pre>
