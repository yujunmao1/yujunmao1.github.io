Find all integer solutions to the equation x^2-3y^2=17.

You may find the following information useful:

1. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.
2. If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the Diophantine equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \), we can use the method of descent, which involves finding a solution and then using that solution to find others.

First, let&#x27;s look for any obvious solutions. We can try small values of \( y \) and see if \( x^2 \) comes out to be a perfect square.

For \( y = 0 \), \( x^2 = 17 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 1 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 = 20 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 2 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 4 = 29 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 3 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 9 = 44 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 4 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 16 = 65 \), which is not a perfect square.

However, for \( y = 5 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 25 = 92 \), which is not a perfect square either.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s not very efficient. Instead, let&#x27;s try to use the properties given to us.

We know that \( x^2 = 3y^2 + 17 \). If \( x \) is even, then \( x^2 \) is divisible by 4, and since 17 is not divisible by 4, \( 3y^2 \) must be odd, which is impossible because 3 is odd and \( y^2 \) is always even if \( y \) is even. Therefore, \( x \) must be odd.

Let&#x27;s assume \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime. If they were not, then \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) would have a common factor, and so would \( x^2 - 3y^2 \), but 17 is prime, so \( x \) and \( y \) must be coprime.

Now, let&#x27;s factor the left side over the integers:

\( (x - \sqrt{3}y)(x + \sqrt{3}y) = 17 \).

Since \( x \) and \( y \) are integers, \( x - \sqrt{3}y \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y \) are not integers, but they are conjugates in the field \( \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{3}] \). The norm of an element \( a + b\sqrt{3} \) in this field is \( a^2 - 3b^2 \), which is multiplicative. Therefore, the norm of \( x - \sqrt{3}y \) times the norm of \( x + \sqrt{3}y \) is \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \).

Since 17 is prime in the integers, it is also prime in \( \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{3}] \) because it cannot be written as the norm of any element in \( \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{3}] \) other than \( \pm 1 \) and \( \pm 17 \). Therefore, \( x - \sqrt{3}y \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y \) must be units times a power of 17.

The units in \( \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{3}] \) are of the form \( \pm(2 + \sqrt{3})^n \), where \( n \) is an integer. However, since \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime, the only units that can appear are \( \pm 1 \).

Thus, we have \( x - \sqrt{3}y = \pm 1 \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y = \pm 17 \) or vice versa. Solving these equations, we get:

1. \( x - \sqrt{3}y = 1 \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y = 17 \) gives us \( 2x = 18 \) and \( 2\sqrt{3}y = 16 \), so \( x = 9 \) and \( y = \frac{16}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3} \), which is not an integer, so this is not a solution.

2. \( x - \sqrt{3}y = -1 \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y = -17 \) gives us \( 2x = -18 \) and \( 2\sqrt{3}y = -16 \), so \( x = -9 \) and \( y = \frac{-16}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-8\sqrt{3}}{3} \), which is not an integer, so this is not a solution.

3. \( x - \sqrt{3}y = 17 \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y = 1 \) gives us \( 2x = 18 \) and \( 2\sqrt{3}y = -16 \), so \( x = 9 \) and \( y = \frac{-16}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{-8\sqrt{3}}{3} \), which is not an integer, so this is not a solution.

4. \( x - \sqrt{3}y = -17 \) and \( x + \sqrt{3}y = -1 \) gives us \( 2x = -18 \) and \( 2\sqrt{3}y = 16 \), so \( x = -9 \) and \( y = \frac{16}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{3} \), which is not an integer, so this is not a solution.

It seems that we have made a mistake in our reasoning, as we have not found any integer solutions. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate our approach.

We know that \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \) and \( x \) and \( y \) must be coprime. We also know that \( x \) must be odd. Let&#x27;s try to find a solution by considering the equation modulo 3:

\( x^2 \equiv 17 \mod 3 \)
\( x^2 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \)

However, the quadratic residues modulo 3 are 0 and 1 (since \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \), \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \), and \( 2^2 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \)). Therefore, there is no integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \mod 3 \). This means that our initial assumption that \( x \) and \( y \) are coprime is incorrect.

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \), we can rewrite this as \( x^2 = 3y^2 + 17 \). If \( x \) is even, then \( x^2 \) is divisible by 4, and since 17 is not divisible by 4, \( 3y^2 \) must be odd, which is impossible because 3 is odd and \( y^2 \) is always even if \( y \) is even. Therefore, \( x \) must be odd.

Let&#x27;s try to find a solution by considering the equation modulo 4:

\( x^2 \equiv 17 \mod 4 \)
\( x^2 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)

This is possible since the quadratic residues modulo 4 are 0 and 1 (since \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( 2^2 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), and \( 3^2 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)). Therefore, \( x \) must be congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.

Now, let&#x27;s try to find a solution by trial and error, using the fact that \( x \) must be odd and congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4:

For \( y = 1 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 = 20 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 2 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 4 = 29 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 3 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 9 = 44 \), which is not a perfect square.
For \( y = 4 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 16 = 65 \), which is not a perfect square.

However, for \( y = 5 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 25 = 92 \), which is not a perfect square either.

Let&#x27;s try \( y = 6 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 36 = 125 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 7 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 49 = 164 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 8 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 64 = 209 \), which is not a perfect square.

However, for \( y = 9 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 81 = 260 \), which is not a perfect square either.

Let&#x27;s try \( y = 10 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 100 = 317 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 11 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 121 = 380 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 12 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 144 = 449 \), which is a perfect square since \( 449 = 21^2 \). Therefore, we have found a solution: \( x = 21 \), \( y = 12 \).

Now, let&#x27;s check if there are any other solutions. We can use the fact that \( x \) and \( y \) must be coprime and \( x \) must be odd. We can also use the fact that \( x \) must be congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.

Let&#x27;s try \( y = 13 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 169 = 524 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 14 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 196 = 605 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 15 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 225 = 692 \), which is not a perfect square.

However, for \( y = 16 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 256 = 785 \), which is not a perfect square either.

Let&#x27;s try \( y = 17 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 289 = 884 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 18 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 324 = 989 \), which is not a perfect square.

For \( y = 19 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 361 = 1100 \), which is not a perfect square.

However, for \( y = 20 \), \( x^2 = 17 + 3 \cdot 400 = 1217 \), which is not a perfect square either.

It seems that we are not finding any other solutions by trial and error. Let&#x27;s try to find a pattern or a more systematic way to find solutions.

We know that \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \) and \( x \) must be odd. We also know that \( x \) must be congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4. Let&#x27;s try to find a solution by considering the equation modulo 8:

\( x^2 \equiv 17 \mod 8 \)
\( x^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \)

This is possible since the quadratic residues modulo 8 are 0, 1, and 4 (since \( 0^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), \( 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), \( 2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 8 \), \( 3^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), \( 4^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), \( 5^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \), \( 6^2 \equiv 4 \mod 8 \), and \( 7^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \)). Therefore, \( x \) must be congruent to 1, 3, 5, or 7 modulo 8.

Now, let&#x27;s try to find a solution by considering the equation modulo 16:

\( x^2 \equiv 17 \mod 16 \)
\( x^2 \equiv 1 \mod 16 \)

This is possible since the quadratic residues modulo 16 are </code></pre>
