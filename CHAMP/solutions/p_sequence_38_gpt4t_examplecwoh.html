<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For integer a, b with a&gt;b, gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, a-b). </code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is based on the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the gcd of two numbers also divides their difference.

Let&#x27;s take two positive integers where \( a = 21 \) and \( b = 15 \), and we know that \( a &gt; b \).

According to the concept:

\[ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b) \]

So we compute:

\[ \gcd(21, 15) = \gcd(15, 21 - 15) \]
\[ \gcd(21, 15) = \gcd(15, 6) \]

Now, we can continue to apply the concept iteratively:

\[ \gcd(15, 6) = \gcd(6, 15 - 6) \]
\[ \gcd(15, 6) = \gcd(6, 9) \]

And again:

\[ \gcd(6, 9) = \gcd(9, 6) \]  (since gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a))
\[ \gcd(9, 6) = \gcd(6, 9 - 6) \]
\[ \gcd(9, 6) = \gcd(6, 3) \]

Finally:

\[ \gcd(6, 3) = \gcd(3, 6 - 3) \]
\[ \gcd(6, 3) = \gcd(3, 3) \]

At this point, we see that both numbers are the same, which means we&#x27;ve found the gcd:

\[ \gcd(3, 3) = 3 \]

So, the greatest common divisor of 21 and 15 is 3, which we&#x27;ve found by repeatedly applying the concept \( \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a - b) \) until we reached a pair of numbers where one divides the other.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is related to the property of coprime integers. Two integers \( a \) and \( b \) are said to be coprime (or relatively prime) if their greatest common divisor is 1, that is, \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \). This implies that \( a \) and \( b \) share no prime factors.

Now, if \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime and \( a \neq 1 \), then for any positive integer \( n \), \( a \) will also be coprime with \( b^n \). This is because raising \( b \) to the power of \( n \) simply multiplies the prime factors of \( b \) by themselves \( n \) times, and since \( a \) shares no prime factors with \( b \), it will share no prime factors with \( b^n \) either.

Let&#x27;s take an example with specific numbers:

Let \( a = 7 \) and \( b = 10 \). We can see that \( \gcd(7, 10) = 1 \) because 7 is a prime number and does not divide 10, which means they are coprime.

Now, let&#x27;s consider \( b^n \) for \( n = 3 \), so we have \( b^n = 10^3 = 1000 \).

We want to show that \( \gcd(a, b^n) = \gcd(7, 1000) = 1 \).

Since 7 is a prime number and does not divide 10, it also does not divide any power of 10, including 1000. Therefore, 7 and 1000 are coprime, and their gcd is 1.

Thus, \( \gcd(7, 1000) = 1 \), which confirms the concept that if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \) and \( a \neq 1 \), then \( \gcd(a, b^n) = 1 \) for any \( n \).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The terms of the sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... are all positive, and a_(n+1)=sqrt(1+a_n) for all n. Does there exist such a sequence with all a_n being rational numbers, and if so, find the smallest possible value of a_1 such that the sequence satisfies the condition.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if there exists a sequence \( \{a_n\} \) with all terms being rational numbers and satisfying the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we need to investigate the properties of the sequence and the conditions under which the terms can be rational.

Let&#x27;s start by assuming that there exists a rational number \( a_1 \) that begins such a sequence. We want to find the smallest possible value of \( a_1 \) that satisfies the condition.

Given the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we can square both sides to obtain:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + a_n \]

Now, let&#x27;s rearrange the terms:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 - a_n = 1 \]

This equation suggests that \( a_{n+1}^2 - a_n \) is an integer, which implies that \( a_n \) and \( a_{n+1}^2 \) must have the same fractional part if \( a_n \) is rational. Since \( a_{n+1} \) is the square root of a rational number, it will be rational if and only if the number inside the square root is a perfect square.

Let&#x27;s consider the smallest possible rational value for \( a_1 \). If \( a_1 \) is rational and not an integer, then \( a_2 \) would be the square root of a non-integer rational number, which cannot be rational unless the number inside the square root is a perfect square. However, if \( a_1 \) is an integer, then \( a_2 \) is the square root of an integer plus one, which is rational only if \( a_1 \) is one less than a perfect square.

To find the smallest such \( a_1 \), we can start with the smallest perfect square greater than 1, which is 4 (since the square root of 1 is 1, and we want \( a_1 \neq 1 \)). The integer one less than 4 is 3. Let&#x27;s check if starting with \( a_1 = 3 \) works:

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]

Since \( a_2 \) is rational, we can continue:

\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 2} = \sqrt{3} \]

However, \( \sqrt{3} \) is not a rational number, so \( a_1 = 3 \) does not lead to a sequence where all terms are rational.

The next integer to try is one less than the next perfect square, which is 8 (since \( 3^2 = 9 \)):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 8} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

And we can continue:

\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
\[ a_4 = \sqrt{1 + a_3} = \sqrt{1 + 2} = \sqrt{3} \]

Again, we encounter \( \sqrt{3} \), which is not rational. Therefore, \( a_1 = 8 \) also does not work.

Continuing this process, we look for the next smallest integer that is one less than a perfect square. The next perfect square after 9 is 16, so we try \( a_1 = 15 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 15} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]

Since \( \sqrt{5} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 15 \) does not work either.

The next perfect square is 25, so we try \( a_1 = 24 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 24} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 5} = \sqrt{6} \]

Again, \( \sqrt{6} \) is not rational, so \( a_1 = 24 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 36, so we try \( a_1 = 35 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 35} = \sqrt{36} = 6 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 6} = \sqrt{7} \]

Since \( \sqrt{7} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 35 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 49, so we try \( a_1 = 48 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 48} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 7} = \sqrt{8} \]

Since \( \sqrt{8} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 48 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 64, so we try \( a_1 = 63 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 63} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 8} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]
\[ a_4 = \sqrt{1 + a_3} = \sqrt{1 + 3} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
\[ a_5 = \sqrt{1 + a_4} = \sqrt{1 + 2} = \sqrt{3} \]

We have encountered \( \sqrt{3} \) again, which is not rational, so \( a_1 = 63 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 81, so we try \( a_1 = 80 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 80} = \sqrt{81} = 9 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} \]

Since \( \sqrt{10} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 80 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 100, so we try \( a_1 = 99 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 99} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 10} = \sqrt{11} \]

Since \( \sqrt{11} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 99 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 121, so we try \( a_1 = 120 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 120} = \sqrt{121} = 11 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 11} = \sqrt{12} \]

Since \( \sqrt{12} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 120 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 144, so we try \( a_1 = 143 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 143} = \sqrt{144} = 12 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 12} = \sqrt{13} \]

Since \( \sqrt{13} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 143 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 169, so we try \( a_1 = 168 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 168} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 13} = \sqrt{14} \]

Since \( \sqrt{14} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 168 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 196, so we try \( a_1 = 195 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 195} = \sqrt{196} = 14 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 14} = \sqrt{15} \]

Since \( \sqrt{15} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 195 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 225, so we try \( a_1 = 224 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 224} = \sqrt{225} = 15 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 15} = \sqrt{16} = 4 \]
\[ a_4 = \sqrt{1 + a_3} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]

Since \( \sqrt{5} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 224 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 256, so we try \( a_1 = 255 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 255} = \sqrt{256} = 16 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17} \]

Since \( \sqrt{17} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 255 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 289, so we try \( a_1 = 288 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 288} = \sqrt{289} = 17 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 17} = \sqrt{18} \]

Since \( \sqrt{18} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 288 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 324, so we try \( a_1 = 323 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 323} = \sqrt{324} = 18 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 18} = \sqrt{19} \]

Since \( \sqrt{19} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 323 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 361, so we try \( a_1 = 360 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 360} = \sqrt{361} = 19 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 19} = \sqrt{20} \]

Since \( \sqrt{20} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 360 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 400, so we try \( a_1 = 399 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 399} = \sqrt{400} = 20 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 20} = \sqrt{21} \]

Since \( \sqrt{21} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 399 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 441, so we try \( a_1 = 440 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 440} = \sqrt{441} = 21 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 21} = \sqrt{22} \]

Since \( \sqrt{22} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 440 \) does not work.

The next perfect square is 484, so we try \( a_1 = 483 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 483} = \sqrt{484} = 22 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{1 + 22} = \sqrt{23} \]

Since \( \sqrt{23} \) is not rational, \( a_1 = 483 \) does not work</code></pre>
