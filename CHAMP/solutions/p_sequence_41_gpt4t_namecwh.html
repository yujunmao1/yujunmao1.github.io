<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) is a fundamental result in real analysis, particularly in the context of measure theory and integration. It provides conditions under which the limit of a sequence of functions can be integrated by integrating the functions in the sequence. The theorem applies to sequences of real-valued measurable functions that are monotone—that is, either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Here is the statement of the Monotone Convergence Theorem for non-decreasing sequences of functions:

Let \((f_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions defined on a measure space \((X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)\), such that \(f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)\) for all \(x \in X\) and all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). If \(f_n(x) \to f(x)\) pointwise as \(n \to \infty\) for almost every \(x \in X\), where \(f\) is also a measurable function, then
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
\]

In other words, if you have a sequence of non-negative functions that increase pointwise to some limit function \(f\), then the integral of the limit function \(f\) is the limit of the integrals of the functions in the sequence.

The Monotone Convergence Theorem is particularly useful because it allows us to interchange the limit and the integral, which is not always possible in more general settings. This theorem is a key tool in proving other important results in analysis, such as the Dominated Convergence Theorem and the Fatou&#x27;s Lemma.

It&#x27;s important to note that the Monotone Convergence Theorem requires the functions to be non-negative. This condition ensures that the integrals of the functions in the sequence are well-defined (possibly infinite) and that the sequence of integrals is non-decreasing, which is crucial for the conclusion of the theorem to hold.

The theorem can also be stated for non-increasing sequences of functions, with the appropriate adjustments. In this case, the functions would converge to a non-negative limit function from above, and the theorem would guarantee that the limit of the integrals is equal to the integral of the limit function.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a&gt;0, does the limit of the sequence defined by a_0=sqrt(a), a_(n+1)=sqrt(a+a_n) exist, and if so, find it as an expression of a.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.
2. A polynomial of degree n with root x_1, ..., x_n can be written as a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_n) for some value of a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether the limit of the sequence defined by \( a_0 = \sqrt{a} \) and \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a + a_n} \) exists, and if so, to find it as an expression of \( a \), we can use the following approach:

First, let&#x27;s assume that the sequence converges to some limit \( L \). If the sequence converges, then the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to \( L \) as \( n \) goes to infinity. This means that \( a_n \) approaches \( L \) and \( a_{n+1} \) also approaches \( L \) as \( n \) goes to infinity. Therefore, we can write the limit equation as follows:

\[ L = \sqrt{a + L} \]

Now, we square both sides to get rid of the square root:

\[ L^2 = a + L \]

This is a quadratic equation in \( L \), and we can rearrange it to standard form:

\[ L^2 - L - a = 0 \]

According to the quadratic formula, the roots of this equation are given by:

\[ L = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \]

Since \( a &gt; 0 \), we have \( 1 + 4a &gt; 1 \), so \( \sqrt{1 + 4a} &gt; 1 \). This means that the expression under the square root is positive, and we have two real roots. However, because \( a_0 = \sqrt{a} \) is non-negative and the sequence is defined using square roots, the terms of the sequence are also non-negative. Therefore, we must choose the positive root of the quadratic equation to match the non-negative nature of the sequence:

\[ L = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \]

Now, we need to verify that the sequence is indeed monotone and bounded to ensure that the limit exists. We can use induction to show that the sequence is non-decreasing:

Base case: \( a_1 = \sqrt{a + a_0} = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a}} \geq \sqrt{a} = a_0 \) because adding a non-negative number \( \sqrt{a} \) inside the square root makes it larger or equal.

Inductive step: Assume \( a_n \geq a_{n-1} \). Then \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a + a_n} \geq \sqrt{a + a_{n-1}} = a_n \) by the property of square roots given in the problem statement.

Thus, by induction, the sequence \( (a_n) \) is non-decreasing.

To show that the sequence is bounded, we note that since \( L \) is a fixed number, for all \( n \), \( a_n \) must be less than or equal to \( L \) if the sequence converges to \( L \). We can prove this by induction as well, but it&#x27;s clear from the limit equation that if \( a_n \) were greater than \( L \), then \( a_{n+1} \) would be even greater, which would contradict the convergence.

Since the sequence \( (a_n) \) is non-decreasing and bounded above by \( L \), it must converge, and the limit is \( L = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \).</code></pre>
