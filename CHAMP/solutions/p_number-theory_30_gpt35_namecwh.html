<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic that deals with remainders. It is often used in number theory, cryptography, and computer science. The basic idea is to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a fixed range, called the modulus.

In modular arithmetic, we consider a set of numbers that are congruent to each other modulo a given modulus. Two numbers are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference is divisible by n. This is denoted as a â‰¡ b (mod n), where a and b are the numbers being compared, and n is the modulus.

Modular arithmetic follows a set of rules that govern the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These rules are:

1. Addition: (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n
   This rule states that when adding two numbers, we can take the sum of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the sum.

2. Subtraction: (a - b) mod n = (a mod n - b mod n) mod n
   Similar to addition, when subtracting two numbers, we can take the difference of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the difference.

3. Multiplication: (a * b) mod n = (a mod n * b mod n) mod n
   For multiplication, we can take the product of the remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the product.

4. Division: (a / b) mod n = (a mod n * b^(-1) mod n) mod n
   Division in modular arithmetic involves finding the modular multiplicative inverse of b (if it exists) and multiplying it with the remainder of a modulo n.

These rules allow us to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a modulus, which is particularly useful when dealing with cyclic patterns or when working with large numbers in computer algorithms.

For example, let&#x27;s consider modular arithmetic modulo 7. If we want to find the remainder of 23 divided by 7, we can use the division rule:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 7^(-1) mod 7) mod 7
Since 7^(-1) mod 7 = 1, we have:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 1) mod 7 = 23 mod 7 = 2

In this case, the remainder of 23 divided by 7 is 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation 15x^2-7y^2=9.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study y mod 3 and define y=3u+a for some value of a accordingly.
2. Study x mod 3 and define x=3u+b for some value of b accordingly.
3. Consider the resulting equation modulo 3.
4. For integer n, n^2 mod 3 is either 0 or 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation 15x^2 - 7y^2 = 9, we will follow the given information and use modular arithmetic.

1. Study y mod 3 and define y = 3u + a for some value of a accordingly.
   This means that y leaves a remainder of a when divided by 3.

2. Study x mod 3 and define x = 3u + b for some value of b accordingly.
   This means that x leaves a remainder of b when divided by 3.

3. Consider the resulting equation modulo 3.
   Substituting the values of x and y into the equation, we have:
   15(3u + b)^2 - 7(3u + a)^2 = 9
   Simplifying, we get:
   135u^2 + 90ub + 15b^2 - 63u^2 - 42ua - 7a^2 = 9
   Combining like terms, we have:
   72u^2 + 42ua + 15b^2 - 7a^2 + 9 = 0

4. For integer n, n^2 mod 3 is either 0 or 1.
   Applying this information to the equation, we can consider the possible values of a^2 and b^2 modulo 3.

   - If a^2 mod 3 = 0, then 15b^2 - 7a^2 + 9 mod 3 = 0 + 0 + 9 mod 3 = 0 mod 3.
   - If a^2 mod 3 = 1, then 15b^2 - 7a^2 + 9 mod 3 = 15b^2 - 7 + 9 mod 3 = 15b^2 + 2 mod 3.

Now, we can analyze the equation modulo 3:

Case 1: a^2 mod 3 = 0
   In this case, we have 72u^2 + 15b^2 + 9 mod 3 = 0 mod 3.
   This implies that 72u^2 + 15b^2 mod 3 = 0 mod 3.

   Since 72u^2 mod 3 = 0 mod 3 and 15b^2 mod 3 = 0 mod 3, we can conclude that 9 mod 3 = 0 mod 3.
   Therefore, this case is valid for all values of u and b.

Case 2: a^2 mod 3 = 1
   In this case, we have 72u^2 + 15b^2 + 2 mod 3 = 0 mod 3.
   This implies that 72u^2 + 15b^2 mod 3 = 1 mod 3.

   Since 72u^2 mod 3 = 0 mod 3, we need 15b^2 mod 3 = 1 mod 3.
   This means that b^2 mod 3 = 2 mod 3.

   However, for integer n, n^2 mod 3 is either 0 or 1, and there is no integer solution for b^2 mod 3 = 2 mod 3.

Therefore, the only valid case is when a^2 mod 3 = 0, which means a is divisible by 3.

From the information above, we can conclude that y must be divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s find the solutions for x and y:

Since y is divisible by 3, we can write y = 3u.

Substituting this into the original equation, we have:
15x^2 - 7(3u)^2 = 9
15x^2 - 63u^2 = 9

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
5x^2 - 21u^2 = 3

Now, we can see that both sides of the equation are divisible by 3. This means that x^2 must also be divisible by 3.

Let&#x27;s write x = 3v.

Substituting this into the equation, we have:
5(3v)^2 - 21u^2 = 3
45v^2 - 21u^2 = 3

Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
15v^2 - 7u^2 = 1

Now, we have a new equation to solve.

Using the same approach as before, we can conclude that both v and u must be divisible by 3.

Let&#x27;s write v = 3w and u = 3z.

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:
15(3w)^2 - 7(3z)^2 = 1
135w^2 - 63z^2 = 1

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
15w^2 - 7z^2 = 1

Now, we have a new equation to solve.

Using the same approach as before, we can conclude that both w and z must be divisible by 3.

Let&#x27;s write w = 3x and z = 3y.

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:
15(3x)^2 - 7(3y)^2 = 1
135x^2 - 63y^2 = 1

Dividing both sides by 9, we get:
15x^2 - 7y^2 = 1

Now, we have the same equation as before, but with a different constant on the right side.

This equation is known as Pell&#x27;s equation, and it has infinitely many solutions.

Therefore, the integer solutions to the equation 15x^2 - 7y^2 = 9 are given by the values of x and y that satisfy Pell&#x27;s equation 15x^2 - 7y^2 = 1.</code></pre>
