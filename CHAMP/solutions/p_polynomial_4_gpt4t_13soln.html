<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We see that each odd-powered x term has a negative coefficient and each even-powered x term has a positive coefficient.
2. Thus, P(x)&gt;0 for x≤0.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given the polynomial P(x) = x^(2n) - 2x^(2n-1) + 3x^(2n-2) - 4x^(2n-3) + ... - 2nx + 2n + 1, we want to determine for how many values of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100} the polynomial has at least one real-valued root.

From the partial solution, we have two observations:

1. Each odd-powered x term has a negative coefficient, and each even-powered x term has a positive coefficient.
2. P(x) &gt; 0 for x ≤ 0.

Let&#x27;s analyze the behavior of P(x) as x approaches positive infinity. Since the leading term is x^(2n) and it has a positive coefficient, P(x) will approach positive infinity as x approaches positive infinity.

Now, we have established that P(x) is positive for x ≤ 0 and P(x) approaches positive infinity as x approaches positive infinity. This means that if P(x) has a real root, it must cross the x-axis at some point for x &gt; 0.

To determine if P(x) has a real root, we need to check if there is a change in sign for P(x) as x increases from 0 to positive infinity. Since the polynomial is continuous, if P(x) decreases below zero for some x &gt; 0, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one real root.

Let&#x27;s consider P(1) = 1^(2n) - 2*1^(2n-1) + 3*1^(2n-2) - ... - 2n*1 + 2n + 1.

P(1) simplifies to:
P(1) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... + (-1)^(2n-1)*2n + 2n + 1.

This is a telescoping series where consecutive terms cancel each other out, and we are left with the last term and the constant term:
P(1) = (-1)^(2n-1)*2n + 2n + 1.

Since 2n is even, (-1)^(2n-1) is -1, so we have:
P(1) = -2n + 2n + 1 = 1.

Since P(1) = 1, which is greater than 0, and P(x) &gt; 0 for x ≤ 0, we need to find if there exists an x &gt; 1 such that P(x) &lt; 0 to ensure there is a root.

Let&#x27;s consider the derivative of P(x), P&#x27;(x), to determine the behavior of P(x). The derivative will tell us if there are any local maxima or minima for x &gt; 0.

P&#x27;(x) = 2n*x^(2n-1) - 2*(2n-1)*x^(2n-2) + 3*(2n-2)*x^(2n-3) - ... - 2n.

The derivative P&#x27;(x) is a polynomial of degree 2n-1, and it alternates signs for the coefficients, similar to P(x). Since the leading term of P&#x27;(x) is 2n*x^(2n-1), which is positive for x &gt; 0, P&#x27;(x) will eventually be positive for sufficiently large x, indicating that P(x) is increasing at that point.

However, we need to determine if there is a point x &gt; 1 where P&#x27;(x) is negative, which would indicate that P(x) is decreasing and could potentially cross the x-axis.

The behavior of P&#x27;(x) for small values of x &gt; 1 is not immediately clear, and we need to analyze it further. We can look for sign changes in P&#x27;(x) by evaluating it at x = 1, just as we did for P(x).

P&#x27;(1) = 2n*1^(2n-1) - 2*(2n-1)*1^(2n-2) + 3*(2n-2)*1^(2n-3) - ... - 2n.

This is another telescoping series, and evaluating it gives us:
P&#x27;(1) = 2n - 2*(2n-1) + 3*(2n-2) - ... - 2n.

We can see that P&#x27;(1) will be negative because the first term 2n is canceled by the last term -2n, and the remaining terms are an alternating series with decreasing absolute values and the first term negative. This means that P&#x27;(1) &lt; 0, indicating that P(x) is decreasing just after x = 1.

Since P(1) &gt; 0 and P(x) is decreasing just after x = 1, there must be a point where P(x) crosses the x-axis and becomes negative. Therefore, for each n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}, there is at least one value of x &gt; 1 where P(x) &lt; 0, which implies that P(x) has at least one real-valued root.

The final answer is that for all 100 values of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}, P(x) has at least one real-valued root.</code></pre>
