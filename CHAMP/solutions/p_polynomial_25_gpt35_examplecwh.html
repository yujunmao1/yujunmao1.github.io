If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s consider the following example:

Suppose d = 3, a = 6, b = 9, x = 2, and y = 1.

We know that d | a and d | b, which means that 3 divides 6 and 3 divides 9.

Now let&#x27;s check if d | ax + by:

ax + by = (6)(2) + (9)(1) = 12 + 9 = 21.

Since 3 does not divide 21, we can conclude that d does not divide ax + by.

Next, let&#x27;s check if d | a + b:

a + b = 6 + 9 = 15.

Since 3 divides 15, we can conclude that d divides a + b.

Finally, let&#x27;s check if d | a - b:

a - b = 6 - 9 = -3.

Since 3 divides -3, we can conclude that d divides a - b.

Therefore, in this example, we have shown that if d | a and d | b, then d | a + b and d | a - b. However, it is not necessarily true that d | ax + by.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For how many values of n in {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} can f(x)=x^n+5x^(n−1)+3 be written as g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are both polynomials of integer coefficients with degree at least 1?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(x)=a_n*x^n+a_(n-1)*x^(n-1)+...+a_0, g(x)=b_m*x^m+b_(m-1)*x^(m-1)+...+b_0, h(x)=c_(n-m)*x^(n-m)+c_(n-m-1)*x^(n-m-1)+...+c_0, and find the values of a_i.
2. Assume that |b_0|=3, let i be the smallest i such that 3 ∤ b_i, and find the expression on this a_i and its divisibility by 3.
3. Find the condition on i and study f(x)=g(x)h(x) at x=±1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given polynomial f(x) = x^n + 5x^(n-1) + 3 and determine how many values of n in the range {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} satisfy the condition that f(x) can be factored into two polynomials g(x) and h(x) with integer coefficients and degree at least 1.

Let&#x27;s start by analyzing the polynomial f(x) and its coefficients. We have:

f(x) = x^n + 5x^(n-1) + 3

From the given information, we know that g(x) and h(x) have degree at least 1. This means that both g(x) and h(x) have at least one non-zero coefficient.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the coefficient of the highest degree term in f(x), which is a_n. Since g(x) and h(x) have degree at least 1, the highest degree term in their product g(x)h(x) will be of degree n. Therefore, a_n must be 1 for f(x) to be factored into g(x) and h(x).

Next, let&#x27;s consider the constant term in f(x), which is 3. For f(x) to be factored into g(x) and h(x), the constant term in g(x)h(x) must be 3. This means that either g(x) or h(x) has a constant term of 1 and the other has a constant term of 3, or both g(x) and h(x) have constant terms of ±1.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the coefficient of the linear term in f(x), which is 5. Since g(x) and h(x) have degree at least 1, the linear term in their product g(x)h(x) will be of degree n-1. This means that the coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x) must be 5. From the given information, we know that |b_0| = 3. Therefore, the coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x) must be a multiple of 3.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude the following conditions for f(x) to be factored into g(x) and h(x):

1. a_n = 1
2. The constant term in g(x)h(x) is 3, and either g(x) or h(x) has a constant term of 1 and the other has a constant term of 3, or both g(x) and h(x) have constant terms of ±1.
3. The coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x) is a multiple of 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the condition at x = ±1. Since f(x) = g(x)h(x), we have:

f(1) = g(1)h(1)
f(-1) = g(-1)h(-1)

Substituting the expressions for f(x), g(x), and h(x), we get:

1^n + 5(1)^(n-1) + 3 = g(1)h(1)
(-1)^n + 5(-1)^(n-1) + 3 = g(-1)h(-1)

Simplifying these equations, we have:

1 + 5 + 3 = g(1)h(1)
1 + 5 + 3 = g(-1)h(-1)

9 = g(1)h(1)
9 = g(-1)h(-1)

Since g(x) and h(x) have integer coefficients, the product g(1)h(1) and g(-1)h(-1) must be integers. Therefore, the only possible values for g(1)h(1) and g(-1)h(-1) are ±1 and ±9.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the condition on i. Assume that |b_0| = 3. Let i be the smallest i such that 3 does not divide b_i. This means that b_i is the first non-zero coefficient in g(x) or h(x) that is not divisible by 3.

From the given information, we know that the coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x) must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, if i &gt; 1, then b_i is divisible by 3. This implies that g(x)h(x) cannot have a linear term with a coefficient that is not divisible by 3.

Therefore, for f(x) to be factored into g(x) and h(x), we must have i = 1, which means that the first non-zero coefficient in g(x) or h(x) that is not divisible by 3 is the constant term.

Now, let&#x27;s find the expression for a_i and its divisibility by 3. We have:

a_i = b_i + c_(n-m-i)

Since b_i is the first non-zero coefficient in g(x) or h(x) that is not divisible by 3, we can conclude that a_i is also not divisible by 3.

Based on the above analysis, we can summarize the conditions for f(x) to be factored into g(x) and h(x) as follows:

1. a_n = 1
2. The constant term in g(x)h(x) is 3, and either g(x) or h(x) has a constant term of 1 and the other has a constant term of 3, or both g(x) and h(x) have constant terms of ±1.
3. The coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x) is a multiple of 3.
4. i = 1, and a_i is not divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s count the number of values of n in the range {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} that satisfy these conditions.

Since a_n = 1, we have one possible value for a_n.

For the constant term in g(x)h(x), we have two possibilities: (1, 3) or (-1, -3). Therefore, we have two possibilities for the constant term.

For the coefficient of the linear term in g(x)h(x), we have three possibilities: 0, 3, or -3. Therefore, we have three possibilities for the coefficient of the linear term.

Since i = 1 and a_i is not divisible by 3, we have two possibilities for a_i: 1 or -1.

Therefore, the total number of possible values for n is given by:

1 (for a_n) * 2 (for the constant term) * 3 (for the coefficient of the linear term) * 2 (for a_i) = 12.

Hence, there are 12 values of n in the range {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} for which f(x) can be written as g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are both polynomials of integer coefficients with degree at least 1.</code></pre>
