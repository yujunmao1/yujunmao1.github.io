<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: What&#x27;s the smallest value of (x^2+2)/sqrt(x^2+1) for real x?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have (x^2+2)/sqrt(x^2+1)=(x^2+1)/sqrt(x^2+1)+1/sqrt(x^2+1)=sqrt(x^2+1)+1/sqrt(x^2+1).
2. In addition, sqrt(x^2+1)+1/sqrt(x^2+1)≥2*sqrt(sqrt(x^2+1)*1/sqrt(x^2+1))=sqrt(1)=1.
3. So the minimum value of sqrt(x^2+1)+1/sqrt(x^2+1) is 2, which can be achieved at x=0.

Problem: Find all positive integer solutions to the equation m^2+(m+1)^2=n^4+(n+1)^4.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2m^2+2m+1=2n^4+4n^3+6n^2+4n+1, which gives m^2+m=n^4+2n^3+3n^2+2n.
2. Thus, m^2+m+1=n^4+2n^3+3n^2+2n+1.
3. n^4+2n^3+n^2+2n^2+2n+1=(n^2+n)^2+2(n^2+n)+1=(n^2+n+1)^2, which is a perfect square.
4. However, for m≥1, m^2&lt;m^2+m+1&lt;m^2+2m+1=(m+1)^2.
5. So m^2+m+1 is strictly between two consecutive perfect squares.
6. Thus, the equation has no positive integer solution.

Problem: For a, b, c&gt;0, are there possible values of them to make (a^3*b+b^3*c+c^3*a)/(a+b+c) less than abc?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have (a/sqrt(c)*sqrt(c)+b/sqrt(a)*sqrt(a)+c/sqrt(b)*sqrt(b))^2≤((a/sqrt(c))^2+(b/sqrt(a))^2+(c/sqrt(b))^2)((sqrt(a))^2+(sqrt(b))^2+(sqrt(c))^2), which simplifies to (a+b+c)^2≤(a^2/c+b^2/a+c^2/b)(a+b+c).
2. Thus, a+b+c≤(a^3*b+b^3*c+c^3*a)/(abc).
3. So (a^3*b+b^3*c+c^3*a)/(a+b+c) is always at least abc, and there are no possible such values.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To analyze the behavior of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n}, and consequently {w_n}, we need to understand how the terms evolve based on their recursive definitions. Let&#x27;s start by examining the first few terms to see if we can identify any patterns or bounds.

Given:
x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n

Let&#x27;s consider the initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1 to be positive real numbers. We can see that each subsequent term in the sequences is the sum of a positive term from the previous iteration and the reciprocal of another positive term. This means that each term in the sequences is guaranteed to be greater than 1, since the smallest value the reciprocal of a positive number can take is 1 (when the original number is 1), and we are adding this to another positive number.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sequence {w_n}, which is the maximum of x_n, y_n, z_n. Since each term in the individual sequences is greater than 1, w_n will also be greater than 1 for all n.

However, without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume that x_1 is the largest among the initial terms. Then x_2 = y_1 + 1/z_1 will be larger than x_1, since we are adding a positive quantity to y_1. Similarly, y_2 = z_1 + 1/x_1 will be larger than y_1, and z_2 = x_1 + 1/y_1 will be larger than z_1. This suggests that the sequences are monotonically increasing, at least for the first few terms.

If the sequences continue to increase monotonically, then w_n will also increase monotonically. However, we cannot immediately conclude that w_200 is always greater than 20 without further analysis, as the rate of increase could slow down, and the sequences could potentially converge.

To determine the behavior of w_200, we need to consider the possibility of the sequences converging or diverging. If the sequences converge, then w_n will approach a finite limit as n approaches infinity. If the sequences diverge, then w_n will increase without bound.

Given the recursive nature of the sequences, it is challenging to determine the exact behavior without more advanced techniques or computational assistance. However, we can hypothesize that if the initial terms are sufficiently large, the sequences may diverge, leading to w_200 being greater than 20. Conversely, if the initial terms are close to 1, the sequences may converge or increase slowly, potentially leading to w_200 being less than 20.

Therefore, without a rigorous proof or computational verification, we can only hypothesize that w_200 could be sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20, depending on the initial values of x_1, y_1, z_1. To provide a definitive answer, we would need to employ more sophisticated mathematical tools or perform a numerical simulation to observe the behavior of the sequences for large n.</code></pre>
