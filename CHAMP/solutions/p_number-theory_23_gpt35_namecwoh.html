<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to expand the square of a binomial expression. It is derived from the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the square of their sum and the square of their difference can be expressed as follows:

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Square of the sum:
To find the square of the sum of two numbers, a and b, we square each term individually and then add the cross product of the two terms. The formula (a + b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)
           = a(a + b) + b(a + b)
           = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2
           = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

2. Square of the difference:
To find the square of the difference between two numbers, a and b, we follow a similar process. The formula (a - b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a - b)
           = a(a - b) - b(a - b)
           = a^2 - ab - ba + b^2
           = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

The key difference between the two formulas is the sign of the cross product term. In the square of the sum formula, the cross product term is positive (+2ab), while in the square of the difference formula, the cross product term is negative (-2ab).

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to expand binomial expressions and work with them more easily.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to factorize a binomial expression that is in the form of the difference between two perfect squares. It is derived from the square of a binomial formula.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the difference between their squares can be expressed as follows:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Difference of squares:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of a difference between two perfect squares, such as a^2 - b^2, we can factorize it using the difference of squares formula.

2. Factoring using the formula:
To factorize a^2 - b^2, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a + b) and (a - b). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab + ba - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

The cross product terms, ab and ba, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^2 - b^2.

This formula is useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. It allows us to factorize expressions quickly and efficiently, especially when they are in the form of the difference between two perfect squares.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The sum and difference of cubes formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to factorize a binomial expression that is in the form of the sum or difference of two cubes. It is derived from the cube of a binomial formula.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the sum or difference of their cubes can be expressed as follows:

1. Sum of cubes:
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)

2. Difference of cubes:
a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Sum of cubes:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of the sum of two cubes, such as a^3 + b^3, we can factorize it using the sum of cubes formula.

To factorize a^3 + b^3, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a + b) and (a^2 - ab + b^2). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a^3 - a^2b + ab^2 + ba^2 - ab^2 + b^3
                         = a^3 + b^3

The cross product terms, -a^2b and ba^2, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^3 + b^3.

2. Difference of cubes:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of the difference of two cubes, such as a^3 - b^3, we can factorize it using the difference of cubes formula.

To factorize a^3 - b^3, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a - b) and (a^2 + ab + b^2). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = a^3 - ab^2 + ba^2 + ab^2 - b^3
                         = a^3 - b^3

The cross product terms, -ab^2 and ba^2, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^3 - b^3.

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to factorize expressions quickly and efficiently, especially when they are in the form of the sum or difference of cubes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation x^3+3=4y(y+1).

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For integer a, b with a&gt;b, gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, a-b). 
2. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation x^3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1) for positive integer solutions, we can start by rearranging the equation:

x^3 = 4y(y + 1) - 3

Now, let&#x27;s consider the right-hand side of the equation, 4y(y + 1) - 3. We can rewrite it as a difference of cubes:

4y(y + 1) - 3 = (2y)^3 - 1^3

Using the difference of cubes formula, we have:

(2y)^3 - 1^3 = (2y - 1)((2y)^2 + (2y)(1) + 1^2)
             = (2y - 1)(4y^2 + 2y + 1)

Now, we can equate this expression to x^3:

(2y - 1)(4y^2 + 2y + 1) = x^3

Since we are looking for positive integer solutions, both factors on the left-hand side must be perfect cubes.

Let&#x27;s consider the first factor, 2y - 1. We can write it as a perfect cube:

2y - 1 = a^3

Similarly, for the second factor, 4y^2 + 2y + 1, we can write it as a perfect cube:

4y^2 + 2y + 1 = b^3

Now, we have two equations:

2y - 1 = a^3
4y^2 + 2y + 1 = b^3

We can use the information given in the problem to simplify these equations further. From the first given information, we know that gcd(a, 2y - 1) = 1. This implies that a and 2y - 1 are coprime.

From the second given information, we know that gcd(4y^2 + 2y + 1, 2y - 1) = 1. This implies that 4y^2 + 2y + 1 and 2y - 1 are coprime.

Now, we can solve these equations to find the values of y and x.

From the first equation, 2y - 1 = a^3, we can rewrite it as:

2y = a^3 + 1
y = (a^3 + 1)/2

Substituting this value of y into the second equation, we have:

4((a^3 + 1)/2)^2 + 2((a^3 + 1)/2) + 1 = b^3
2(a^3 + 1)^2 + (a^3 + 1) + 1 = b^3
2(a^6 + 2a^3 + 1) + a^3 + 1 + 1 = b^3
2a^6 + 3a^3 + 3 = b^3

Now, we have an equation in terms of a and b. We can try different values of a and check if there exist corresponding values of b that satisfy this equation.

For example, let&#x27;s try a = 1:

2(1^6) + 3(1^3) + 3 = b^3
2 + 3 + 3 = b^3
8 = b^3

The only positive integer value of b that satisfies this equation is b = 2.

Therefore, for a = 1, we have y = (1^3 + 1)/2 = 1 and x = 2.

So, one solution to the equation x^3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1) is x = 2, y = 1.

You can continue this process to check for other values of a and find additional solutions to the equation.</code></pre>
