Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?

You may find the following information useful:

1. If ab | c, then a | c and b | c.
2. If p is a prime and p | ab, then p | a or p | b (or both). More generally, if p | a_1*a_2*...*a_n, then p | a_i for at least one a_i.
3. If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed as \( N \). We can express \( N \) as a two-part number where the first part is the first digit and the second part is the remaining digits. Let&#x27;s say the first digit is \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 9 \), since it&#x27;s the first digit of a positive integer) and the remaining part of the number is \( n \). Then we can write \( N \) as:

\[ N = 10^k \cdot d + n \]

where \( k \) is the number of digits in \( n \). When the first digit is removed, we are left with \( n \), and we are given that \( N \) is 57 times larger than \( n \), so:

\[ N = 57 \cdot n \]

Substituting the expression for \( N \) from above, we get:

\[ 10^k \cdot d + n = 57 \cdot n \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[ 10^k \cdot d = 57 \cdot n - n \]
\[ 10^k \cdot d = 56 \cdot n \]

Since \( d \) is a digit, \( 10^k \) is a power of 10, and \( n \) is the integer formed by the remaining digits, we can see that \( n \) must be divisible by 56 to satisfy the equation. This means that \( n \) must be a multiple of 56.

Now, we need to find the smallest such \( n \) that satisfies the equation. Since \( d \) is a digit, the smallest value for \( d \) is 1. Let&#x27;s start with \( d = 1 \) and find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \) is a multiple of 56 and \( 10^k \) is a power of 10 just larger than \( 56 \cdot n \).

If \( d = 1 \), then:

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot n \]

Since \( n \) must be a multiple of 56, let&#x27;s try the smallest multiple of 56, which is 56 itself:

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 56 \]
\[ 10^k = 3136 \]

The smallest power of 10 greater than 3136 is \( 10^4 = 10000 \), but this is not equal to 3136. Therefore, \( n \) cannot be 56 because \( 10^k \) must be an exact power of 10.

Let&#x27;s try the next smallest multiple of 56, which is \( 56 \times 2 = 112 \):

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 112 \]
\[ 10^k = 6272 \]

Again, the smallest power of 10 greater than 6272 is \( 10^4 = 10000 \), which is not equal to 6272. So \( n \) cannot be 112 either.

Continuing this process, we look for the smallest \( n \) such that \( 10^k = 56 \cdot n \) is a power of 10. The next multiple of 56 is \( 56 \times 3 = 168 \):

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 168 \]
\[ 10^k = 9408 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue with \( 56 \times 4 = 224 \):

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 224 \]
\[ 10^k = 12544 \]

Now, \( 10^k \) has exceeded the next power of 10, which is \( 10^4 = 10000 \). We overshot, so we need to go back and try \( 56 \times 3 = 168 \) again. We realize that \( 10^k \) must be a power of 10 just larger than \( 56 \cdot n \), and \( 9408 \) is not a power of 10, but \( 10000 \) is. So we need to find the value of \( n \) that makes \( 10^k \) exactly \( 10000 \).

Let&#x27;s try \( n = 10000 / 56 \):

\[ n = \frac{10000}{56} \]
\[ n = 178.571428... \]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we cannot have a decimal. We need to find the smallest integer \( n \) that is a multiple of 56 and makes \( 10^k \) a power of 10. The next power of 10 is \( 10^5 = 100000 \), so let&#x27;s try that:

\[ n = \frac{100000}{56} \]
\[ n = 1785.71428... \]

Again, we have a decimal. We need to find the exact multiple of 56 that gives us a power of 10 when multiplied by 56. Let&#x27;s try multiples of 56 until we get an exact power of 10:

\[ n = 56 \times 1 = 56 \]
\[ n = 56 \times 2 = 112 \]
\[ n = 56 \times 3 = 168 \]
\[ n = 56 \times 4 = 224 \]
\[ ... \]
\[ n = 56 \times 18 = 1008 \]

Now, \( 1008 \) is a multiple of 56, and when we multiply it by 56, we get:

\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1008 \]
\[ 10^k = 56448 \]

This is not a power of 10. We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( 56 \cdot n \) is a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( n = 56 \times 19 \):

\[ n = 56 \times 19 = 1064 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1064 \]
\[ 10^k = 59584 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 20 = 1120 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1120 \]
\[ 10^k = 62720 \]

Now, \( 62720 \) is not a power of 10, but it&#x27;s close to \( 10^5 = 100000 \). We need to find the exact multiple of 56 that gives us a power of 10 when multiplied by 56. Let&#x27;s try \( n = 56 \times 21 \):

\[ n = 56 \times 21 = 1176 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1176 \]
\[ 10^k = 65856 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 22 = 1232 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1232 \]
\[ 10^k = 68992 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 23 = 1288 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1288 \]
\[ 10^k = 72128 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 24 = 1344 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1344 \]
\[ 10^k = 75264 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 25 = 1400 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1400 \]
\[ 10^k = 78400 \]

\[ n = 56 \times 28 = 1568 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1568 \]
\[ 10^k = 87808 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 29 = 1624 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1624 \]
\[ 10^k = 90944 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 30 = 1680 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1680 \]
\[ 10^k = 94080 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 31 = 1736 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1736 \]
\[ 10^k = 97216 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 32 = 1792 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1792 \]
\[ 10^k = 100352 \]

Now, \( 100352 \) is not a power of 10, but it&#x27;s close to \( 10^5 = 100000 \). We need to find the exact multiple of 56 that gives us a power of 10 when multiplied by 56. Let&#x27;s try \( n = 56 \times 33 \):

\[ n = 56 \times 33 = 1848 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1848 \]
\[ 10^k = 103488 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 34 = 1904 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1904 \]
\[ 10^k = 106624 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 35 = 1960 \]
\[ 10^k = 56 \cdot 1960 \]
\[ 10^k = 109760 \]

This is still not a power of 10. We continue this process until we find the correct \( n \):

\[ n = 56 \times 36 = 2016 \]
