<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of division.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of division, also known as the division principle, is a concept in combinatorics that is used to solve problems involving the distribution of distinct objects into distinct groups. It is particularly useful when dealing with problems where you want to count the number of ways to arrange or select items, and you need to eliminate overcounting due to considering different orders as distinct when they should not be.

The rule of division states that if a set of objects can be arranged in \( N \) ways, and if there are \( D \) indistinguishable arrangements for each distinct arrangement, then the number of distinct arrangements is \( N / D \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of division:

Suppose you have 3 different books and you want to know how many ways you can arrange them on a shelf. There are \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \) ways to arrange the three books. Now, imagine that two of the books are part of a two-volume series and you want to treat these two as a single item because you always keep them together. In this case, you would overcount the arrangements if you considered all 6 permutations, because the two volumes of the series can be swapped without creating a &quot;distinct&quot; arrangement.

To find the correct number of distinct arrangements, you would use the rule of division. Since the two volumes can be arranged in \( 2! = 2 \) ways (they can be swapped), you divide the total number of arrangements by the number of indistinguishable arrangements:

\[ \frac{3!}{2!} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

So, there are 3 distinct ways to arrange the books on the shelf when considering the two volumes of the series as a single item.

The rule of division is often used in combination with other counting principles, such as the rule of product, to solve more complex combinatorial problems. It is a way to correct for overcounting when the order of certain items does not matter for the problem at hand.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a basic counting principle in combinatorics. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are two or more mutually exclusive events or choices. Mutually exclusive means that the occurrence of one event or choice prevents the occurrence of the others; in other words, they cannot happen at the same time.

The rule of sum states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur simultaneously (they are mutually exclusive), then there are \( m + n \) ways for either of the two events to occur.

This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink with your lunch, and you can choose either a soda, a juice, or water. If there are 5 types of soda, 3 types of juice, and 1 type of water available, the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 5 + 3 + 1 = 9 \) possible drink choices you can make for your lunch.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum only applies when the choices are mutually exclusive. If the events or choices can occur simultaneously, then the rule of sum is not applicable, and other counting methods, such as the rule of product, may be more appropriate.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of distinct colorings of a cube, considering that rotations of the cube do not create new colorings. We will use the concept of Burnside&#x27;s lemma, which is a tool in group theory used to count the number of orbits (in this case, distinct colorings) under a group action (rotations of the cube).

However, we can also approach this problem in a more elementary way, as suggested by the steps provided. Let&#x27;s follow these steps:

1. **Paint the first face and place it on the bottom:** Since we are looking for distinct colorings up to rotation, we can start by fixing one face of the cube. We have 6 colors to choose from for the bottom face. Once this face is painted and placed on the bottom, the coloring of the remaining faces will determine the distinct colorings.

2. **Paint the second face on the top:** After painting the bottom face, we have 5 colors left for the top face. Once the top face is painted, the cube can still be rotated around the vertical axis, so the order in which we paint the remaining four side faces does not matter. We only need to choose 4 colors out of the remaining 5, which can be done in \(5! / (5 - 4)! = 5! / 1! = 120\) ways. However, since the cube can be rotated around the vertical axis, these 4 side faces can be arranged in 4! ways, which are all equivalent due to rotation. Therefore, we need to divide by the number of these rotations to avoid overcounting:

\[ \frac{5!}{4!} = \frac{120}{24} = 5 \]

So, there are 5 distinct colorings when the second face is on the top.

3. **Paint the second face on the side:** If we paint one of the side faces next, we have 5 choices for its color. Now, we have 4 colors left for the remaining faces. The cube can be rotated around the horizontal axis passing through the centers of the bottom and the newly painted side face, which means that the arrangement of the 3 other side faces and the top face does not matter. We have 4! ways to arrange these 4 colors, but due to the rotational symmetry, we need to divide by 4 (the number of rotations that leave the cube looking the same):

\[ \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

So, there are 6 distinct colorings when the second face is on the side.

Now, we add the number of distinct colorings for both cases:

\[ 5 \text{ (top painted second)} + 6 \text{ (side painted second)} = 11 \]

Therefore, there are 11 distinct colorings of a cube when each face is painted a different color, up to rotations.</code></pre>
