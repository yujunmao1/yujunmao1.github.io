<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. How many diagonals are there in a convex polygon of n vertices, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have C(n, 2) vertex pairs, and n of them are between adjacent vertices.
2. Thus, we have C(n, 2)-n=n(n-1)/2-n=n(n-3)/2 diagonals.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we can use the concept of combinations.

Let&#x27;s consider the 8 dogs as distinct objects and the 3 cookies as distinct slots. We want to distribute the cookies among the dogs in a way that no two dogs share the same cookie.

We can think of this problem as placing the 3 cookies in the 8 slots, where each slot represents a dog. Since the cookies are the same, the order in which they are placed does not matter.

Using the concept of combinations, we can calculate the number of ways to distribute the cookies. We need to choose 3 slots out of the 8 available slots to place the cookies.

The number of ways to choose 3 slots out of 8 is given by the combination formula C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!) = 8! / (3! * 5!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.

Therefore, there are 56 possible results for distributing the 3 cookies among the 8 dogs.</code></pre>
