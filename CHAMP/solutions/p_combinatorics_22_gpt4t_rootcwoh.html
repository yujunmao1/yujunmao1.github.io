<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

You may find the following information useful:

1. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
2. C(n, r)=n!/(r!*(n-r)!)=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-r+1)/r!.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of r elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, we need to consider how many times each number from 1 to n-r+1 (inclusive) can be the smallest number in a subset of size r.

Let&#x27;s take a specific number i (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n-r+1) and count how many subsets of size r have i as their smallest element. Once we have chosen i as the smallest element, we need to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the set {i+1, i+2, ..., n}, which has n-i elements. The number of ways to do this is C(n-i, r-1).

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the sum of all the smallest elements across all subsets, which we&#x27;ll call S. For each i from 1 to n-r+1, we multiply i by the number of subsets where i is the smallest element:

S = 1 * C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)

To find the arithmetic mean, we divide S by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r).

Let&#x27;s compute S first:

S = 1 * C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)
  = C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)

Notice that C(n-i, r-1) can be written as:

C(n-i, r-1) = (n-i)! / ((r-1)! * (n-i-(r-1))!)
            = (n-i)! / ((r-1)! * (n-r-i+1)!)
            = (n-i) * (n-i-1) * ... * (n-i-(r-2)) / (r-1)!

Now, let&#x27;s look at the sum S again and notice a pattern:

S = C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)
  = (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-r+1) / (r-1)! + 2 * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-r+1) / (r-1)! + ... + (n-r+1) / (r-1)!

We can factor out 1/(r-1)! from each term:

S = 1/(r-1)! * [(n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-r+1) + 2 * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-r+1) + ... + (n-r+1)]

Now, we need to find a way to simplify this expression. One way to approach this is to recognize that each term in the sum is a product of consecutive numbers starting from some number down to (n-r+1). We can think of this as a sum of products of consecutive numbers, which is a bit tricky to simplify directly.

Instead, let&#x27;s consider a combinatorial argument. For each i from 1 to n-r+1, we are choosing the smallest element i and then choosing r-1 elements from the remaining n-i elements. This is equivalent to first choosing r elements from the first n-i+1 elements and then subtracting i from each of them to ensure that i is the smallest. This gives us a new perspective on the sum S:

S = C(n, r) - C(n-1, r) + C(n-1, r) - C(n-2, r) + ... + C(r, r) - C(r-1, r)

Notice that many terms cancel out, and we are left with:

S = C(n, r) - C(r-1, r)

Since C(r-1, r) is 0 (we cannot choose r elements from only r-1 elements), we have:

S = C(n, r)

Now, to find the arithmetic mean, we divide S by the total number of subsets of size r, which is also C(n, r):

Arithmetic mean = S / C(n, r) = C(n, r) / C(n, r) = 1

This result seems counterintuitive, but it&#x27;s important to note that the combinatorial argument used here is incorrect. The cancellation of terms does not apply to this problem because we are not simply choosing r elements from n; we are considering the position of the smallest element within each subset. Therefore, we need to revisit the original sum S and find a correct way to simplify it.

Let&#x27;s go back to the original sum S and try to find a pattern or a relationship that can help us simplify it:

S = 1 * C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)

We can rewrite each combination as follows:

C(n-i, r-1) = (n-i)! / ((r-1)! * (n-i-(r-1))!)
            = (n-i) * (n-i-1) * ... * (n-i-(r-2)) / (r-1)!

Now, let&#x27;s look at the sum S again and notice a pattern:

S = C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)
  = (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-r+1) / (r-1)! + 2 * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-r+1) / (r-1)! + ... + (n-r+1) / (r-1)!

We can factor out 1/(r-1)! from each term:

S = 1/(r-1)! * [(n-1) * (n-2) * ... * (n-r+1) + 2 * (n-2) * (n-3) * ... * (n-r+1) + ... + (n-r+1)]
