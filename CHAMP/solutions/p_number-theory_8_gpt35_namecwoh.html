<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical expression that allows us to factorize a quadratic expression that is in the form of a difference between two perfect squares. It states that:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

In this formula, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; represent any real numbers or variables. The left side of the equation represents the difference between the squares of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, while the right side represents the factored form of the expression.

To understand why this formula works, let&#x27;s expand the right side of the equation:

(a + b)(a - b) = a(a) + a(-b) + b(a) + b(-b)
               = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

As you can see, the expanded form of the right side matches the left side of the equation, which confirms that the formula is correct.

The difference of squares formula is particularly useful when we encounter quadratic expressions that can be written as the difference between two perfect squares. By factoring the expression using this formula, we can simplify it and potentially solve equations or simplify further calculations.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>I apologize, but there is no specific concept known as the &quot;difference of powers formula.&quot; However, there are several formulas related to powers that you might be referring to. Here are a few commonly used formulas involving powers:

1. Power of a Product: (ab)^n = a^n * b^n
   This formula states that when a product is raised to a power, each factor within the product is raised to that power individually.

2. Power of a Power: (a^n)^m = a^(n * m)
   This formula states that when a power is raised to another power, we multiply the exponents.

3. Power of a Quotient: (a/b)^n = (a^n)/(b^n)
   This formula states that when a quotient is raised to a power, both the numerator and denominator are raised to that power individually.

4. Negative Exponent: a^(-n) = 1/(a^n)
   This formula states that when a number or variable is raised to a negative exponent, it is equivalent to the reciprocal of that number or variable raised to the positive exponent.

These are just a few examples of formulas involving powers. If you have a specific formula or concept in mind, please provide more details, and I will be happy to explain it to you.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.
2. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m, we can start by analyzing the factors on the left side of the equation.

Let&#x27;s consider three consecutive integers: n-1, n, and n+1. One of these three numbers must be divisible by 2, and one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product of these three consecutive integers, (n-1)n(n+1), must be divisible by 2 and 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of a. Since a is a positive integer, it can be expressed as a product of prime numbers raised to certain powers: a = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn.

Using the given information, we can deduce that gcd(a, n-1) = gcd(a, n) = gcd(a, n+1) = 1. This means that none of the prime factors of a are present in the factors (n-1), n, or (n+1).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1). Since this product is divisible by 2 and 3, it must contain at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. However, we know that none of the prime factors of a are present in this product. Therefore, the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) must only contain prime factors other than 2 and 3.

From this analysis, we can conclude that the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) and a must be disjoint, meaning they do not share any common prime factors.

Using the second piece of information provided, we know that if ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a = u^k and b = v^k for gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = c.

Applying this information to our equation, we have:

(n-1)n(n+1) = a^m

Since the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) and a must be disjoint, we can conclude that each prime factor of (n-1)n(n+1) must be raised to the power of m.

Therefore, we can write:

n-1 = u1^m
n = u2^m
n+1 = u3^m

where u1, u2, and u3 are positive integers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation n = u2^m. Since n is an integer, u2^m must be an integer. This implies that u2 must be a perfect mth power.

Similarly, n-1 = u1^m implies that u1 must be a perfect mth power, and n+1 = u3^m implies that u3 must be a perfect mth power.

Therefore, we can write:

n = x^m
n-1 = y^m
n+1 = z^m

where x, y, and z are positive integers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation n-1 = y^m. Since n is an integer, y^m must be an integer. This implies that y must be a perfect mth power.

Similarly, n+1 = z^m implies that z must be a perfect mth power.

Therefore, we can write:

n = x^m
n-1 = y^m
n+1 = z^m

where x, y, and z are positive integers, and y and z are perfect mth powers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation n = x^m. Since n is an integer, x^m must be an integer. This implies that x must be a perfect mth power.

Therefore, we can write:

n = x^m
n-1 = y^m
n+1 = z^m

where x, y, and z are positive integers, and x, y, and z are perfect mth powers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation n-1 = y^m. Since n is an integer, y^m must be an integer. This implies that y must be a perfect mth power.

Similarly, n+1 = z^m implies that z must be a perfect mth power.

Now, we have a system of equations:

n = x^m
n-1 = y^m
n+1 = z^m

We can solve this system of equations to find the possible values of n, a, and m.

By analyzing the equations, we can see that n must be a perfect mth power plus or minus 1. This means that n can be written as either x^m + 1 or x^m - 1, where x is a positive integer.

Therefore, the possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m, where n, a, and m are integers, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1, are:

n = x^m + 1 or n = x^m - 1, where x is a positive integer.
