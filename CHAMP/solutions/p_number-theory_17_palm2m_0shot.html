Find a perfect square number that can be written as aabb (i.e., first two digits are the same, and last two digits are the same).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it is the square of 4.

To find a perfect square that can be written as aabb, we need to find a number that is both a multiple of 100 and a perfect square. The smallest such number is 100, which is the square of 10.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 400, which is the square of 20. However, 400 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 900, which is the square of 30. However, 900 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 1600, which is the square of 40. However, 1600 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 2500, which is the square of 50. However, 2500 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 3600, which is the square of 60. However, 3600 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 4900, which is the square of 70. However, 4900 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 6400, which is the square of 80. However, 6400 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

The next perfect square that is a multiple of 100 is 8100, which is the square of 90. However, 8100 cannot be written as aabb, because the first two digits are not the same as the last two digits.

Therefore, there is no perfect square that can be written as aabb.</code></pre>
