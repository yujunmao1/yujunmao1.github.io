<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving counting books on a bookshelf.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with several rows of books, and you want to count the total number of books. However, instead of counting each book once, you decide to count each book three times (perhaps to triple-check your count).

After going through the counting process, you find that you have counted a total of n = 90 counts. Since you counted each book d = 3 times, you want to find out the actual number of books on the shelf.

According to the concept, to find the actual number of books, you would divide the total number of counts by the number of times you counted each book:

Number of books = n / d
                = 90 / 3
                = 30

So, there are 30 books on the bookshelf.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the number of ways to pair up 2n players into n pairs. This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached by considering the process of forming pairs step by step.

Let&#x27;s start by selecting the first pair. We have 2n players to choose from for the first player of the pair, and then 2n - 1 players to choose from for the second player of the pair. However, since the order in which we select the two players for a pair does not matter (pairing player A with player B is the same as pairing player B with player A), we have counted each pair twice. Therefore, the number of ways to form the first pair is:

(2n * (2n - 1)) / 2

Now, we have 2n - 2 players left for the remaining pairs. We repeat the process for the second pair. We have 2n - 2 players to choose from for the first player of the second pair, and 2n - 3 players to choose from for the second player of the second pair. Again, we divide by 2 to correct for the overcounting:

((2n - 2) * (2n - 3)) / 2

We continue this process until we have formed all n pairs. The general pattern for the ith pair (where i ranges from 1 to n) is:

((2n - 2(i - 1)) * (2n - 2(i - 1) - 1)) / 2

Multiplying all these terms together gives us the total number of ways to form n pairs:

Total number of ways = [(2n * (2n - 1)) / 2] * [((2n - 2) * (2n - 3)) / 2] * ... * [(2 * 1) / 2]

Notice that each term has a factor of 1/2, so if we have n pairs, we have a factor of (1/2)^n. Also, the numerators form a sequence of even numbers multiplied by the next smaller odd number. This is equivalent to the product of the first 2n natural numbers divided by 2^n (because we have n factors of 2 in the denominators). This product of the first 2n natural numbers is (2n)!, the factorial of 2n.

Therefore, the total number of ways to form n pairs is:

Total number of ways = (2n)! / (2^n * n!)

This expression accounts for the number of ways to pair up 2n players into n pairs for the first round of the tennis tournament.</code></pre>
