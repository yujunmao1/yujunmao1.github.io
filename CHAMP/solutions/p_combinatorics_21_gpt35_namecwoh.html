<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of division, also known as the division principle or the partition principle, is a concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the number of ways to distribute or divide objects into groups or categories.

In simple terms, the rule of division states that if there are n objects that need to be divided into k groups or categories, and each group must contain a specific number of objects, then the total number of ways to divide the objects is given by the formula:

Total number of ways = (n!)/(n1! * n2! * n3! * ... * nk!)

Here, n! represents the factorial of n, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. The values n1, n2, n3, ..., nk represent the specific number of objects required in each group.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider an example. Suppose you have 6 different books that you want to divide into 3 groups, with each group containing 2 books. To determine the number of ways to divide the books, you can use the rule of division.

In this case, n = 6 (total number of books), k = 3 (number of groups), and n1 = n2 = n3 = 2 (number of books in each group). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

Total number of ways = (6!)/(2! * 2! * 2!) = (6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)/(2 * 2 * 2) = 15

Therefore, there are 15 different ways to divide the 6 books into 3 groups, with each group containing 2 books.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of division assumes that the objects are distinct and the order of the groups does not matter. If the objects are not distinct or the order of the groups matters, then other combinatorial principles like permutations or combinations may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of division is a useful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the number of ways to distribute or divide objects into groups or categories, given specific conditions or requirements.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.

In simple terms, the rule of sum states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, and these choices or events are mutually exclusive (meaning you can only choose one of them), then the total number of possible outcomes is the sum of the number of choices for each event: m + n.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt or one pair of pants, you can use the rule of sum.

According to the rule of sum, you add the number of choices for each mutually exclusive event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 + 2 = 5.

To generalize the rule of sum, if you have k mutually exclusive events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the sum of all the options: m1 + m2 + m3 + ... + mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum assumes that the choices or events are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only choose one option from each event. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of product or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of sum is a fundamental principle in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of the rule of division. 

First, let&#x27;s consider the total number of ways to paint the cube without considering rotations. Since each face of the cube can be painted with a different color, we have 6 choices for the first face, 5 choices for the second face, 4 choices for the third face, and so on. Therefore, the total number of ways to paint the cube without considering rotations is:

6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 720

However, we need to account for the fact that some of these colorings are equivalent due to rotations. 

Let&#x27;s analyze the possible rotations of the cube. A cube has 24 different rotational symmetries, which means that any given coloring can be rotated in 24 different ways to produce an equivalent coloring. 

To find the number of distinct colorings up to rotations, we divide the total number of colorings by the number of rotational symmetries:

Number of distinct colorings = Total number of colorings / Number of rotational symmetries

Number of distinct colorings = 720 / 24 = 30

Therefore, there are 30 distinct colorings of the cube up to rotations.</code></pre>
