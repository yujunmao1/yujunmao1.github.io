Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving counting books on a bookshelf.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with several rows of books, and you want to count the total number of books. However, instead of counting each book once, you decide to count each book three times (perhaps to triple-check your count).

After going through the counting process, you find that you have counted a total of n = 90 counts. Since you counted each book d = 3 times, you want to find out the actual number of books on the shelf.

According to the concept, to find the actual number of books, you would divide the total number of counts by the number of times you counted each book:

Number of books = n / d
                = 90 / 3
                = 30

So, there are 30 books on the bookshelf.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving choosing an elective course for a semester at a university.

Suppose a student can choose one elective course for the upcoming semester, and there are three different departments offering elective courses, but the student can only enroll in one course due to a time conflict (no two courses can be taken at the same time).

Department A offers 4 different courses.
Department B offers 3 different courses.
Department C offers 2 different courses.

Here, each department represents an action (choosing a course from a department), and the number of courses offered by each department represents the number of ways to perform that action.

So, we have:
- p_1 = 4 ways to choose a course from Department A.
- p_2 = 3 ways to choose a course from Department B.
- p_3 = 2 ways to choose a course from Department C.

Since the student can only choose one course and the courses are offered at the same time (no two actions can be performed simultaneously), the total number of ways the student can choose an elective course is the sum of the ways to choose a course from each department:

Total number of ways to choose an elective course = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
                                                   = 4 + 3 + 2
                                                   = 9

Therefore, the student has 9 different elective courses to choose from in total.</code></pre>

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the concept of Burnside&#x27;s Lemma from group theory, which is a method for counting the number of orbits (in this case, distinct colorings) under a group action (rotations of the cube). However, we can also approach this problem in a more elementary way by considering the different cases and using the information provided.

First, let&#x27;s paint one face of the cube and place it on the bottom. Since all faces are different, there are 6 choices for the color of the bottom face.

Now, we have two cases for painting the second face:

**Case 1: The second face is on top.**
After choosing the bottom face, there are 5 remaining colors for the top face. Once the top and bottom faces are painted, the remaining four side faces can be rotated around the vertical axis without changing the appearance of the cube. This means that the order in which we paint the four side faces doesn&#x27;t matter; what matters is the combination of colors used. There are 4! (factorial) ways to arrange the remaining four colors, but since rotations around the vertical axis do not change the cube&#x27;s appearance, we must divide by the number of such rotations. There are 4 rotations that leave the top and bottom faces unchanged (including the identity rotation), so we divide by 4:

Distinct colorings for Case 1 = 5 * (4! / 4) = 5 * (24 / 4) = 5 * 6 = 30

**Case 2: The second face is on the side.**
After choosing the bottom face, there are 5 remaining colors for the side face. Now, the top face must be painted, and there are 4 choices for its color. The remaining three side faces can be painted in any order, but because the cube can be rotated around the vertical axis, we must consider these rotations. There are 3! ways to arrange the remaining three colors, but we must account for the 3 rotations of the cube that leave the top and bottom faces fixed (excluding the identity rotation). Therefore, we divide by 3:

Distinct colorings for Case 2 = 5 * 4 * (3! / 3) = 5 * 4 * (6 / 3) = 5 * 4 * 2 = 40

Adding the distinct colorings from both cases, we get the total number of distinct colorings up to rotations:

Total distinct colorings = Case 1 + Case 2
                         = 30 + 40
                         = 70

Therefore, there are 70 distinct colorings of the cube up to rotations.</code></pre>
