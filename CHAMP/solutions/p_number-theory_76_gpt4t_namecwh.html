<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 4 is a simple arithmetic test to determine whether a given integer is divisible by 4. According to this rule, a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits (the tens and the units place) is divisible by 4.

Here&#x27;s how you can apply the rule:

1. Look at the last two digits of the number you want to test for divisibility by 4.
2. If the number formed by these two digits is divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4. If not, then the number is not divisible by 4.

For example, let&#x27;s test the number 1,236 for divisibility by 4:
- The last two digits are 36.
- Since 36 is divisible by 4 (as 4 × 9 = 36), the entire number 1,236 is also divisible by 4.

Another example is the number 1,578:
- The last two digits are 78.
- Since 78 is not divisible by 4 (as 4 × 19 = 76, which is close but not equal to 78), the number 1,578 is not divisible by 4.

This rule works because the number 100 (and any multiple of it, like 1000, 10000, etc.) is divisible by 4. Therefore, when you are looking at the last two digits, you are essentially ignoring the part of the number that is already known to be divisible by 4 and focusing on the remainder, which determines the divisibility of the entire number.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the four-digit number abcd such that 4*abcd=dcba.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Find values of a, d, b, c in that order.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the four-digit number as abcd, where a, b, c, and d represent the digits in the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places, respectively. We are given that 4 times this number is equal to the number dcba, where the digits are reversed.

So, we have:

4 × (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a

Expanding the multiplication on the left side, we get:

4000a + 400b + 40c + 4d = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a

Now, let&#x27;s rearrange the terms to group the coefficients of the same digits:

(4000a - a) + (400b - 10b) + (40c - 100c) + (4d - 1000d) = 0

This simplifies to:

3999a + 390b - 60c - 996d = 0

Now, let&#x27;s find the values of a, d, b, c in that order:

1. Since abcd is a four-digit number, a cannot be 0. The maximum value for a digit is 9, so the maximum value for 4 × a is 36. Since we are looking for a four-digit number, a must be 1 or 2 because 4 × 3 would give a five-digit number. Let&#x27;s try a = 1 first:

3999a = 3999 × 1 = 3999

This would mean that 996d must be close to 4000 to cancel out the large term 3999a. Since the maximum value for d is 9, let&#x27;s try d = 9:

996d = 996 × 9 = 8964

This is too large, as it would not cancel out with 3999a. So, a cannot be 1. Let&#x27;s try a = 2:

3999a = 3999 × 2 = 7998

Now, we need 996d to be close to 8000. Let&#x27;s try d = 8:

996d = 996 × 8 = 7968

This works well because 7998 (from 3999a) and 7968 (from 996d) are close in value. Now we have:

7998 + 390b - 60c - 7968 = 0

Simplifying, we get:

30 + 390b - 60c = 0

2. Now, let&#x27;s find b and c. Since 390b is a multiple of 10, and 30 is also a multiple of 10, 60c must be a multiple of 10. The smallest non-zero value for c that satisfies this is c = 5 (since 60 × 5 = 300, which is a multiple of 10). Let&#x27;s try c = 5:

390b - 60c = -30

390b - 300 = -30

390b = 270

b = 270 / 390

b = 27 / 39

b = 9 / 13

Since b must be an integer and 9/13 is not an integer, c cannot be 5. Let&#x27;s try the next multiple of 10 for 60c, which is c = 10 (but c must be a single digit, so this is not possible). Since c = 5 did not work and c cannot be 10, we must have made a mistake in our previous steps. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate our assumption for a and d.

Upon re-evaluation, we realize that we made an error in our calculation for d when a = 1. Let&#x27;s correct this:

If a = 1, then we have:

3999a = 3999 × 1 = 3999

We need 996d to be just under 4000 to cancel out 3999a. Since d must be less than 4 (to keep the product a four-digit number), let&#x27;s try d = 3:

996d = 996 × 3 = 2988

Now, we have:

3999 + 390b - 60c - 2988 = 0

1011 + 390b - 60c = 0

Since 1011 is not a multiple of 390 or 60, we need to adjust b and c to make the equation balance. We know that b and c must be digits (0-9), and we need to find a combination where 390b - 60c is close to -1011.

Let&#x27;s try b = 2 (since 390b needs to be a significant value to get close to 1011):

390b = 390 × 2 = 780

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 780 - 60c = 0

1791 - 60c = 0

60c = 1791

Since 1791 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 2. Let&#x27;s try b = 3:

390b = 390 × 3 = 1170

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 1170 - 60c = 0

2181 - 60c = 0

60c = 2181

Again, 2181 is not divisible by 60, so b cannot be 3. Let&#x27;s try b = 4:

390b = 390 × 4 = 1560

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 1560 - 60c = 0

2571 - 60c = 0

60c = 2571

Since 2571 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 4. Let&#x27;s try b = 5:

390b = 390 × 5 = 1950

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 1950 - 60c = 0

2961 - 60c = 0

60c = 2961

Since 2961 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 5. Let&#x27;s try b = 6:

390b = 390 × 6 = 2340

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 2340 - 60c = 0

3351 - 60c = 0

60c = 3351

Since 3351 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 6. Let&#x27;s try b = 7:

390b = 390 × 7 = 2730

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 2730 - 60c = 0

3741 - 60c = 0

60c = 3741

Since 3741 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 7. Let&#x27;s try b = 8:

390b = 390 × 8 = 3120

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 3120 - 60c = 0

4131 - 60c = 0

60c = 4131

Since 4131 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 8. Let&#x27;s try b = 9:

390b = 390 × 9 = 3510

Substituting this into the equation, we get:

1011 + 3510 - 60c = 0

4521 - 60c = 0

60c = 4521

Since 4521 is not divisible by 60, b cannot be 9. At this point, we have tried all possible values for b and none have worked. This means we must have made a mistake in our initial assumption for a and d.

Let&#x27;s go back and correct our mistake. We initially assumed a = 1 and d = 9, which was incorrect. Let&#x27;s try a = 1 and d = 8:

3999a = 3999 × 1 = 3999

996d = 996 × 8 = 7968

Now, we have:

3999 + 390b - 60c - 7968 = 0

30 + 390b - 60c = 0

390b - 60c = -30

Dividing the entire equation by 30, we get:

13b - 2c = -1

Now, we need to find values of b and c that are digits (0-9) and satisfy this equation. Let&#x27;s try c = 1:

13b - 2(1) = -1

13b - 2 = -1

13b = 1

b = 1 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 1. Let&#x27;s try c = 2:

13b - 2(2) = -1

13b - 4 = -1

13b = 3

b = 3 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 2. Let&#x27;s try c = 3:

13b - 2(3) = -1

13b - 6 = -1

13b = 5

b = 5 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 3. Let&#x27;s try c = 4:

13b - 2(4) = -1

13b - 8 = -1

13b = 7

b = 7 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 4. Let&#x27;s try c = 5:

13b - 2(5) = -1

13b - 10 = -1

13b = 9

b = 9 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 5. Let&#x27;s try c = 6:

13b - 2(6) = -1

13b - 12 = -1

13b = 11

b = 11 / 13

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 6. Let&#x27;s try c = 7:

13b - 2(7) = -1

13b - 14 = -1

13b = 13

b = 13 / 13

b = 1

Now we have found a value for b that is an integer. So, we have a = 1, b = 1, c = 7, and d = 8. Let&#x27;s check if these values satisfy the original equation:

4 × (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a

4 × (1000 × 1 + 100 × 1 + 10 × 7 + 8) = 1000 × 8 + 100 × 7 + 10 × 1 + 1

4 × (1000 + 100 + 70 + 8) = 8000 + 700 + 10 + 1

4 × 1178 = 8711

4712 = 8711

This is not correct, so we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let&#x27;s go back and correct our mistake.

We initially assumed a = 1 and d = 8, which was incorrect. Let&#x27;s try a = 1 and d = 4:

3999a = 3999 × 1 = 3999

996d = 996 × 4 = 3984

Now, we have:

3999 + 390b - 60c - 3984 = 0

15 + 390b - 60c = 0

390b - 60c = -15

Dividing the entire equation by 15, we get:

26b - 4c = -1

Now, we need to find values of b and c that are digits (0-9) and satisfy this equation. Let&#x27;s try c = 1:

26b - 4(1) = -1

26b - 4 = -1

26b = 3

b = 3 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 1. Let&#x27;s try c = 2:

26b - 4(2) = -1

26b - 8 = -1

26b = 7

b = 7 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 2. Let&#x27;s try c = 3:

26b - 4(3) = -1

26b - 12 = -1

26b = 11

b = 11 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 3. Let&#x27;s try c = 4:

26b - 4(4) = -1

26b - 16 = -1

26b = 15

b = 15 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 4. Let&#x27;s try c = 5:

26b - 4(5) = -1

26b - 20 = -1

26b = 19

b = 19 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 5. Let&#x27;s try c = 6:

26b - 4(6) = -1

26b - 24 = -1

26b = 23

b = 23 / 26

Since b must be an integer, c cannot be 6. Let&#x27;s try c = 7:

26b - 4(7) = -1

26b - 28 = -1

26b = 27

b = 27 / 26

b = 1 (since 27 is one more than 26)

Now we have found a value for b that is an integer. So, we have a = 1, b = 1, c = 7, and</code></pre>
