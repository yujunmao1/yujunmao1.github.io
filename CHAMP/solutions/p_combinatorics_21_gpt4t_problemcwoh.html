<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select quadruple (x, y, z, u), with duplicate allowed, such that u&gt;max(x, y, z). In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For u=i, there are i-1 values of x, y and z satisfying u&gt;max(x, y, z), so we have (i-1)^3 triples of valid (x, y, z, u).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^3=sum_(i=1)^n i^3.

Problem: 2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.
Step-wise solution:
1. We can order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n), which can be done in (2n)! ways.
2. The different order of the two players within each pair (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)) result in the same pairing.
3. Thus, we need divide the number of ways by 2^n, since we have n pairs.
4. In addition, the ordering of the pairs also results in duplicate pairing, and there are n! ordering.
5. So in total, we have (2n)!/(2^n*n!) distinct pairings.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select triple (x, y, z), with duplicate allowed, such that z&gt;max(x, y). In how many ways can this be done, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For z=i, there are i-1 values of x and y satisfying z&gt;max(x, y), so we have (i-1)^2 triples of valid (x, y, z).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^2=sum_(i=1)^n i^2.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of distinct colorings of a cube up to rotations. This is a classic problem in combinatorics and group theory, often approached using Burnside&#x27;s Lemma or the Polya Enumeration Theorem. However, for this problem, we can use a simpler approach by considering the symmetries of the cube.

A cube has 6 faces, and each face is painted with a different color. We want to count the number of distinct colorings, considering that rotating the cube does not change the coloring.

The key observation is that any coloring can be transformed into any other coloring by some rotation. This is because we can rotate the cube to put any chosen face on top, and then rotate about the vertical axis to position the surrounding faces as desired.

Since there are 6 faces and each face can be painted with 6 different colors, and each of the remaining 5 faces can be painted with the remaining 5 colors, we start with 6! (factorial) possible colorings.

However, we must account for the rotational symmetries of the cube. The cube can be rotated in several ways that would leave the coloring unchanged:

1. Rotation about an axis through the centers of opposite faces (4 rotations for each face pair, excluding the identity rotation, for 3 pairs of opposite faces).
2. Rotation about an axis through the midpoints of opposite edges (2 rotations for each edge pair, excluding the identity rotation, for 6 pairs of opposite edges).
3. Rotation about an axis through opposite vertices (3 rotations for each vertex pair, excluding the identity rotation, for 4 pairs of opposite vertices).

Now, let&#x27;s count the number of distinct rotations:

- For the first type of rotation (face-to-face), there are 3 axes (pairs of opposite faces), and for each axis, there are 3 non-identity rotations (90°, 180°, and 270°), making 3 * 3 = 9 rotations.
- For the second type of rotation (edge-to-edge), there are 6 axes (pairs of opposite edges), and for each axis, there is 1 non-identity rotation (180°), making 6 * 1 = 6 rotations.
- For the third type of rotation (vertex-to-vertex), there are 4 axes (pairs of opposite vertices), and for each axis, there are 2 non-identity rotations (120° and 240°), making 4 * 2 = 8 rotations.

Including the identity rotation (no rotation), we have a total of 1 + 9 + 6 + 8 = 24 rotations.

Each of these rotations could potentially map a coloring onto itself. However, due to the constraint that all 6 faces are painted with different colors, the only rotation that maps a coloring onto itself is the identity rotation. This is because any non-identity rotation would move at least one face to the position of a differently colored face.

Therefore, the number of distinct colorings up to rotation is simply the total number of colorings divided by the number of rotations in the symmetry group of the cube:

Distinct colorings = 6! / 24 = 720 / 24 = 30.

So there are 30 distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors, one for each face, up to rotations.</code></pre>
