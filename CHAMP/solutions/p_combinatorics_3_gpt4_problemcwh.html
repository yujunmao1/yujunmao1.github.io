<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.
Step-wise solution:
1. For n people, C(n, k) corresponds to the number of possible ways to choose k people, and k^2 correponds to the number of ways to assign two roles, one per person, with one person holding two roles allowed.
2. Thus, we can consider the full expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
3. If the president and the secretary are the same person, we can first choose this person, with n possibilties, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-1 people, with 2^(n-1) possibilities.
4. If the president and the secretary are different people, we can first choose those two, with n(n-1) possibilities, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-2 people, with 2^(n-2) possibilities.
5. Thus, the total number of choices is n*2^(n-1)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=2n*2^(n-2)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=n(n+1)*2^(n-2).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Step-wise solution:

1. If n is odd, the center position must be occupied by a rook. This is because a 180-degree rotation of the board will not change the position of the rook in the center. After placing a rook in the center, we are left with an even number of rooks to place on an (n-1) x (n-1) board, which is invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, the position of another rook on the opposite corner is also determined due to the 180-degree rotation invariance. This means that for every rook placed, two positions are determined. Therefore, we are left with a problem of placing k rooks on a k x k board.

3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Since for every rook placed, two positions are determined, we can express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2). Specifically, P(2k) = k * P(2k-2), because for each of the k rooks, there are k choices for its position.

4. The base case is P(2) = 2, because there are two ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 board such that they are not in the same row or column and the placement is invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

5. Using the recurrence relation and the base case, we can compute P(n) for any given n. For odd n, P(n) = (n-1)/2 * P(n-2). For even n, P(n) = n/2 * P(n-2).

6. Therefore, the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully on an n x n chess board and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation is given by P(n).</code></pre>
