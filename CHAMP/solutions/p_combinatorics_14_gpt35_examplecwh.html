The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s say you have a group of 10 friends and you want to choose a committee of 3 people from this group. The number of ways to choose this committee can be calculated using the concept of combinations.

Using the formula C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to be chosen, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the committee.

In this case, n = 10 (total number of friends) and k = 3 (number of people to be chosen for the committee).

Using the formula, we have:

C(10, 3) = 10! / (3!(10-3)!)
          = 10! / (3!7!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7!) / (3! * 7!)
          = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)
          = 120

Therefore, there are 120 different ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 10 friends.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s say you are organizing a raffle and you have 20 people who have bought tickets. You want to determine the number of ways you can choose a winning ticket from these 20 tickets.

Using the concept of combinations, we can calculate the number of ways to choose the winning ticket using the formula C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items and r is the number of items to be chosen.

In this case, n = 20 (total number of tickets) and r = 1 (number of tickets to be chosen as the winning ticket).

Using the formula, we have:

C(20, 1) = 20! / (1! * (20-1)!)
          = 20! / (1! * 19!)
          = (20 * 19 * 18 * ... * 2 * 1) / (1 * 1)
          = 20

Therefore, there are 20 different ways to choose the winning ticket from a pool of 20 tickets.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let&#x27;s consider the total number of ways to arrange the 8 trees (3 apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees) in a row. Since the apple trees are indistinguishable among themselves and the other trees are also indistinguishable among themselves, we can treat the apple trees as a single entity and the other trees as another single entity.

So, we have 2 entities: the group of apple trees and the group of other trees. We can arrange these 2 entities in a row in (2+1)! = 3! = 6 ways.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the number of ways where at least two apple trees are next to each other. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate this.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways where at least two apple trees are next to each other.

To do this, we can treat the two apple trees that are next to each other as a single entity. So, we have 6 entities: the group of apple trees (treated as a single entity), the group of other trees, and the 4 entities representing the spaces between and at the ends of the trees.

We can arrange these 6 entities in a row in (6+1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.

Step 2: Calculate the number of ways where all three apple trees are next to each other.

In this case, we can treat the three apple trees as a single entity. So, we have 5 entities: the group of three apple trees (treated as a single entity), the group of other trees, and the 3 entities representing the spaces between and at the ends of the trees.

We can arrange these 5 entities in a row in (5+1)! = 6! = 720 ways.

Step 3: Calculate the number of ways where exactly two apple trees are next to each other.

In this case, we have two possibilities: either the first two apple trees are next to each other, or the last two apple trees are next to each other.

For the first case, we can treat the two apple trees as a single entity. So, we have 6 entities: the group of two apple trees (treated as a single entity), the group of other trees, and the 3 entities representing the spaces between and at the ends of the trees.

We can arrange these 6 entities in a row in (6+1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.

For the second case, we can also treat the two apple trees as a single entity. So, we have 6 entities: the group of other trees, the group of two apple trees (treated as a single entity), and the 3 entities representing the spaces between and at the ends of the trees.

We can arrange these 6 entities in a row in (6+1)! = 7! = 5040 ways.

Step 4: Calculate the number of ways where all three apple trees are next to each other.

In this case, we can treat the three apple trees as a single entity. So, we have 5 entities: the group of three apple trees (treated as a single entity), the group of other trees, and the 3 entities representing the spaces between and at the ends of the trees.

We can arrange these 5 entities in a row in (5+1)! = 6! = 720 ways.

Now, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to calculate the number of ways where at least two apple trees are next to each other:

Total number of ways where at least two apple trees are next to each other = Step 1 - Step 2 - Step 3 + Step 4
                                                                      = 5040 - 720 - 5040 + 720
                                                                      = -60

Since the number of ways cannot be negative, we conclude that there are 0 ways where at least two apple trees are next to each other.

Finally, we can calculate the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other by dividing the number of favorable outcomes (0) by the total number of possible outcomes (6):

Probability = 0/6 = 0

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is 0.</code></pre>
