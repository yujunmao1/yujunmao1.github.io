<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, without considering the order in which they are chosen. This is often referred to as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is denoted by C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to be chosen.

The combination formula is given by:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let&#x27;s break down the formula:

- n! is the factorial of the total number of items, which represents the number of ways to arrange all n items in a sequence.
- k! is the factorial of the number of items chosen, which accounts for the fact that the order of selection within the chosen subset does not matter.
- (n - k)! is the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items chosen, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining items that were not chosen.

By dividing n! by the product of k! and (n - k)!, we effectively count each subset of size k exactly once, regardless of the order in which its elements are listed.

For example, if you have a set of 5 items (n = 5) and you want to know how many ways you can choose 2 items (k = 2) from this set, you would calculate it as follows:

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1) * (3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.

So there are 10 different ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5.

The combination formula is widely used in probability theory, statistics, and various fields where the concept of selecting subsets is relevant. It is also closely related to the binomial theorem, which describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} and define a mapping f from these subsets to the subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element (e.g., f({0, 2, 3, 5})={2, 3, 5}).
2. For f(x)=y, where x and y are the two subsets, how many x map to the same y?
3. Relate the number of all possible x to the sum of the smallest element of all possible y.
4. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Let&#x27;s denote this mean by M.

First, let&#x27;s consider the mapping f from subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} to subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element. For a given subset y of {1, ..., n} with r elements, there is exactly one subset x of {0, 1, ..., n} that maps to y, which is obtained by adding the smallest element of y back to y.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the subsets of {1, ..., n} of size r. The smallest element in such a subset can be any number from 1 to n-r+1 (since we need to have enough elements left to complete the subset of size r). For each possible smallest element i, there are C(n-i, r-1) subsets of {1, ..., n} that have i as their smallest element. This is because after choosing i as the smallest element, we need to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the remaining n-i elements.

The sum of the smallest elements of all possible subsets of size r is then given by:

Sum = 1 * C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(n-(n-r+1), r-1)
Sum = ∑ (i * C(n-i, r-1)) for i from 1 to n-r+1

The total number of subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n} is C(n, r).

To find the arithmetic mean M, we divide the sum of the smallest elements by the total number of subsets:

M = Sum / C(n, r)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the sum:

Sum = ∑ (i * C(n-i, r-1)) for i from 1 to n-r+1

We can simplify this sum by recognizing that it resembles the sum of the first (n-r+1) terms of an arithmetic series, but each term is multiplied by a binomial coefficient that decreases as i increases. This is not a standard series sum, and there isn&#x27;t a straightforward formula for it. However, we can make an observation that will help us simplify the problem:

Each element from 1 to n can be the smallest element in a subset of size r exactly C(n-1, r-1) times (by choosing the remaining r-1 elements from the remaining n-1 elements). Therefore, each number from 1 to n-r+1 will appear as the smallest element in C(n-1, r-1) subsets.

Using this observation, we can rewrite the sum as:

Sum = C(n-1, r-1) * (1 + 2 + ... + (n-r+1))

The sum of the first (n-r+1) positive integers is given by the formula:

S = (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2

So, the sum of the smallest elements is:

Sum = C(n-1, r-1) * S
Sum = C(n-1, r-1) * (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2

Now, we can find the mean M:

M = Sum / C(n, r)
M = [C(n-1, r-1) * (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2] / C(n, r)

Using the formula for combinations, we have:

C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!)
C(n-1, r-1) = (n-1)! / ((r-1)!(n-r)!)

Substituting these into the expression for M, we get:

M = [(n-1)! / ((r-1)!(n-r)!)] * (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2 / [n! / (r!(n-r)!)]
M = [(n-1)! / ((r-1)!(n-r)!)] * (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2 / [(n(n-1)! / (r(r-1)!(n-r)!))]

Simplifying, we get:

M = (n-r+1)(n-r+2) / (2r)

This is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n}.</code></pre>
