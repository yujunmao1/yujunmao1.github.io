<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.
Step-wise solution:
1. For n people, C(n, k) corresponds to the number of possible ways to choose k people, and k^2 correponds to the number of ways to assign two roles, one per person, with one person holding two roles allowed.
2. Thus, we can consider the full expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
3. If the president and the secretary are the same person, we can first choose this person, with n possibilties, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-1 people, with 2^(n-1) possibilities.
4. If the president and the secretary are different people, we can first choose those two, with n(n-1) possibilities, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-2 people, with 2^(n-2) possibilities.
5. Thus, the total number of choices is n*2^(n-1)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=2n*2^(n-2)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=n(n+1)*2^(n-2).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the 180-degree rotational invariance. Let&#x27;s break down the solution step by step.

1. If n is odd, the center square of the board must be occupied by a rook. This is because the center square is the only square that maps to itself under a 180-degree rotation. Therefore, for an odd n, there is only one way to place the rook in the center, and we need to consider the placement of the remaining n-1 rooks on an (n-1) x (n-1) board, which is effectively an even-sized board.

2. For even n=2k, if a rook is placed on the first row, the 180-degree rotational invariance requires that another rook must be placed on the corresponding square in the last row. This means that placing a rook on any square in the first row determines the placement of a rook in the last row, and similarly for any other pair of rows that are 180 degrees rotationally symmetric.

3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. To express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2), we consider the placement of rooks on the first and last rows. There are 2k choices for placing a rook on the first row, and this determines the placement of a rook on the last row. After placing these two rooks, we are left with a (2k-2) x (2k-2) board, and we need to place 2k-2 rooks peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation. Therefore, P(2k) = 2k * P(2k-2).

4. For the base case P(2), we have a 2 x 2 board. There are two ways to place two rooks peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation: either place them on the main diagonal or on the off-diagonal. Therefore, P(2) = 2.

Now, let&#x27;s find the number of ways to place n rooks peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation for general n.

For odd n, we have already established that the center square must be occupied by a rook. This leaves us with an even-sized problem of size (n-1) x (n-1), which we can solve using the even case.

For even n=2k, we use the recursive formula P(2k) = 2k * P(2k-2) and the base case P(2) = 2 to find the number of ways.

Let&#x27;s calculate a few values to see the pattern:
- P(2) = 2
- P(4) = 4 * P(2) = 4 * 2 = 8
- P(6) = 6 * P(4) = 6 * 8 = 48
- P(8) = 8 * P(6) = 8 * 48 = 384

The pattern for P(2k) seems to be (2k) * (2k-2) * ... * 4 * 2, which is the double factorial of 2k, denoted as (2k)!!.

Therefore, the number of ways to place n rooks peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation on an n x n chessboard is:
- For odd n: P(n-1) (since the center square is fixed)
- For even n=2k: P(2k) = (2k)!!</code></pre>
