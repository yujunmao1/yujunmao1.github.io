<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and other fields. It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional arithmetic.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, which is equivalent to 5 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, which is equivalent to 0 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus. For example, you can divide 13 by 4 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 4 and 12 are relatively prime. The result of the division is 3. However, you cannot divide 13 by 12 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 12 and 12 are not relatively prime.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. It is the number that the other numbers are &quot;wrapped around&quot; to. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but it is a very powerful tool that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation 2^x-1=3^y.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the equation for xâ‰¥3 by considering the divisibility by 8.
2. Separately consider even and odd values of y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We can solve the equation $2^x-1=3^y$ by considering the divisibility by 8. If $x$ is even, then $2^x$ is divisible by 8. This means that $2^x-1$ is also divisible by 8, and therefore $3^y$ must also be divisible by 8. However, the only positive integer power of 3 that is divisible by 8 is 3^4, which is equal to 81. This means that $y$ must be equal to 4.

If $x$ is odd, then $2^x$ is not divisible by 8. This means that $2^x-1$ is also not divisible by 8, and therefore $3^y$ must also not be divisible by 8. The smallest positive integer power of 3 that is not divisible by 8 is 3^1, which is equal to 3. This means that $y$ must be equal to 1.

Therefore, the only positive integer solutions to the equation $2^x-1=3^y$ are $(x,y)=(2,4)$ and $(x,y)=(1,1)$.

We can also solve the equation $2^x-1=3^y$ by separately considering even and odd values of $y$.

If $y$ is even, then $3^y$ is divisible by 9. This means that $2^x-1$ must also be divisible by 9, and therefore $x$ must be a multiple of 3. The smallest positive integer value of $x$ that satisfies this condition is $x=3$. This gives us the solution $(x,y)=(3,2)$.

If $y$ is odd, then $3^y$ is not divisible by 9. This means that $2^x-1$ must also not be divisible by 9, and therefore $x$ must not be a multiple of 3. The smallest positive integer value of $x$ that satisfies this condition is $x=1$. This gives us the solution $(x,y)=(1,1)$.

Therefore, the only positive integer solutions to the equation $2^x-1=3^y$ are $(x,y)=(3,2)$ and $(x,y)=(1,1)$.</code></pre>
