<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully), as an expression of n.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Place rooks row by row. How many positions are possible for the rook in each row?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board peacefully is $\binom{n(n-1)}{n-1}$.

To see this, we can place the rooks row by row. For the first row, there are $n$ possible positions for the first rook. For the second row, there are $n-1$ possible positions for the second rook, since the first rook cannot be in the same row. For the third row, there are $n-2$ possible positions for the third rook, since the first two rooks cannot be in the same row or column. And so on.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place the rooks is $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots 3\cdot 2\cdot 1 = \frac{n!}{(n-1)!} = \binom{n(n-1)}{n-1}$.

Here is a diagram that shows one possible way to place $4$ rooks on a $4\times 4$ chess board peacefully:
