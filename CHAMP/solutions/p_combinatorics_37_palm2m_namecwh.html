<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of either event A or event B occurring is 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1.

The rule of sum can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of rolling a 6 on a die, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails, or the probability of getting a certain letter on a die.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of sum is only valid if the events are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. For example, the event of rolling a 6 on a die and the event of rolling a 1 on a die are mutually exclusive.

If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is not equal to the sum of the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails. This is because the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is affected by the fact that the coin can land on its edge.

The rule of sum is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select triple (x, y, z), with duplicate allowed, such that z&gt;max(x, y). In how many ways can this be done, as an expression of n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the number of ways to choose the triple when z=i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to choose the triple when $z=i$ is the number of ways to choose two numbers from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, ..., i\\}$, which is $\binom{i+1}{2}$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the triple is

$$\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} \binom{i+1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(n+1)(n+2) = \boxed{\frac{n(n+3)}{2}}.$$

Here is a more detailed solution:

We can choose the triple in the following steps:

1. Choose $z$. There are $n+1$ choices for $z$.
2. Choose $x$. There are $n$ choices for $x$, since $x \leq z$.
3. Choose $y$. There are $n-1$ choices for $y$, since $y \leq z$ and $y \leq x$.

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the triple is $n+1 \cdot n \cdot (n-1) = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$. However, this overcounts the triples where $x=y$ or $y=z$. There are $\binom{n}{2}$ triples where $x=y$ and $\binom{n}{2}$ triples where $y=z$. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the triple is

$$\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} - \binom{n}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2) - 3n(n+1)}{6} = \frac{n(n+3)}{2}.$$</code></pre>
