<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) is a fundamental result in real analysis, particularly in the context of measure theory and integration. It provides conditions under which the limit of a sequence of functions can be integrated by integrating the functions in the sequence. The theorem applies to sequences of real-valued measurable functions that are monotoneâ€”that is, either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Here is the statement of the Monotone Convergence Theorem for non-decreasing sequences of functions:

Let \((f_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions defined on a measure space \((X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)\), such that \(f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)\) for all \(x \in X\) and all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). If \(f_n(x) \to f(x)\) pointwise as \(n \to \infty\) for almost every \(x \in X\), where \(f\) is also a measurable function, then
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
\]

In other words, if you have a sequence of non-negative functions that increase pointwise to some limit function \(f\), then the integral of the limit function \(f\) is the limit of the integrals of the functions in the sequence.

The Monotone Convergence Theorem is particularly useful because it allows us to interchange the limit and the integral, which is not always possible in more general settings. This theorem is a key tool in proving other important results in analysis, such as the Dominated Convergence Theorem and the Fatou&#x27;s Lemma.

It&#x27;s important to note that the Monotone Convergence Theorem requires the functions to be non-negative. This condition ensures that the integrals of the functions in the sequence are well-defined (possibly infinite) and that the sequence of integrals is non-decreasing, which is crucial for the conclusion of the theorem to hold.

The theorem can also be stated for non-increasing sequences of functions, with the appropriate adjustments. In this case, the functions would converge to a non-negative limit function from above, and the theorem would guarantee that the limit of the integrals is equal to the integral of the limit function.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence is defined by a_1=sqrt(2), a_(n+1)=sqrt(2)^a_n. Does the limit for the sequence exist, and if so, find it.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the monotonicity and boundedness of the sequence.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether the sequence \((a_n)\) defined by \(a_1 = \sqrt{2}\) and \(a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n}\) converges, we can investigate its monotonicity and boundedness.

First, let&#x27;s examine the first few terms of the sequence to get an idea of its behavior:

- \(a_1 = \sqrt{2}\)
- \(a_2 = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\)
- \(a_3 = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}}\)

It seems that the sequence is increasing, but we need to prove this. We will show that \(a_n &lt; a_{n+1}\) for all \(n\).

Assume that \(a_n &gt; 1\) for some \(n\). Since the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{2}^x\) is increasing for \(x &gt; 0\) (because the base \(\sqrt{2} &gt; 1\)), we have \(a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n} &gt; \sqrt{2}^1 = \sqrt{2}\). This means that if \(a_n &gt; 1\), then \(a_{n+1} &gt; a_n\). Since \(a_1 = \sqrt{2} &gt; 1\), by induction, we can conclude that the sequence is strictly increasing.

Next, we need to show that the sequence is bounded above. Let&#x27;s assume that the sequence has a limit \(L\). Then, taking the limit on both sides of the recursive definition, we get:

\[
L = \sqrt{2}^L
\]

Taking the logarithm of both sides (with respect to base \(\sqrt{2}\)) gives us:

\[
\log_{\sqrt{2}}(L) = L
\]

This implies:

\[
L = 2^{\log_{\sqrt{2}}(L)/2} = 2^{L/2}
\]

Taking the logarithm again (this time with respect to base 2) gives us:

\[
\log_2(L) = \frac{L}{2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

\[
2\log_2(L) = L
\]

This is a transcendental equation, and it&#x27;s not straightforward to solve algebraically. However, we can use the fact that \(\log_2(L)\) grows much slower than \(L\) as \(L\) increases. This suggests that there is a value of \(L\) that satisfies this equation. In fact, \(L = 2\) is a solution because:

\[
2\log_2(2) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2
\]

So, if the sequence converges, it must converge to \(L = 2\). To show that the sequence is bounded above by 2, we need to prove that \(a_n \leq 2\) for all \(n\). We can do this by induction:

Base case: \(a_1 = \sqrt{2} &lt; 2\).

Inductive step: Assume \(a_n \leq 2\). Since the function \(f(x) = \sqrt{2}^x\) is increasing and \(0 &lt; \sqrt{2} &lt; 2\), we have \(a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n} \leq \sqrt{2}^2 = 2\).

Thus, by induction, the sequence is bounded above by 2.

Since we have shown that the sequence is both strictly increasing and bounded above, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we can conclude that the sequence \((a_n)\) converges. Given the recursive definition and the behavior of the sequence, the limit of the sequence is \(L = 2\).</code></pre>
