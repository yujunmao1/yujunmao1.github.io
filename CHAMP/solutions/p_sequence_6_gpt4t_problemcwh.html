<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let a_n=x_n+y_n+z_n.
2. We have a_2^2=(x_1+1/x_1+y_1+1/y_1+z_1+1/z_1)^2/geq (2+2+2)^2=36=2*18.
3. If a_n^2≥18n, then we have a_(n+1)^2=(x_n+1/x_n+y_n+1/y_n+z_n+1/z_n)^2≥a_n^2+2(x_n+y_n+z_n)(1/x_n+1/y_n+1/z_n)≥a_n^2+2*9≥18n+18=18(n+1).
4. So we have a_n^2≥18n.
5. Thus, a_200^2≥18*200=3600, which means that a_200=x_200+y_200+z_200≥60.
6. So one of x_200, y_200, z_200 must be at least 20.
7. Thus, w_200 cannot be smaller than 20.

Problem: What are possible values of the limit of the sequence x_(n+1)=(x_n+a/x_n)/2, for different values of x_0&gt;0, a&gt;0, possibly as an expression of x_0, a?
Step-wise solution:
1. If a limit exist, it should solve the equation L=(L+a/L)/2, with solution L=±sqrt(a).
2. Since all numbers in the sequence is positive, we take L=sqrt(a).
3. Let e_n=x_n/L-1=x_n/sqrt(a)-1.
4. Thus, e_(n+1)=x_(n+1)/L-1=(x_n+a/x_n)/(2L)-1=(x_n+a/x_n)/(2sqrt(a))-1=(x_n/sqrt(a)+sqrt(a)/x_n)/2-1=(1+e_n+1/(1+e_n))/2-1=(((1+e_n)^2+1)/(1+e_n)-2)/2=e_n/(2(1+e_n)).
5. With this relationship, we see that e_(n+1)≈e_n/2 when e_n is large, and e_(n+1)≈e_n^2/2 when e_n is small.
6. In both cases, e_n approaches 0.
7. Thus, x_n approaches L=sqrt(a).
8. So the limit exists, and is equal to sqrt(a) for all values of x_0, a.

Problem: For x_1, x_2, ..., x_n≥0, with x_1+x_2+...+x_n=1, what is the minimum value of x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let a_1=a_2=...a_n=1 and b_i=x_i.
2. Thus, we have a_1*b_1+a_2*b_2+...+a_n*b_n≤sqrt(a_1^2+a_2^2+...+a_n^2)*sqrt(b_1^2+b_2^2+...+b_n^2).
3. Plugging in the values, we get 1≤sqrt(n)*sqrt(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2).
4. Thus, sqrt(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2)≥1/sqrt(n), and x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2≥1/n.
5. So the smallest value is 1/n, which can be achieved at x_1=x_2=...=x_n=1/n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. At most how many of the three sequences can be bounded?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study the behavior of the three sequences when one is not bounded.
2. To see if all three sequences can be bounded, let a_n=x_n+y_n+z_n.
3. Derive a lower bound on a_2.
4. Compare a_n with 18n for all n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine how many of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} can be bounded, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequences based on the given recursive definitions:

x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n

Let&#x27;s consider the sum a_n = x_n + y_n + z_n as suggested. We will analyze the behavior of a_n to understand the behavior of the individual sequences.

From the previous problems, we have established that:

a_2^2 = (x_1 + 1/x_1 + y_1 + 1/y_1 + z_1 + 1/z_1)^2 ≥ (2 + 2 + 2)^2 = 36 = 2 * 18.

And if a_n^2 ≥ 18n, then:

a_(n+1)^2 = (x_n + 1/x_n + y_n + 1/y_n + z_n + 1/z_n)^2
           ≥ a_n^2 + 2(x_n + y_n + z_n)(1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)
           ≥ a_n^2 + 2 * 9
           ≥ 18n + 18
           = 18(n + 1).

So by induction, we have a_n^2 ≥ 18n for all n.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possibility of the sequences being bounded. If any of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} were bounded, then the sum a_n would also be bounded. However, we have shown that a_n^2 grows at least linearly with n (since a_n^2 ≥ 18n), which implies that a_n itself must grow without bound as n increases.

Since a_n is the sum of the three sequences, if a_n is unbounded, at least one of the sequences must be unbounded. However, the behavior of one sequence affects the others due to their recursive definitions. If one sequence grows without bound, it will cause the subsequent terms of the other sequences to increase as well, due to the addition of the reciprocal of the unbounded term.

For example, if x_n grows without bound, then z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n will also grow without bound because x_n dominates the behavior as n increases. Similarly, y_(n+1) will be affected by the growth of z_n.

Therefore, it is not possible for all three sequences to be bounded. At most, two of the sequences could potentially be bounded if the growth of the third sequence somehow did not affect them significantly. However, given the recursive definitions, the growth of one sequence will influence the others, making it impossible for two sequences to remain bounded while the third grows without bound.

In conclusion, at most one of the three sequences can be bounded, but due to the interdependence of the sequences, in practice, if one sequence is unbounded, it will cause the others to become unbounded as well. Therefore, none of the sequences can be bounded.</code></pre>
