<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The sum and difference of cubes formulas are algebraic identities that express the factoring of the sum or difference of two cube numbers into a product of a binomial and a trinomial. These formulas are useful for factoring expressions, solving equations, and simplifying algebraic expressions involving cubic terms.

The sum of cubes formula is:

a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)

The difference of cubes formula is:

a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

These formulas can be derived by multiplying out the right-hand side and verifying that it simplifies to the left-hand side. Let&#x27;s derive the difference of cubes formula as an example:

(a - b)(a² + ab + b²) = a(a²) + a(ab) + a(b²) - b(a²) - b(ab) - b(b²)
                       = a³ + a²b + ab² - a²b - ab² - b³
                       = a³ - b³

As you can see, the middle terms cancel each other out, leaving us with the original difference of cubes.

Similarly, for the sum of cubes, you can verify the formula by expanding the right-hand side:

(a + b)(a² - ab + b²) = a(a²) - a(ab) + a(b²) + b(a²) - b(ab) + b(b²)
                       = a³ - a²b + ab² + a²b - ab² + b³
                       = a³ + b³

Again, the middle terms cancel each other out, leaving us with the original sum of cubes.

These formulas are particularly useful when you encounter cubic terms that are being added or subtracted and you need to factor them. For example, if you have the expression x³ - 27, you can recognize that 27 is 3³. Using the difference of cubes formula, you can factor this expression as:

x³ - 27 = x³ - 3³ = (x - 3)(x² + 3x + 9)

Similarly, if you have x³ + 8, recognizing that 8 is 2³, you can use the sum of cubes formula to factor it:

x³ + 8 = x³ + 2³ = (x + 2)(x² - 2x + 4)

These identities are very handy in algebra and higher mathematics for simplifying expressions and solving equations involving cubic terms.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To factorize the expression x^9 + x^4 - x - 1 into terms with integer coefficients, we can start by looking for patterns or common factors. However, there are no obvious common factors or simple applications of the sum and difference of cubes formulas here. Instead, we can try to find rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, which states that any rational root of a polynomial with integer coefficients, in the form p/q (where p and q are integers), must have p as a factor of the constant term and q as a factor of the leading coefficient.

For the polynomial x^9 + x^4 - x - 1, the constant term is -1 and the leading coefficient is 1. The only possible rational roots are therefore the factors of -1, which are ±1.

Let&#x27;s check if x = 1 is a root:

(1)^9 + (1)^4 - (1) - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 0

Since x = 1 is a root, (x - 1) is a factor of the polynomial. Now we can perform polynomial long division or synthetic division to divide the polynomial by (x - 1) to find the other factors.

Using synthetic division with x = 1:

```
  1 |  1  0  0  0  1  0  0  0 -1 -1
    |    1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  1
    |_____________________________
      1  1  1  1  2  2  2  2  0  0
```

The quotient we get is x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + 2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x.

Now we have:

x^9 + x^4 - x - 1 = (x - 1)(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5 + 2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x)

The quotient is still a high-degree polynomial, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to factor easily using standard techniques. However, we can look for patterns within the quotient. Notice that the first four terms can be grouped, and the last four terms can also be grouped:

(x^8 + x^7 + x^6 + x^5) + (2x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x)

We can factor out the common factors from each group:

x^5(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) + 2x(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)

Now we see that (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) is a common factor:

(x^5 + 2x)(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)

The factor (x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) doesn&#x27;t have any rational roots (as 1 and -1 do not work), and it doesn&#x27;t factor further with integer coefficients. So, the fully factorized form of the original polynomial with integer coefficients is:

x^9 + x^4 - x - 1 = (x - 1)(x^5 + 2x)(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)

This is the factorization of the given polynomial into terms with integer coefficients.</code></pre>
