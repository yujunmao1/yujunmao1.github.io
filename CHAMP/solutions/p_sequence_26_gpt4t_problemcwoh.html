<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Does the limit exist for the sequence defined by a_0=0, a_(n+1)=sqrt(4+3a_n), and if so, find it.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have a_1=2&gt;a_0.
2. If a_n&gt;a_(n-1), then sqrt(4+3a_n)&gt;sqrt(4+3a_(n-1)), which means that a_(n+1)&gt;a_n.
3. In addition, if a_n&lt;4, then sqrt(4+3a_n)&lt;sqrt(16)=4, so a_(n+1)&lt;4.
4. So the sequence is monotonic and bounded, and thus has a limit.
5. The limit happens when a=sqrt(4+3a), which gives a=4 as the only solution.
6. Thus, the limit of the sequence is 4.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence is defined by a_1=sqrt(2), a_(n+1)=sqrt(2)^a_n. Does the limit for the sequence exist, and if so, find it.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the limit of the sequence exists, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence. Let&#x27;s denote the limit of the sequence as L, assuming it exists. We will follow a similar approach to the one used in the provided solution.

1. We have a_1 = sqrt(2), which is the first term of the sequence.

2. We need to check if the sequence is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing). To do this, we can compare a_n and a_(n+1) for a few terms to see the pattern.

3. We can see that a_2 = sqrt(2)^a_1 = sqrt(2)^sqrt(2) &gt; sqrt(2) = a_1 since raising sqrt(2) to a power greater than 1 will result in a number greater than sqrt(2).

4. Now, let&#x27;s consider a_3 = sqrt(2)^a_2. Since a_2 &gt; 1, we have sqrt(2)^a_2 &gt; sqrt(2)^1 = sqrt(2), so a_3 &gt; a_2.

5. We can conjecture that the sequence is increasing because each term is the result of raising sqrt(2) to a power greater than 1, which is greater than sqrt(2) itself.

6. To prove that the sequence is indeed increasing, we need to show that if a_n &gt; a_(n-1), then a_(n+1) &gt; a_n. Assume a_n &gt; a_(n-1), then since the function f(x) = sqrt(2)^x is increasing for x &gt; 0, we have a_(n+1) = sqrt(2)^a_n &gt; sqrt(2)^a_(n-1) = a_n.

7. Now, we need to check if the sequence is bounded. Since the sequence is increasing, we need to find an upper bound. Notice that as n increases, a_n is the result of an iterated exponential function with base sqrt(2), which grows very slowly. It&#x27;s not immediately clear what the upper bound is, so we will assume the sequence is bounded above and proceed to find the limit.

8. Assuming the limit L exists, we can write the limit equation based on the recursive definition of the sequence:
   L = sqrt(2)^L

9. To solve for L, we can take the logarithm of both sides:
   log(L) = L * log(sqrt(2))

10. Since log(sqrt(2)) is a positive constant, we can denote it as c, where c = log(sqrt(2)) &gt; 0. Then we have:
    log(L) = L * c

11. If L were greater than 0, then L * c would be greater than log(L) because c &gt; 0 and L &gt; 1 would imply that L is growing faster than log(L). This would contradict our equation. Therefore, the only possibility is that L = 0.

12. We can verify this by substituting L = 0 into the limit equation:
    0 = sqrt(2)^0
    0 = 1

This is a contradiction because 0 does not equal 1. Therefore, our assumption that the sequence is bounded and has a limit must be incorrect.

Conclusion:
The sequence defined by a_1 = sqrt(2), a_(n+1) = sqrt(2)^a_n does not have a limit because it is increasing and not bounded above. The terms of the sequence grow without bound as n increases.</code></pre>
