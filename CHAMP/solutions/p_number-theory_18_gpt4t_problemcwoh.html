<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find all integer solutions to the equation 15x^2-7y^2=9.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 7y^2=15x^2-9 is a multiple of 3, y must be a multiple of 3.
2. Define y=3u, and we have 15x^2-63u^2=9.
3. Thus, 5x^2=21u^2+3, which means that x is a also multiple of 3.
4. Define x=3v and we have 45v^2=21u^2+3, and get 15v^2-1=7u^2.
5. Since 7u^2 mod 3=15v^2-1 mod 3=2, u^2 mod 3=2.
6. However, for any integer u, u^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1.
7. Thus, the original equation has no integer solution.

Problem: Are there integer solutions to the equation (x^2-1)(y^2-1)+1981=z^2?
Step-wise solution:
1. If the equation has a solution, we have (x^2-1)(y^2-1)=z^2-1981.
2. Since u^2 mod 8∈{0, 1, 4}, we have u^2-1 mod 8∈{0, 3, 7} and (x^2-1)(y^2-1) mod 8∈{0, 1, 5}.
3. However, since 1981 mod 8=5, z^2-1981 mod 8∈{3, 4, 7}.
4. Since there is no overlapping values, we conclude that the equation has no solution.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation x^2-3y^2=17.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all integer solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \), we can use a similar approach to the one used in the first problem. Let&#x27;s proceed step by step:

1. We are looking for integer solutions, so we can rewrite the equation as \( x^2 = 3y^2 + 17 \).

2. Notice that \( x^2 \) must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3 because the square of any integer is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3. This means that the right-hand side, \( 3y^2 + 17 \), must also be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.

3. Since \( 3y^2 \) is clearly a multiple of 3, we only need to consider the congruence of 17 modulo 3. We have \( 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).

4. Therefore, \( 3y^2 + 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). This means that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), which is impossible because, as stated earlier, \( x^2 \) can only be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3.

5. However, we made an error in step 4. The correct congruence should be \( 3y^2 + 17 \equiv 2 + 0 \pmod{3} \), which simplifies to \( 3y^2 + 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). But since \( 3y^2 \) is always congruent to 0 modulo 3, we actually have \( 3y^2 + 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), which is consistent with \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \). Therefore, \( x^2 \) can indeed be congruent to 2 modulo 3, and our initial conclusion was incorrect.

6. We need to find integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^2 = 3y^2 + 17 \). This is a Pell-like equation, and we can look for solutions by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \).

7. We can start by testing small values of \( y \) and checking if \( x^2 = 3y^2 + 17 \) yields a perfect square for \( x \).

8. For \( y = 0 \), we get \( x^2 = 17 \), which is not a perfect square.

9. For \( y = 1 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(1)^2 + 17 = 3 + 17 = 20 \), which is not a perfect square.

10. For \( y = 2 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(2)^2 + 17 = 12 + 17 = 29 \), which is not a perfect square.

11. For \( y = 3 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(3)^2 + 17 = 27 + 17 = 44 \), which is not a perfect square.

12. For \( y = 4 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(4)^2 + 17 = 48 + 17 = 65 \), which is not a perfect square.

13. For \( y = 5 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(5)^2 + 17 = 75 + 17 = 92 \), which is not a perfect square.

14. For \( y = 6 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(6)^2 + 17 = 108 + 17 = 125 \), which is not a perfect square.

15. For \( y = 7 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(7)^2 + 17 = 147 + 17 = 164 \), which is not a perfect square.

16. For \( y = 8 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(8)^2 + 17 = 192 + 17 = 209 \), which is not a perfect square.

17. For \( y = 9 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(9)^2 + 17 = 243 + 17 = 260 \), which is not a perfect square.

18. For \( y = 10 \), we get \( x^2 = 3(10)^2 + 17 = 300 + 17 = 317 \), which is not a perfect square.

19. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that this trial-and-error method is inefficient. Instead, we can use the theory of Pell&#x27;s equation to find solutions systematically.

20. The equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \) is similar to Pell&#x27;s equation \( x^2 - Dy^2 = 1 \), where \( D \) is a non-square positive integer. In our case, \( D = 3 \) and the right-hand side is 17 instead of 1.

21. The fundamental solution to the equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 \) is \( (x, y) = (2, 1) \), since \( 2^2 - 3(1)^2 = 1 \).

22. However, we are looking for solutions to \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \), so we need to find a way to relate this to the fundamental solution.

23. We can look for solutions of the form \( (x + \sqrt{3}y)(2 + \sqrt{3})^n \), where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. This is because the powers of \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) generate solutions to the related Pell&#x27;s equation.

24. We can use a computer or a systematic search to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( (x + \sqrt{3}y)(2 + \sqrt{3})^n \) yields a solution to our original equation.

25. After finding the smallest solution, we can generate more solutions by raising \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) to higher powers and multiplying it by the smallest solution.

Let&#x27;s find the smallest solution by testing values of \( n \):

For \( n = 0 \), we have \( (x, y) = (1, 0) \), which gives \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 \), not 17.

For \( n = 1 \), we have \( (x, y) = (2, 1) \), which gives \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 \), not 17.

We need to find the correct \( n \) such that \( (x + \sqrt{3}y)(2 + \sqrt{3})^n \) gives us the right-hand side of 17. This can be done by expanding the product and equating the coefficients of the resulting expression to 17.

Let&#x27;s try \( n = 2 \):

\( (x + \sqrt{3}y)(2 + \sqrt{3})^2 = (x + \sqrt{3}y)(7 + 4\sqrt{3}) \)

We want the coefficient of the square root to be zero and the constant term to be 17. Expanding the product, we get:

\( (x \cdot 7 + 3y \cdot 4) + (x \cdot 4 + y \cdot 7)\sqrt{3} \)

Setting the square root coefficient to zero gives us:

\( x \cdot 4 + y \cdot 7 = 0 \)

This equation does not have integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) that also satisfy the constant term being 17. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is not the correct exponent.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a more systematic approach to find the smallest solution. One way to do this is to use the continued fraction expansion of \( \sqrt{3} \) to find the convergents that give us the Pell-like equation solutions.

The continued fraction expansion of \( \sqrt{3} \) is periodic and has the form:

\[ \sqrt{3} = [1; \overline{1, 2}] \]

The convergents of this continued fraction give us the solutions to the Pell&#x27;s equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 \). We can use these convergents to find solutions to our original equation by looking for a convergent that, when squared, gives us a number close to 17.

Let&#x27;s find the first few convergents:

The first few convergents of \( \sqrt{3} \) are:

\[ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{5}{3}, \frac{7}{4}, \frac{19}{11}, \frac{26}{15}, \ldots \]

We can test these convergents to see if they give us a solution to the equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 \).

For the convergent \( \frac{5}{3} \), we have \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 3 \), which gives us:

\[ 5^2 - 3 \cdot 3^2 = 25 - 27 = -2 \]

This is not a solution.

For the convergent \( \frac{7}{4} \), we have \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 4 \), which gives us:

\[ 7^2 - 3 \cdot 4^2 = 49 - 48 = 1 \]

This is not a solution.

For the convergent \( \frac{19}{11} \), we have \( x = 19 \) and \( y = 11 \), which gives us:

\[ 19^2 - 3 \cdot 11^2 = 361 - 363 = -2 \]

This is not a solution.

For the convergent \( \frac{26}{15} \), we have \( x = 26 \) and \( y = 15 \), which gives us:

\[ 26^2 - 3 \cdot 15^2 = 676 - 675 = 1 \]

This is not a solution.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need to find a convergent that, when squared, gives us a number close to 17. This can be done by looking at the sequence of convergents and finding the appropriate one.

However, we can also use a different approach by considering the norm of the algebraic integers in the quadratic field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \). The norm of \( x + y\sqrt{3} \) is given by \( x^2 - 3y^2 \). We want to find \( (x, y) \) such that the norm is 17.

We can look for elements in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3}) \) that have a norm of 17. This can be done by considering the multiplication of elements with known norms. For example, if we have two elements with norms \( a \) and \( b \), their product will have a norm of \( ab \).

Since we know that \( (2, 1) \) is a solution to the Pell&#x27;s equation \( x^2 - 3y^2 = 1 \), we can look for an element with a norm of 17 and multiply it by \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) to find a solution to our original equation.

Let&#x27;s consider the element \( 4 + \sqrt{3} \). Its norm is \( 4^2 - 3 \cdot 1^2 = 16 - 3 = 13 \). This is not 17, but it&#x27;s close.

We can multiply \( (4 + \sqrt{3}) \) by \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) to see if we get a norm of 17:

\[ (4 + \sqrt{3})(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 8 + 4\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} + 3 = 11 + 6\sqrt{3} \]

The norm of \( 11 + 6\sqrt{3} \) is \( 11^2 - 3 \cdot 6^2 = 121 - 108 = 13 \), which is not 17.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need to find the right element to multiply by \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) to get a norm of 17.

Let&#x27;s try the element \( 5 + \sqrt{3} \). Its norm is \( 5^2 - 3 \cdot 1^2 = 25 - 3 = 22 \). This is not 17, but it&#x27;s close.

We can multiply \( (5 + \sqrt{3}) \) by \( (2 + \sqrt{3}) \) to see if we get a norm of 17:

\[ (5 + \sqrt{3})(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 10 + 5\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{3} + 3 = 13 + 7\sqrt{3} \]

The norm of \( 13 + 7\sqrt{3} \) is \( 13^2 - 3 \cdot 7^2 = 169 - 147 = 22 \), which is not 17.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need to find the right element to multiply by \( (2 + \sqrt{3})</code></pre>
