<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) is a fundamental result in real analysis, particularly in the context of measure theory and integration. It provides conditions under which the limit of a sequence of functions can be integrated by integrating the functions in the sequence. The theorem applies to sequences of real-valued measurable functions that are monotone—that is, either non-decreasing or non-increasing.

Here is the statement of the Monotone Convergence Theorem for non-decreasing sequences of functions:

Let \((f_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence of non-negative measurable functions defined on a measure space \((X, \mathcal{M}, \mu)\), such that \(f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)\) for all \(x \in X\) and all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). If \(f_n(x) \to f(x)\) pointwise as \(n \to \infty\) for almost every \(x \in X\), where \(f\) is also a measurable function, then
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \int_X f_n \, d\mu = \int_X f \, d\mu.
\]

In other words, if you have a sequence of non-negative functions that increase pointwise to some limit function \(f\), then the integral of the limit function \(f\) is the limit of the integrals of the functions in the sequence.

The Monotone Convergence Theorem is particularly useful because it allows us to interchange the limit and the integral, which is not always possible in more general settings. This theorem is a key tool in proving other important results in analysis, such as the Dominated Convergence Theorem and the Fatou&#x27;s Lemma.

It&#x27;s important to note that the Monotone Convergence Theorem requires the functions to be non-negative. This condition ensures that the integrals of the functions in the sequence are well-defined (possibly infinite) and that the sequence of integrals is non-decreasing, which is crucial for the conclusion of the theorem to hold.

The theorem can also be stated for non-increasing sequences of functions, with the appropriate adjustments. In this case, the functions would converge to a non-negative limit function from above, and the theorem would guarantee that the limit of the integrals is equal to the integral of the limit function.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Does the limit exist for the sequence defined by a_0=0, a_(n+1)=sqrt(6+a_n), and if so, find it.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether the limit exists for the sequence defined by \(a_0 = 0\) and \(a_{n+1} = \sqrt{6 + a_n}\), we can first investigate the behavior of the sequence.

Let&#x27;s start by computing the first few terms of the sequence to get a sense of its behavior:

- \(a_0 = 0\)
- \(a_1 = \sqrt{6 + a_0} = \sqrt{6 + 0} = \sqrt{6}\)
- \(a_2 = \sqrt{6 + a_1} = \sqrt{6 + \sqrt{6}}\)
- \(a_3 = \sqrt{6 + a_2} = \sqrt{6 + \sqrt{6 + \sqrt{6}}}\)

We can see that each term is non-negative and that the sequence is increasing because we are always adding a positive quantity inside the square root. By the property of square roots given in the problem statement, if \(a_n \leq a_{n+1}\), then \(\sqrt{6 + a_n} \leq \sqrt{6 + a_{n+1}}\), which means \(a_{n+1} \leq a_{n+2}\). Since \(a_0 = 0\), it follows by induction that \(a_n \leq a_{n+1}\) for all \(n\), and thus the sequence is non-decreasing.

Now, let&#x27;s show that the sequence is bounded above. Suppose the sequence has a limit \(L\). Then, taking the limit on both sides of the recursive definition, we get:

\[
L = \sqrt{6 + L}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives us:

\[
L^2 = 6 + L
\]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:

\[
L^2 - L - 6 = 0
\]

Factoring the quadratic, we find:

\[
(L - 3)(L + 2) = 0
\]

This gives us two potential solutions for \(L\), namely \(L = 3\) and \(L = -2\). However, since the sequence consists of non-negative terms, the only feasible limit is \(L = 3\).

To confirm that \(L = 3\) is indeed the limit, we need to show that the sequence is bounded above by 3. We can prove this by induction. We have already established that \(a_0 = 0\), which is less than 3. Now, assume that \(a_n \leq 3\) for some \(n\). Then:

\[
a_{n+1} = \sqrt{6 + a_n} \leq \sqrt{6 + 3} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

So by induction, \(a_n \leq 3\) for all \(n\).

Since the sequence \((a_n)\) is non-decreasing and bounded above by 3, it must converge to some limit by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. We have already shown that if a limit \(L\) exists, it must satisfy \(L = 3\). Therefore, the limit of the sequence exists and is equal to 3.</code></pre>
