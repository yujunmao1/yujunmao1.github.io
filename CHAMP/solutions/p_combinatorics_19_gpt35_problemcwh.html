<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. For a convex polygon of n vertices, we draw all possible diagonals and suppose that no three diagonals pass through the same point. How many such intersection points do we have in the interior of the polygon, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Every intersection point is created by two diagnoals constructed from a set of four vertex points, and every set of four vertex points creates exactly two diagonals that have exactly one intersection point.
2. Thus, the number of intersection points is the number of four-vertex-set from the n vertices, which is C(n, 4).

Problem: 2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.
Step-wise solution:
1. We can order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n), which can be done in (2n)! ways.
2. The different order of the two players within each pair (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)) result in the same pairing.
3. Thus, we need divide the number of ways by 2^n, since we have n pairs.
4. In addition, the ordering of the pairs also results in duplicate pairing, and there are n! ordering.
5. So in total, we have (2n)!/(2^n*n!) distinct pairings.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
2. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are the same person, by first selecting the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number).
3. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are different people, by first selecting the president, then the secretary, and finally the rest of the committee (of any number).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find a closed-form formula for the sum, we can use the information provided and apply combinatorial reasoning.

1. Interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of ways to choose a committee of size k from n people as C(n, k). Then, the expression C(n, k)*k^2 represents the number of ways to choose a committee of size k and select a president and a secretary from that committee.

2. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are the same person, by first selecting the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number).

If the president and the secretary are the same person, we first need to select the president from the n people, which can be done in n ways. Then, we need to choose the remaining committee members from the remaining n-1 people, which can be done in C(n-1, k-1) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to select such a committee is n * C(n-1, k-1).

3. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are different people, by first selecting the president, then the secretary, and finally the rest of the committee (of any number).

If the president and the secretary are different people, we first need to select the president from the n people, which can be done in n ways. Then, we need to choose the secretary from the remaining n-1 people, which can be done in n-1 ways. Finally, we need to choose the remaining committee members from the remaining n-2 people, which can be done in C(n-2, k-2) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to select such a committee is n * (n-1) * C(n-2, k-2).

Now, let&#x27;s express the given sum in terms of these two cases:

sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2 = sum_(k=1)^n (n * C(n-1, k-1) + n * (n-1) * C(n-2, k-2)) * k

We can split the sum into two parts:

Part 1: sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, k-1) * k^2
Part 2: sum_(k=1)^n n * (n-1) * C(n-2, k-2) * k

For Part 1, we can use the identity C(n-1, k-1) = C(n-1, n-k) to rewrite it as:

sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, n-k) * k^2

Now, let&#x27;s make a change of variable by letting j = n-k:

sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, j) * (n-j)^2

We can further simplify this expression by using the identity C(n-1, j) = C(n-1, n-1-j):

sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, n-1-j) * (n-j)^2

This sum can be recognized as the expansion of (n-j)^2 in terms of binomial coefficients. By the binomial theorem, we know that:

(n-j)^2 = sum_(i=0)^(n-1) C(n-1, i) * (-j)^i

Therefore, we can rewrite Part 1 as:

sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, n-1-j) * (n-j)^2 = sum_(k=1)^n n * sum_(i=0)^(n-1) C(n-1, i) * (-j)^i

Now, we can interchange the order of summation:

sum_(k=1)^n n * sum_(i=0)^(n-1) C(n-1, i) * (-j)^i = sum_(i=0)^(n-1) sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, i) * (-j)^i

The inner sum, sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, i), is simply n times the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n-1, i) over all i, which is equal to 2^(n-1) by the binomial theorem.

Therefore, the inner sum simplifies to:

sum_(k=1)^n n * C(n-1, i) = n * 2^(n-1)

Substituting this back into the expression, we have:

sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2 = sum_(i=0)^(n-1) n * 2^(n-1) * (-j)^i

Now, let&#x27;s simplify Part 2:

sum_(k=1)^n n * (n-1) * C(n-2, k-2) * k = n * (n-1) * sum_(k=1)^n C(n-2, k-2) * k

This sum can be recognized as the expansion of k in terms of binomial coefficients. By the binomial theorem, we know that:

k = sum_(i=0)^(n-2) C(n-2, i)

Therefore, we can rewrite Part 2 as:

n * (n-1) * sum_(k=1)^n C(n-2, k-2) * k = n * (n-1) * sum_(i=0)^(n-2) C(n-2, i)

The inner sum, sum_(i=0)^(n-2) C(n-2, i), is simply the sum of the binomial coefficients C(n-2, i) over all i, which is equal to 2^(n-2) by the binomial theorem.

Therefore, the inner sum simplifies to:

sum_(i=0)^(n-2) C(n-2, i) = 2^(n-2)

Substituting this back into the expression, we have:

sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2 = n * 2^(n-1) + n * (n-1) * 2^(n-2)

Now, let&#x27;s simplify this expression further:

sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2 = n * 2^(n-1) + n * (n-1) * 2^(n-2)
                           = n * 2^(n-1) + n * (n-1) * 2^(n-2)
                           = n * 2^(n-1) + n * 2^(n-1)
                           = 2n * 2^(n-1) + n * 2^(n-1)
                           = (2n + n) * 2^(n-1)
                           = 3n * 2^(n-1)
                           = 3n * 2^n/2
                           = 3n * 2^(n-1)
                           = 3n * 2^n

Therefore, the closed-form formula for the sum is 3n * 2^n.</code></pre>
