<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n \) and contain the number \( k \) at least once, where \( k &lt; n - 1 \).

Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that sums to \( n \) and contains the number \( k \). If we remove \( k \) from this sequence, we are left with a sequence of positive integers that sums to \( n - k \). The problem now reduces to counting the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n - k \).

The number of sequences of positive integers that sum to a given number is equivalent to the number of ways to partition that number. This is a well-known problem in combinatorics, and the number of partitions of an integer is a complex topic. However, we can use stars and bars (a combinatorial method) to count the number of ways to sum to \( n - k \) with positive integers.

Using the stars and bars method, we imagine \( n - k \) stars in a row, and we need to place bars between them to create groups (the numbers in our sequence). Since we are dealing with positive integers, we need to place \( m - 1 \) bars to create \( m \) groups, where \( m \) is the number of positive integers in our new sequence.

The number of places to put the bars is \( (n - k - 1) \), and we need to choose \( m - 1 \) of these places. However, since \( m \) can range from 1 to \( n - k \), we need to sum over all possible values of \( m \).

The number of ways to place \( m - 1 \) bars among \( n - k - 1 \) spots is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n - k - 1}{m - 1} \). Summing over all possible \( m \), we get:

\[ \sum_{m=1}^{n-k} \binom{n - k - 1}{m - 1} \]

This sum actually simplifies to \( 2^{n - k - 1} \), because it represents the sum of all the terms in the expansion of \( (1 + 1)^{n - k - 1} \) by the binomial theorem.

However, we must remember that this count includes the number \( k \) exactly once in each sequence. If we want to count the total number of times \( k \) appears across all sequences, we need to consider that \( k \) can appear more than once in a sequence.

To account for multiple occurrences of \( k \), we can repeat the above process for sequences that sum to \( n - 2k \), \( n - 3k \), and so on, until we reach a sum that is less than \( k \) (since we cannot have a positive integer less than 1 in our sequence).

The total count of occurrences of \( k \) is then:

\[ \sum_{i=1}^{\lfloor \frac{n}{k} \rfloor - 1} 2^{n - ik - 1} \]

This sum accounts for all sequences where \( k \) appears exactly \( i \) times, for \( i \) ranging from 1 to the largest integer less than \( \frac{n}{k} \).

This is the final expression for the number of times \( k \) appears in all sequences of positive integers that sum to \( n \), given \( k &lt; n - 1 \).</code></pre>
