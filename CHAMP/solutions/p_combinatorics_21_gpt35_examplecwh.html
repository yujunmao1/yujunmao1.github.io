<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich. Suppose we have 3 steps involved in making a sandwich: choosing the type of bread, selecting the filling, and adding toppings. 

Let&#x27;s say there are 2 options for the type of bread (p1 = 2), 3 options for the filling (p2 = 3), and 4 options for the toppings (p3 = 4). 

According to the concept you mentioned, the total number of ways to make a sandwich would be p1 * p2 * p3 = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to make a sandwich by considering all the possible combinations of bread, filling, and toppings.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a scenario where we have a jar filled with marbles. We want to determine the number of marbles in the jar, but we can only count a few marbles at a time due to their small size.

Suppose we count the marbles in groups of 5 and obtain a total count of 30 marbles. According to the concept you mentioned, we can calculate the number of marbles in the jar by dividing the total count by the number of times we counted each object.

In this case, we counted each marble 5 times (d = 5) and obtained a total count of 30 (n = 30). Therefore, the number of marbles in the jar would be n/d = 30/5 = 6.

Hence, there are 6 marbles in the jar based on the given information.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a scenario where we have a set of 3 tasks to complete: Task A, Task B, and Task C. Each task has a certain number of ways it can be performed.

Suppose Task A can be performed in 2 ways (p1 = 2), Task B can be performed in 3 ways (p2 = 3), and Task C can be performed in 4 ways (p3 = 4).

According to the concept you mentioned, if no two tasks can be performed simultaneously, the total number of ways to perform the tasks would be the sum of the ways each task can be performed.

In this case, the total number of ways to perform the tasks would be p1 + p2 + p3 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

Hence, there are 9 different ways to perform the tasks A, B, and C, considering all the possible combinations of performing each task individually.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s consider the different cases mentioned:

Case 1: Second face on top
If we paint the second face on top, we have 5 remaining faces to paint. Since the bottom face is already painted, we have 5 choices for the top face. After painting the top face, we have 4 remaining faces to paint. For each of these 4 faces, we have 3 choices of color (as we cannot use the color of the top or bottom face). Therefore, the number of distinct colorings in this case is 5 * 3^4 = 405.

Case 2: Second face on the side
If we paint the second face on the side, we have 5 remaining faces to paint. For each of these 5 faces, we have 4 choices of color (as we cannot use the color of the top or bottom face, and the side face cannot have the same color as the opposite side). After painting the second face, we have 4 remaining faces to paint. For each of these 4 faces, we have 3 choices of color. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings in this case is 5 * 4 * 3^3 = 540.

Now, to find the total number of distinct colorings up to rotations, we need to consider both cases:

Total number of distinct colorings = Case 1 + Case 2 = 405 + 540 = 945.

Therefore, there are 945 distinct colorings up to rotations for the faces of the cube.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 945 distinct colorings up to rotations for the faces of the cube, where each face is painted with a different color.</code></pre>
