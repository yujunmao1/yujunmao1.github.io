The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a deck of 52 cards. You want to choose a hand of 5 cards. The number of ways to do this is $C(52, 5) = 2,598,960$.

Another example is if you have a group of 10 people and you want to choose a committee of 3 people. The number of ways to do this is $C(10, 3) = 120$.

In general, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is given by the formula $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$ and $k!$ is the factorial of $k$.

The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, $5! = 120$ because $120 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$.

The formula for $C(n, k)$ can be derived using the following argument. Let&#x27;s say we want to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items. We can do this by first choosing the first item, then the second item, and so on until we have chosen $k$ items. There are $n$ choices for the first item, $n-1$ choices for the second item, and so on. So, the total number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.

However, this overcounts the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items, because it doesn&#x27;t take into account the order in which we choose the items. For example, the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is the same set as the set $\\{3, 2, 1\\}$. So, we need to divide the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items by the number of ways to order $k$ items. The number of ways to order $k$ items is $k!$. So, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) buy the paint, (2) mix the paint, and (3) paint the walls. There are 5 different stores where you can buy the paint, 3 different ways to mix the paint, and 2 different colors you can paint the walls. So, there are $5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30$ ways to paint the room.

Another example is if you want to choose a 4-digit PIN code. There are 10 digits to choose from, so there are $10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10000$ possible PIN codes.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The total number of ways to choose 3 children to give toys to is $10C_3 = 120$.

The number of ways to choose 3 children with no boys is $6C_3 = 20$.

So, the number of ways to choose 3 children with at least 2 boys is $120 - 20 = 100$.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. We can choose 2 boys and 1 girl in $4C_2 \cdot 6C_1 = 60$ ways.
2. We can choose 3 boys in $4C_3 = 4$ ways.
3. So, the number of ways to choose 3 children with at least 2 boys is $60 + 4 = 64$.

However, this overcounts the number of ways, because we have counted the cases where we choose 2 boys and 1 girl twice. For example, the case where we choose boy 1, girl 1, and boy 2 is the same as the case where we choose boy 2, girl 1, and boy 1.

To account for this overcounting, we need to divide the number of ways we can choose 2 boys and 1 girl by 2.

So, the number of ways to choose 3 children with at least 2 boys is $60 + 4 - \frac{60}{2} = 100$.</code></pre>
