<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let A be a string of n binary digits (leading 0s are allowed). How many such strings have the substring &quot;01&quot; appearing exactly m times, as an expression of m and n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the string, we add 1 to the front and 0 to the back, and consider the n+1 gaps between the n+2 digits.
2. For the two digits around the gap, if they are &quot;01&quot;, we call the gap a &quot;0-1&quot; transition, and analogously a &quot;1-0&quot; transition, or neither.
3. We note that prepending with 1 and appending with 0 does not create new 01 substrings, or in other words &quot;0-1&quot; transitions.
4. Thus, there are m &quot;0-1&quot; transitions.
5. Since &quot;0-1&quot; transitions must interleave with &quot;1-0&quot; transitions, and the first and last transitions are &quot;1-0&quot; transitions (because we add 1 and 0 to the front and back), we have m+1 &quot;1-0&quot; transitions.
6. Thus, among n+1 gaps, we need to choose 2m+1 of them to insert these 2m+1 transitions, and each choice of 2m+1 gaps leads to one unique set of (alternating) transitions, which corresponds to one string with m &quot;01&quot; substrings.
7. So the total number of such strings is C(n+1, 2m+1).

Problem: In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let H(n, r) represent the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups (where horses in each group are tied).
2. We have H(n, 1)=1 for all n, since there is only one way that all groups are tied.
3. To calculate H(n, r), we add a new horse to the race result of n-1 horses.
4. The new horse can be in its own finishing group, in which case we require that there are r-1 finishing groups originally.
5. For each race result in H(n-1, r-1), the new horse can be inserted into one of r slots (first, in between two groups and last), so we have H(n-1, r-1)*r groups.
6. The new horse can also be in a tied position, in which case we require that there are r finishing groups originally.
7. For each race result in H(n-1, r), the new horse can be tied in one of r groups, so we have H(n-1, r)*r groups.
8. Adding these two ways together, we have H(n, r)=(H(n-1, r-1)+H(n-1, r))*r, with H(a, b)=0 for b&gt;a (because the number of finishing groups cannot be larger than the number of horses).
9. Thus, the number of ways that n horses can finish is P(n)=H(n, 1)+H(n, 2)+...+H(n, n).
10. Plugging in the numbers, we get: H(1, 1)=1, H(2, 1)=1, H(2, 2)=2, H(3, 1)=1, H(3, 2)=6, H(3, 3)=6, H(4, 1)=1, H(4, 2)=14, H(4, 3)=36, H(4, 4)=24.
11. So P(4)=1+14+36+24=75.

Problem: For positive integers a, b, c, d, e satisfying a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25=0, what are possible values of abcde mod 5?
Step-wise solution:
1. If 5 ∤ abcde, then none of a, b, c, d, e is divisible by 5.
2. For 5 ∤ u, we have u=5k±1 or u=5k±2.
3. For u=5k±1, u^5=(5k±1)^5=(5k)^5±5*(5k)^4+10*(5k)^3±10*(5k)^2+5*(5k)±1, and u^5 mod 25=±1.
4. For u=5k±2, u^5=(5k±2)^5=(5k)^5±5*(5k)^4*2+10*(5k)^3*4±10*(5k)^2*8+5*(5k)*16±32, and u^5 mod 25=±7.
5. Thus, in a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25, each u^5 contributes ±1 or ±7.
6. No addition of five of these numbers result in a multiple of 25.
7. Thus, 25 ∤ a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5.
8. This means that if a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25=0, we must have abcde mod 5=0.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations.

Step-wise solution:
1. Let&#x27;s consider the number of 1s in the string. We need to find the number of strings with an even number of 1s.
2. We can have 0, 2, 4, 6, ..., or n 1s in the string.
3. If we have 0 1s, then we can choose any of the remaining three digits (2, 3, or 4) for each position in the string. So, there is 1 way to have 0 1s.
4. If we have 2 1s, then we need to choose 2 positions out of n for the 1s. The remaining n-2 positions can be filled with any of the remaining three digits. So, the number of ways to have 2 1s is given by C(n, 2) * 3^(n-2).
5. Similarly, if we have 4 1s, then we need to choose 4 positions out of n for the 1s. The remaining n-4 positions can be filled with any of the remaining three digits. So, the number of ways to have 4 1s is given by C(n, 4) * 3^(n-4).
6. Continuing this pattern, if we have an even number of 1s, we need to choose an even number of positions out of n for the 1s. The remaining positions can be filled with any of the remaining three digits. So, the number of ways to have an even number of 1s is given by the sum of C(n, 0) * 3^n + C(n, 2) * 3^(n-2) + C(n, 4) * 3^(n-4) + ... + C(n, n) * 3^0.
7. Using the binomial theorem, we know that (x + y)^n = C(n, 0) * x^n * y^0 + C(n, 1) * x^(n-1) * y^1 + C(n, 2) * x^(n-2) * y^2 + ... + C(n, n) * x^0 * y^n.
8. In our case, x = 1 and y = 3. So, we can rewrite the expression from step 6 as (1 + 3)^n.
9. Using the binomial theorem again, we know that (1 + 3)^n = C(n, 0) * 1^n * 3^0 + C(n, 1) * 1^(n-1) * 3^1 + C(n, 2) * 1^(n-2) * 3^2 + ... + C(n, n) * 1^0 * 3^n.
10. Simplifying this expression, we get (1 + 3)^n = C(n, 0) + C(n, 1) * 3 + C(n, 2) * 3^2 + ... + C(n, n) * 3^n.
11. Comparing this with the expression from step 6, we can see that the number of ways to have an even number of 1s is equal to (1 + 3)^n.
12. Finally, we can simplify (1 + 3)^n to 4^n.
13. Therefore, the number of strings of length n consisting of digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have an even number of 1s is 4^n.

So, the final answer is 4^n.</code></pre>
