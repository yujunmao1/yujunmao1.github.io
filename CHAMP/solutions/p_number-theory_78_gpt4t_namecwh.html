<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
In other words, you can add the remainders of two numbers and the sum will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
Similar to addition, you can subtract the remainders of two numbers and the difference will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
When you multiply two numbers, you can multiply their remainders to get the remainder of the product when divided by the modulus.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You cannot simply divide the remainders unless the number you are dividing by is coprime with the modulus (they share no common divisors other than 1). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), and c has a multiplicative inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / d) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
You can raise both sides of a congruence to a power, and the result will be congruent modulo n.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have modular inverses; an integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory, as well as in practical applications such as calculating the day of the week for a given date. It simplifies arithmetic for large numbers by dealing with their remainders and has properties that are useful in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible values of p^2-q^2 mod 24 for prime numbers p and q greater than 3.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. All prime numbers greater than 3 has the form of 6n±1.
2. If a | b and c | d, then ac | bd.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all possible values of p² - q² mod 24 for prime numbers p and q greater than 3, we can use the difference of squares formula and the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, recall the difference of squares formula:
p² - q² = (p + q)(p - q)

Since p and q are both primes greater than 3, they must be of the form 6n ± 1, according to the given information. This means that both p and q are either 1 mod 6 or -1 mod 6.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values of p + q and p - q modulo 6:

If both p and q are 1 mod 6, then:
p + q ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 6)
p - q ≡ 1 - 1 ≡ 0 (mod 6) or p - q ≡ 1 - (-1) ≡ 2 (mod 6)

If both p and q are -1 mod 6, then:
p + q ≡ -1 + (-1) ≡ -2 ≡ 4 (mod 6)
p - q ≡ -1 - (-1) ≡ 0 (mod 6) or p - q ≡ -1 - 1 ≡ -2 ≡ 4 (mod 6)

If p is 1 mod 6 and q is -1 mod 6, or vice versa, then:
p + q ≡ 1 + (-1) ≡ 0 (mod 6)
p - q ≡ 1 - (-1) ≡ 2 (mod 6) or p - q ≡ -1 - 1 ≡ -2 ≡ 4 (mod 6)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values of p + q and p - q modulo 4, since 24 = 6 * 4 and we need to find the result modulo 24:

Since p and q are odd (all primes greater than 2 are odd), p + q will always be even, and p - q will also always be even. Therefore, p + q and p - q are either 0 or 2 mod 4.

Combining the results from modulo 6 and modulo 4, we can now consider the possible values of (p + q)(p - q) modulo 24. We need to consider the cases where the product is 0 mod 6 and 0 mod 4, or 2 mod 6 and 2 mod 4, or 4 mod 6 and 2 mod 4.

Case 1: (p + q)(p - q) ≡ 0 * 0 ≡ 0 (mod 24)
Case 2: (p + q)(p - q) ≡ 2 * 2 ≡ 4 (mod 24)
Case 3: (p + q)(p - q) ≡ 4 * 2 ≡ 8 (mod 24)

These are the possible values of p² - q² mod 24 for prime numbers p and q greater than 3. However, we must also consider that p and q are distinct primes, so p - q cannot be 0. Therefore, we can eliminate Case 1.

The final possible values of p² - q² mod 24 for distinct primes p and q greater than 3 are 4 and 8.</code></pre>
