Find all integer solutions to the equations x^5+y^5=33, x+y=3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let s_n=x^n+y^n, u=x+y, v=xy.
2. We have s_0=2, s_1=u.
3. Thus, s_2=u^2-2v, s_3=u^3-3uv, s_4=u^4-4u^2*v+2v^2 and s_5=u^5-5u^3*v+5u*v^2.
4. Since s_5=33 and u=3, we have v^2-9v+14=0, and v=2 or v=7.
5. For v=2, we need to find the integer solutions to x+y=3 and xy=2, which are (x=1, y=2) and (x=2, y=1).
6. For v=7, we need to find the integer solutions to x+y=3 and xy=7, which has no solution.
7. Thus, the solutions are (x=1, y=2) and (x=2, y=1).</code></pre>

Find all possible values of p^2-q^2 mod 24 for prime numbers p and q greater than 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have p=6n±1 and q=6m±1.
2. Thus, p^2-q^2=(p+q)(p-q)=(6n+6m±2)(6n-6m)=6*(6(n+m)±2)(n-m) or (6n+6m)(6n-6m±2)=6*(6(n-m)±2)(n+m).
3. If n+m is even, then n-m is also even and we have 4 | (6(n+m)±2)(n-m).
4. If n-m is odd, then n+m is also odd and we have 6(n±m)/2 being odd.
5. Thus, 6(n±m) mod 4=2 and 6(n±m)±2 mod 4=0.
6. In both cases, we have 24 | p^2-q^2 by considering the coefficient 6 in front.
7. So, p^2-q^2 mod 24=0.</code></pre>

How many different ordered triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers are there such that a+b+c=99?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. For any c, we know that a+b=99-c.
2. Thus, there are 99-c+1 different values of (a, b), ranging from (0, 99-c) to (99-c, 0).
3. We know that c can range from 0 to 99.
4. Thus, the total number of ordered triples is 100+99+...+1=(100+1)*100/2=5050.</code></pre>

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We need one rook per row and one rook per column.
2. If n is odd, for a 180-degree rotation-invariant placement, we must have the center of the board being occupied by a rook.
3. Thus, the number of placement of a 2k+1 x 2k+1 board is the same as that of a 2k x 2k board.
4. For a 2k x 2k board, for any placement on the first row, the corresponding placement on the last row is fully determined.
5. By removing the two rows and two columns, we get a 2k-2 x 2k-2 board.
6. Since there are 2k possible placement on the first row, we have P(2k)=2k*P(2k-2), where P(2k) is the number of placements on the 2k x 2k board.
7. We have P(2)=2, because the two rooks need to be on opposite corners.
8. Thus, P(2k)=(2k)(2k-2)(2k-4)...(2)=2^k*k!.
9. Substituing n=2k, we have P(n)=2^(n/2)*(n/2)! for even n.
10. Since P(2k+1)=P(2k), we have P(n)=2^floor(n/2)*floor(n/2)! for all n.</code></pre>

Let f(x)=(1-x+x^2-x^3+...-x^99+x^100)(1+x+x^2+x^3+...+x^99+x^100). What is the sum of coefficients of the terms x^1, x^3, ..., x^97, x^99 in the expansion form of f(x)?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have f(-x)=(1+x+x^2+x^3+...+x^99+x^100)(1-x+x^2-x^3+...-x^99+x^100)=f(x).
2. Thus, f(x) is an even function.
3. Since x^n is an even function if n is even, and is an odd function if n is odd, we know that f(x) must be a sum of even functions, which means that it does not contain the terms x, x^3, x^5, ..., x^99.
4. Thus, the sum of their coefficients is 0.</code></pre>

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the prime factorization of perfect powers.

The left side of the equation, (n-1)n(n+1), represents the product of three consecutive integers. This is a sequence of three numbers where one of them must be divisible by 3, and exactly one of them is even, thus divisible by 2. Therefore, the product is divisible by 6.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the right side of the equation, a^m. Since m &gt; 1, a^m is a perfect power and has a prime factorization where each prime factor appears m times.

Since the left side is divisible by 6, the right side must also be divisible by 6. This means that a^m must have at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 3. Since a^m is a perfect power with each prime factor appearing m times, this implies that a itself must be divisible by both 2 and 3. However, since 2 and 3 are prime, the smallest value for a that is divisible by both is their product, 6. Therefore, a must be a power of 6, i.e., a = 6^k for some k.

Now, let&#x27;s rewrite the equation with this new information:

(n-1)n(n+1) = (6^k)^m = 6^(km)

Since the left side is the product of three consecutive integers, we can consider the cases where n-1, n, or n+1 is the multiple of 3. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume n is a multiple of 3, as the reasoning will be similar for n-1 or n+1.

Let n = 3p for some integer p. Then the equation becomes:

(3p-1)(3p)(3p+1) = 6^(km)

Now, we have three consecutive integers (3p-1), 3p, and (3p+1), where one is a multiple of 3, and one is even. The product of these three numbers must be a perfect power of 6, which means that the even number must be a power of 2, and the remaining number must be a power of 3.

Since 3p is already a multiple of 3, either 3p-1 or 3p+1 must be a power of 2. However, since 3p is not even, 3p-1 and 3p+1 are both even, and exactly one of them must be a power of 2. But the difference between two consecutive powers of 2 is always greater than 2, except for 1 and 2 themselves. Therefore, the only possibility is that one of them is 2 and the other is a power of 3.

The only case where this happens is when p = 1, which gives us:

n = 3p = 3
n-1 = 2
n+1 = 4

So the only solution is when n = 3, which gives us:

(2)(3)(4) = 24 = 2^3 * 3 = 6^2

Therefore, the only solution is n = 3, a = 6, and m = 2.</code></pre>
