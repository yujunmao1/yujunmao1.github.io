<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients. If there are three different integers a, b, c, such that f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=-1, then at most how many integer-valued roots can this polynomial have?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let g(x)=f(x)+1, so a, b, c are the three roots of g(x).
2. Thus, g(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x) for some polynomial h(x).
3. If there exists integer k such that f(k)=0, then g(k)=f(k)+1=1.
4. This means that (k-a)(k-b)(k-c)h(k)=1.
5. The first three terms are all distinct integers, but 1 can be the product of at most one distinct integers (1 itself).
6. Thus, we have a contradiction, and no such k exists.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a polynomial f(x) of degree n with integer coefficients, if both f(0) and f(1) are odd, at most how many integer-valued zeros can it have?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of polynomials with integer coefficients and the parity of the function values at specific points.

Let&#x27;s analyze the given information:

1. f(x) is a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients.
2. f(0) is odd.
3. f(1) is odd.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the polynomial evaluated at an integer-valued zero, say k, where k is an integer. If f(k) = 0, then k is a root of the polynomial f(x).

Since f(0) is odd, we can write f(0) = 2m + 1 for some integer m. Similarly, since f(1) is odd, we can write f(1) = 2n + 1 for some integer n.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the polynomial f(x) - f(0). This new polynomial has the same roots as f(x) except for x = 0, which is no longer a root since f(0) - f(0) = 0. However, the new polynomial has the property that it evaluates to an even number at x = 0 because f(0) - f(0) = 0, which is even.

Let&#x27;s denote this new polynomial as g(x) = f(x) - f(0). Now, g(0) = 0 (even) and g(1) = f(1) - f(0) = (2n + 1) - (2m + 1) = 2(n - m), which is also even.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the polynomial g(x) evaluated at an integer-valued zero k. If g(k) = 0, then f(k) = f(0) = 2m + 1, which is odd. But since g(k) = f(k) - f(0), we have g(k) = (2m + 1) - (2m + 1) = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the polynomial g(x) - g(1). This polynomial, which we&#x27;ll call h(x), has the same roots as g(x) except for x = 1, which is no longer a root since g(1) - g(1) = 0. However, h(x) has the property that it evaluates to an even number at x = 1 because g(1) - g(1) = 0, which is even.

So, h(x) = g(x) - g(1) = f(x) - f(0) - (f(1) - f(0)) = f(x) - f(1).

Now, h(0) = f(0) - f(1) = (2m + 1) - (2n + 1) = 2(m - n), which is even, and h(1) = f(1) - f(1) = 0, which is also even.

If h(x) has an integer-valued zero, say k (where k is not 0 or 1 since those are not zeros of h(x)), then h(k) = f(k) - f(1) = 0 - (2n + 1) = - (2n + 1), which is odd.

However, we have established that h(x) evaluates to an even number at integer values (since both h(0) and h(1) are even), so we have a contradiction. Therefore, h(x) cannot have any integer-valued zeros other than 0 and 1, which are not zeros of h(x).

Since h(x) = f(x) - f(1) and f(x) is the original polynomial, we conclude that f(x) cannot have any integer-valued zeros other than possibly 0 and 1. However, since f(0) and f(1) are both odd, they cannot be zeros of f(x).

Therefore, the polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients, where both f(0) and f(1) are odd, cannot have any integer-valued zeros. The answer to the problem is that at most, f(x) can have 0 integer-valued zeros.</code></pre>
