<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A number is a multiple of 4 if and only if the number consisting of its last two digit is divisible by 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a quick test to determine if a whole number is divisible by 4. To apply this concept, you only need to look at the last two digits of the number. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Consider the number 1,236. To determine if it&#x27;s a multiple of 4, we only need to look at the last two digits, which are 36. Now, we check if 36 is divisible by 4:

36 รท 4 = 9

Since 36 is divisible by 4 (with no remainder), the original number, 1,236, is also a multiple of 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the four-digit number abcd such that 4*abcd=dcba.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the four-digit number as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are its digits. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 4 \times abcd = dcba \]

This equation implies that \( abcd \) is a four-digit number and \( dcba \) is the number formed by reversing its digits. We can express \( abcd \) and \( dcba \) in terms of their digits as follows:

\[ abcd = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \]
\[ dcba = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

The equation \( 4 \times abcd = dcba \) then becomes:

\[ 4 \times (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ 4000a + 400b + 40c + 4d = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Now, let&#x27;s rearrange the terms to group the coefficients of the same digits:

\[ (4000a - a) + (400b - 10b) + (40c - 100c) + (4d - 1000d) = 0 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c - 996d = 0 \]

Since \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. We can also see that \( a \) cannot be 0 because \( abcd \) is a four-digit number. Additionally, \( d \) must be a multiple of 4 because \( 4 \times abcd \) ends with the digit \( d \), and for the product to be a four-digit number, \( d \) must be 1 or 2 (since \( 4 \times 3 \) already gives a two-digit number).

Let&#x27;s try \( d = 1 \) and \( d = 2 \) to see which one works:

If \( d = 1 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c - 996 = 0 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c = 996 \]

If \( d = 2 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c - 1992 = 0 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b - 60c = 1992 \]

Now, we can use the divisibility rule for 4 on the last two digits of \( abcd \) to further narrow down the possibilities. Since \( 4 \times abcd \) ends with \( d \), the last two digits of \( abcd \) must be either \( 04 \), \( 08 \), \( 12 \), \( 16 \), \( 20 \), \( 24 \), \( 28 \), \( 32 \), \( 36 \), \( 40 \), \( 44 \), \( 48 \), \( 52 \), \( 56 \), \( 60 \), \( 64 \), \( 68 \), \( 72 \), \( 76 \), \( 80 \), \( 84 \), \( 88 \), \( 92 \), or \( 96 \).

Since \( c \) must be one of these last digits, let&#x27;s try \( d = 1 \) with \( c = 0 \) and \( c = 2 \) (the only options that make \( 10c + d \) divisible by 4):

If \( d = 1 \) and \( c = 0 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b = 996 \]
This equation cannot be true because the left side is divisible by 3, while the right side is not.

If \( d = 1 \) and \( c = 2 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b - 120 = 996 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b = 1116 \]

Now, we need to find values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the equation holds. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits, \( a \) can be at most 2 (because \( 3999 \times 3 \) is greater than 1116). Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \) and \( a = 2 \):

If \( a = 1 \):
\[ 3999 + 390b = 1116 \]
\[ 390b = 1116 - 3999 \]
\[ 390b = -2883 \]
This is not possible since \( b \) is a digit and cannot be negative.

If \( a = 2 \):
\[ 7998 + 390b = 1116 \]
\[ 390b = 1116 - 7998 \]
\[ 390b = -6882 \]
This is also not possible for the same reason.

Therefore, our assumption that \( d = 1 \) must be incorrect. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 2 \):

If \( d = 2 \) and \( c = 0 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b = 1992 \]
This equation cannot be true because the left side is divisible by 3, while the right side is not.

If \( d = 2 \) and \( c = 4 \):
\[ 3999a + 390b - 240 = 1992 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b = 2232 \]

Now, we need to find values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the equation holds. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits, \( a \) can be at most 2 (because \( 3999 \times 3 \) is greater than 2232). Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \) and \( a = 2 \):

If \( a = 1 \):
\[ 3999 + 390b = 2232 \]
\[ 390b = 2232 - 3999 \]
\[ 390b = -1767 \]
This is not possible since \( b \) is a digit and cannot be negative.

If \( a = 2 \):
\[ 7998 + 390b = 2232 \]
\[ 390b = 2232 - 7998 \]
\[ 390b = -5766 \]
This is also not possible for the same reason.

It seems there was a mistake in our calculations. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate the situation with \( d = 2 \) and \( c = 4 \):

\[ 3999a + 390b - 240 = 1992 \]
\[ 3999a + 390b = 2232 \]

Now, we need to find values of \( a \) and \( b \) such that the equation holds. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are digits, \( a \) can be at most 2 (because \( 3999 \times 3 \) is greater than 2232). Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):

\[ 3999 + 390b = 2232 \]
\[ 390b = 2232 - 3999 \]
\[ 390b = -1767 \]
