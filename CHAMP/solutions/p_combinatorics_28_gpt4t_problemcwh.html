<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?
Step-wise solution:
1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.
2. We can paint it on top, the remaining four faces have 4! colorings, but we can rotate the cube four times, which makes four colorings the same, so we 4!/4=6 distinct colorings.
3. If the second face is on the side, we can put it on the front, and the two faces uniquely fix the rotation.
4. Thus, any coloring of the remaining four faces is distinct, and we have 4!=24 colorings.
5. In total, we have 30 colorings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Let f(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.
2. Find f(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).
3. Find g(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of finding the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2, and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors, we can use the recursive relations for f(n) and g(n) as defined.

Let&#x27;s define f(n) and g(n) more precisely:
- f(n) is the number of length-n strings ending with 1, where no two 1s are neighbors.
- g(n) is the number of length-n strings ending with 2 or 3, where no two 1s are neighbors.

Now, let&#x27;s find the recursive relations for f(n+1) and g(n+1):

1. f(n+1): A string of length n+1 ending with 1 can only be formed by appending a 1 to a string of length n that ends with 2 or 3 (to ensure no two 1s are neighbors). Therefore, f(n+1) = g(n).

2. g(n+1): A string of length n+1 ending with 2 or 3 can be formed by appending a 2 or 3 to any string of length n (regardless of whether it ends with 1, 2, or 3). Therefore, g(n+1) = f(n) + g(n).

Now, we need to find the initial conditions for f(n) and g(n) for n=1:
- f(1) = 1 (the string is just &quot;1&quot;)
- g(1) = 2 (the strings are &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;)

Using the recursive relations and initial conditions, we can calculate f(n) and g(n) for n=2, 3, 4, and 5.

For n=2:
- f(2) = g(1) = 2
- g(2) = f(1) + g(1) = 1 + 2 = 3

For n=3:
- f(3) = g(2) = 3
- g(3) = f(2) + g(2) = 2 + 3 = 5

For n=4:
- f(4) = g(3) = 5
- g(4) = f(3) + g(3) = 3 + 5 = 8

For n=5:
- f(5) = g(4) = 8
- g(5) = f(4) + g(4) = 5 + 8 = 13

The total number of strings of length 5 where no two 1s are neighbors is the sum of f(5) and g(5):
Total = f(5) + g(5) = 8 + 13 = 21

Therefore, there are 21 strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2, and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.</code></pre>
