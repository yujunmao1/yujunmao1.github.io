<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (or sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. 

For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the formula:

S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

where:
- S is the sum of the first n terms,
- a is the first term,
- r is the common ratio, and
- n is the number of terms.

This formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a * r^(n-1), and the sum of these terms forms a geometric series.

If the absolute value of r is greater than 1, the terms of the series become larger as n increases, and the series has no sum. However, if the absolute value of r is less than 1, the terms of the series become smaller as n increases, and the series has a sum, which can be found using the formula above.

For example, in the geometric progression 2, 6, 18, 54, ..., the sum of the first 4 terms would be:

S = 2 * (1 - 3^4) / (1 - 3) = -160

Note that the sum is negative because the common ratio is greater than 1, so the terms of the series become larger and the sum becomes more negative as n increases.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a≤b, define the sequence as a_1=a, a_2=b, a_(n+2)=(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2. Does the limit exist for this sequence, and if so, find it as an expression in terms of a and b.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If an (infinite) sequence converges to a limit, then all (infinite) subsequences converge, and converge to the same limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a recursive sequence where each term is the average of the two preceding terms. 

Let&#x27;s denote the limit of the sequence as L. If the sequence converges, then the terms a_n and a_(n+1) will both get arbitrarily close to L as n goes to infinity. 

So, we can write the recursive relation in terms of L:

L = (L + L) / 2

Solving this equation gives L = L, which is always true. This means that if the sequence converges, it will converge to a single limit.

Now, let&#x27;s prove that the sequence does indeed converge. 

We can see that the sequence is bounded. Since a ≤ b, all terms a_n are between a and b. 

Also, the sequence is monotonic, meaning it either only increases or only decreases. To see this, note that if a_n ≤ a_(n+1), then a_(n+2) = (a_n + a_(n+1)) / 2 is also less than or equal to a_(n+1), because a_n ≤ a_(n+1) implies that (a_n + a_(n+1)) / 2 ≤ a_(n+1). 

So, the sequence is decreasing if a ≤ b. Similarly, we can show that the sequence is increasing if a ≥ b.

A sequence that is bounded and monotonic always converges, so our sequence does indeed converge.

Now, let&#x27;s find the limit. 

We know that the sequence is getting arbitrarily close to some limit L. So, we can write the recursive relation in terms of L:

L = (L + L) / 2

Solving this equation gives L = L, which doesn&#x27;t tell us much. 

However, we can also write the recursive relation for the first two terms of the sequence:

b = (a + b) / 2

Solving this equation gives a = b, which means that the sequence converges to the limit L = b.

So, the limit of the sequence is b, regardless of the value of a (as long as a ≤ b).</code></pre>
