<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and other fields. It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional arithmetic.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, which is equivalent to 5 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, which is equivalent to 0 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus. For example, you can divide 13 by 4 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 4 and 12 are relatively prime. The result of the division is 3. However, you cannot divide 13 by 12 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 12 and 12 are not relatively prime.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. It is the number that the other numbers are &quot;wrapped around&quot; to. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but it is a very powerful tool that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For three integer numbers a, b, c, if their sum a+b+c is divisible by 6, is their cubed sum a^3+b^3+c^3 always divisble by 6?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study u^3-u mod 2 and u^3-u mod 3 for arbitrary integer u.
2. If a | c, b | c and gcd(a, b)=1, then ab | c.
3. If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The answer is no, the cubed sum of three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is not always divisible by 6 if their sum $a+b+c$ is divisible by 6.

To prove this, we can use the following theorem:

**Theorem:** If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, then $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $abc$ if and only if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all even or all odd.

Proof:

$(\Rightarrow)$ If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all even, then we can write them as $a=2x$, $b=2y$, and $c=2z$ for some integers $x$, $y$, and $z$. Substituting these into the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3$, we get

$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (2x)^3 + (2y)^3 + (2z)^3 = 8x^3 + 8y^3 + 8z^3 = 8(x^3 + y^3 + z^3).$$

Since $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$ is a sum of three cubes, it is divisible by 8. Therefore, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $abc$.

$(\Leftarrow)$ If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all odd, then we can write them as $a=2x+1$, $b=2y+1$, and $c=2z+1$ for some integers $x$, $y$, and $z$. Substituting these into the equation $a^3+b^3+c^3$, we get

$$a^3+b^3+c^3 = (2x+1)^3 + (2y+1)^3 + (2z+1)^3 = 8x^3 + 12x^2 + 6x + 1 + 8y^3 + 12y^2 + 6y + 1 + 8z^3 + 12z^2 + 6z + 1 = 8(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) + 24(xy + xz + yz) + 6(x + y + z).$$

Since $x^3 + y^3 + z^3$ is a sum of three cubes, it is divisible by 8. Therefore, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $8(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$. Since $x$, $y$, and $z$ are all odd, $x+y+z$ is even. Therefore, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $8(x^3 + y^3 + z^3)$ and $2$. Hence, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $abc$.

Therefore, if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, then $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $abc$ if and only if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all even or all odd.

Now, let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be three integers such that $a+b+c$ is divisible by 6. We can write $a+b+c = 6k$ for some integer $k$. Then, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all even or all odd. Therefore, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is divisible by $abc$. However, $a^3+b^3+c^3$ is not necessarily divisible by 6. For example, if $a=b=c=2$, then $a^3+b^3+c^3 = 8$, which is not divisible by 6.

Therefore, the cubed sum of three integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is not always divisible by 6 if their sum $a+b+c$ is divisible by 6.</code></pre>
