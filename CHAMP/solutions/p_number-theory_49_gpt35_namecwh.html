<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic that deals with remainders. It is often used in number theory, cryptography, and computer science. The basic idea is to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a fixed range, called the modulus.

In modular arithmetic, we consider a set of numbers that are congruent to each other modulo a given modulus. Two numbers are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference is divisible by n. This is denoted as a ≡ b (mod n), where a and b are the numbers being compared, and n is the modulus.

Modular arithmetic follows a set of rules that govern the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These rules are:

1. Addition: (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n
   This rule states that when adding two numbers, we can take the sum of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the sum.

2. Subtraction: (a - b) mod n = (a mod n - b mod n) mod n
   Similar to addition, when subtracting two numbers, we can take the difference of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the difference.

3. Multiplication: (a * b) mod n = (a mod n * b mod n) mod n
   For multiplication, we can take the product of the remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the product.

4. Division: (a / b) mod n = (a mod n * b^(-1) mod n) mod n
   Division in modular arithmetic involves finding the modular multiplicative inverse of b (if it exists) and multiplying it with the remainder of a modulo n.

These rules allow us to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a modulus, which is particularly useful when dealing with cyclic patterns or when working with large numbers in computer algorithms.

For example, let&#x27;s consider modular arithmetic modulo 7. If we want to find the remainder of 23 divided by 7, we can use the division rule:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 7^(-1) mod 7) mod 7
Since 7^(-1) mod 7 = 1, we have:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 1) mod 7 = 23 mod 7 = 2

In this case, the remainder of 23 divided by 7 is 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For three integer numbers a, b, c, if their sum a+b+c is divisible by 6, is their cubed sum a^3+b^3+c^3 always divisble by 6?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study u^3-u mod 2 and u^3-u mod 3 for arbitrary integer u.
2. If a | c, b | c and gcd(a, b)=1, then ab | c.
3. If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the cubed sum of three integers, a^3 + b^3 + c^3, is always divisible by 6 when their sum a + b + c is divisible by 6, we need to analyze the problem using the given information.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the remainders of u^3 - u when divided by 2 and 3, as mentioned in the first piece of information.

1. u^3 - u mod 2:
   When u is an even integer, u^3 is also even, and u^3 - u will be divisible by 2.
   When u is an odd integer, u^3 is also odd, and u^3 - u will be divisible by 2.
   Therefore, u^3 - u is always divisible by 2.

2. u^3 - u mod 3:
   We can consider the possible remainders of u when divided by 3: 0, 1, and 2.
   - For u ≡ 0 (mod 3), u^3 ≡ 0 (mod 3), and u^3 - u ≡ 0 (mod 3).
   - For u ≡ 1 (mod 3), u^3 ≡ 1 (mod 3), and u^3 - u ≡ 0 (mod 3).
   - For u ≡ 2 (mod 3), u^3 ≡ 2 (mod 3), and u^3 - u ≡ 0 (mod 3).
   Therefore, u^3 - u is always divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the given condition that a + b + c is divisible by 6. We can express this as:
a + b + c ≡ 0 (mod 6)

We want to determine if a^3 + b^3 + c^3 is always divisible by 6. So, we need to analyze the expression:
(a^3 + b^3 + c^3) ≡ ? (mod 6)

Using the second and third pieces of information, we can consider the remainders of a, b, and c when divided by 2 and 3.

Case 1: If any of a, b, or c is divisible by 2:
   Let&#x27;s assume a is divisible by 2 (the same reasoning applies if b or c is divisible by 2).
   Then a ≡ 0 (mod 2), and a^3 ≡ 0 (mod 2) by the first piece of information.
   Similarly, b^3 ≡ 0 (mod 2) and c^3 ≡ 0 (mod 2) if b or c is divisible by 2.
   Therefore, (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) ≡ 0 (mod 2).

Case 2: If none of a, b, or c is divisible by 2:
   In this case, a, b, and c are all odd integers.
   By the first piece of information, a^3 - a ≡ 0 (mod 2), b^3 - b ≡ 0 (mod 2), and c^3 - c ≡ 0 (mod 2).
   Adding these congruences, we have:
   (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - (a + b + c) ≡ 0 (mod 2)
   Since a + b + c ≡ 0 (mod 6), we can substitute it into the congruence:
   (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 0 ≡ 0 (mod 2)
   Therefore, (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) ≡ 0 (mod 2).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the remainders of a, b, and c when divided by 3.

Case 1: If any of a, b, or c is divisible by 3:
   Let&#x27;s assume a is divisible by 3 (the same reasoning applies if b or c is divisible by 3).
   Then a ≡ 0 (mod 3), and a^3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) by the first piece of information.
   Similarly, b^3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and c^3 ≡ 0 (mod 3) if b or c is divisible by 3.
   Therefore, (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) ≡ 0 (mod 3).

Case 2: If none of a, b, or c is divisible by 3:
   In this case, a, b, and c leave remainders of 1 or 2 when divided by 3.
   By the first piece of information, a^3 - a ≡ 0 (mod 3), b^3 - b ≡ 0 (mod 3), and c^3 - c ≡ 0 (mod 3).
   Adding these congruences, we have:
   (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - (a + b + c) ≡ 0 (mod 3)
   Since a + b + c ≡ 0 (mod 6), we can substitute it into the congruence:
   (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) - 0 ≡ 0 (mod 3)
   Therefore, (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) ≡ 0 (mod 3).

Combining the results from both cases, we can conclude that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) is always divisible by both 2 and 3 when a + b + c is divisible by 6.

Since 2 and 3 are relatively prime (their greatest common divisor is 1), using the third piece of information, we can conclude that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) is divisible by 6.

Therefore, the cubed sum of three integers, a^3 + b^3 + c^3, is always divisible by 6 when their sum a + b + c is divisible by 6.</code></pre>
