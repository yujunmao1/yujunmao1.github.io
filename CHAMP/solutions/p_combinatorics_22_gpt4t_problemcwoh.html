<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: 8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?
Step-wise solution:
1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white.
2. We can derive 8 numbers, being the numbers of white dots to the left of the first black dot, in between each black dots, and to the right of the last black dot.
3. Obviously each number is non-negative and all numbers sum up to 3.
4. Thus, we can consider this as one possible result of the fight.
5. Furthermore, each fight result can also be encoded as a dot configuration.
6. So there are C(10, 7)=C(10, 3)=120 possible results.

Problem: A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?
Step-wise solution:
1. Since we are only interested in the probability of no-adjacent-apple-tree configuration, we do not need to distinguish among the 3 apple trees, nor do we need to distinguish among the 5 other threes.
2. We consider a row of 5 dots, representing the 5 other trees.
3. We can place 3 dividers into 6 locations (1 on each side and 4 in the middle), which corresponds to a unique configuration of planting 3 apple trees among 5 other trees, with no adjacent apple trees.
4. We have C(6, 3)=20 ways to do it.
5. To calculate the total number of ways of planting 3 apple trees and 5 other trees, we select 3 locations among 8 slots, with C(8, 3) ways to do it.
6. Thus, the probability is C(6, 3)/C(8, 3)=20/(8*7*6/(3*2*1))=5*4*3*2*1/(8*7*6)=5/14.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to calculate the arithmetic mean of the smallest element in all possible subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n}.

Let&#x27;s denote the smallest element in a subset as `s`. For a subset of size r, the smallest element `s` can be any number from 1 to n-r+1 (since we need to leave room for the remaining r-1 elements).

For each possible value of `s`, there are C(n-s, r-1) subsets that have `s` as the smallest element. This is because after choosing `s`, we need to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the set {s+1, s+2, ..., n}, which has n-s elements.

The total number of subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n} is C(n, r).

Now, we need to calculate the sum of all possible values of `s` multiplied by the number of subsets for which `s` is the smallest element, and then divide by the total number of subsets to find the arithmetic mean.

The sum can be expressed as:
Sum = Σ[s * C(n-s, r-1)] for s = 1 to n-r+1

To calculate this sum, we need to use the properties of binomial coefficients. We can rewrite C(n-s, r-1) as C(n-s, n-r-s+1) and use the identity C(a, b) = C(a, a-b) to simplify the expression.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the sum:
Sum = Σ[s * C(n-s, n-r-s+1)] for s = 1 to n-r+1

This sum is not straightforward to compute directly, but we can use a combinatorial argument to simplify the problem. We can consider the problem as choosing r elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n} such that the smallest element is s. We can think of this as first choosing the smallest element s and then choosing the remaining r-1 elements from the remaining n-s elements.

To find the mean, we need to divide the sum by the total number of subsets, which is C(n, r).

Mean = Sum / C(n, r)

Unfortunately, there is no simple closed-form expression for the sum as it stands. However, we can use a combinatorial argument to find the mean more directly.

Consider the set {1, 2, ..., n} and all its subsets of size r. For each element i in the set, count how many subsets of size r it is the smallest element of. This is equivalent to choosing the remaining r-1 elements from the set {i+1, i+2, ..., n}, which has n-i elements. So, each element i is the smallest element in C(n-i, r-1) subsets.

The total sum of the smallest elements across all subsets is then the sum of i multiplied by C(n-i, r-1) for i from 1 to n-r+1.

Sum = Σ[i * C(n-i, r-1)] for i = 1 to n-r+1

To find the mean, we divide this sum by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r).

Mean = Sum / C(n, r)

Now, we need to find a way to simplify this sum. One approach is to look for a pattern or a simplification in the terms of the sum. Let&#x27;s consider the series of binomial coefficients and see if we can find a relationship that will help us simplify the sum.

We can use the hockey-stick identity, which states that for any non-negative integers n and r:

Σ[C(k, r)] for k = r to n = C(n+1, r+1)

This identity can be used to sum up consecutive binomial coefficients. However, in our sum, we have an additional factor of i that we need to account for. We can look for a similar identity or relationship that includes this factor.

Unfortunately, there is no straightforward identity that includes this factor, so we need to approach the problem differently. We can look at the problem from a different angle and try to find a pattern or relationship in the subsets themselves that will help us calculate the mean without directly summing the terms.

Let&#x27;s consider the position of the smallest element in the subsets. For each element i from 1 to n-r+1, it can be the smallest element in a subset. If we fix i as the smallest element, then we need to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the set {i+1, i+2, ..., n}, which has n-i elements.

The number of ways to choose these r-1 elements is C(n-i, r-1). So, for each i, there are C(n-i, r-1) subsets where i is the smallest element.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the contribution of each element i to the sum of the smallest elements. For each i, its contribution is i multiplied by the number of subsets where it is the smallest element, which is C(n-i, r-1).

The total contribution of all elements from 1 to n-r+1 to the sum of the smallest elements is then:

Total contribution = Σ[i * C(n-i, r-1)] for i = 1 to n-r+1

To find the mean, we divide this total contribution by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r).

Mean = Total contribution / C(n, r)

Now, we need to find a way to simplify this total contribution. One approach is to look for a pattern or a simplification in the terms of the sum. Let&#x27;s consider the series of binomial coefficients and see if we can find a relationship that will help us simplify the total contribution.

We can use the hockey-stick identity, which states that for any non-negative integers n and r:

Σ[C(k, r)] for k = r to n = C(n+1, r+1)

This identity can be used to sum up consecutive binomial coefficients. However, in our total contribution, we have an additional factor of i that we need to account for. We can look for a similar identity or relationship that includes this factor.

The number of ways to choose these r-1 elements is C(n-i, r-1). So, for each i, there are C(n-i, r-1) subsets where i is the smallest element.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the contribution of each element i to the sum of the smallest elements. For each i, its contribution is i multiplied by the number of subsets where it is the smallest element, which is C(n-i, r-1).

The total contribution of all elements from 1 to n-r+1 to the sum of the smallest elements is then:

Total contribution = Σ[i * C(n-i, r-1)] for i = 1 to n-r+1

To find the mean, we divide this total contribution by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r).

Mean = Total contribution / C(n, r)

The number of ways to choose these r-1 elements is C(n-i, r-1). So, for each i, there are C(n-i, r-1) subsets where i is the smallest element.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the contribution of each element i to the sum of the smallest elements. For each i, its contribution is i multiplied by the number of subsets where it is the smallest element, which is C(n-i, r-1).

The total contribution of all elements from 1 to n-r+1 to the sum of the smallest elements is then:

Total contribution = Σ[i * C(n-i, r-1)] for i = 1 to n-r+1

Mean = Total contribution / C(n, r)

The number of ways to choose these r-1 elements is C(n-i, r-1). So, for each i, there are C(n-i, r-1) subsets where i is the smallest element.
