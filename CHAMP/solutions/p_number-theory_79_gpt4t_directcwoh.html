<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let integer p, q satisfy p/q=1-1/2+1/3-1/4+...-1/1318+1/1319 with gcd(p,q)=1. What is p mod 1979?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to simplify the given expression for p/q and then find p mod 1979.

The given expression is a telescoping series:

p/q = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... - 1/1318 + 1/1319

We can pair the terms in the series as follows:

p/q = (1 - 1/2) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/1317 - 1/1318) + 1/1319

Now, let&#x27;s simplify each pair:

1 - 1/2 = 1/2
1/3 - 1/4 = 1/12
...
1/1317 - 1/1318 = 1/(1317*1318)

Notice that each pair simplifies to the form 1/(n(n-1)), where n is even. This is because:

1/n - 1/(n+1) = (n+1 - n) / (n(n+1)) = 1/(n(n+1))

Now, let&#x27;s look at the series again:

p/q = 1/2 + 1/12 + ... + 1/(1317*1318) + 1/1319

We can see that the denominator of each fraction is the product of two consecutive integers, which means that each term is the difference of the reciprocals of two consecutive integers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the last term separately:

1/1319

Since 1319 is a prime number, it does not simplify with any other term in the series. We will keep this term separate and focus on the rest of the series.

The rest of the series can be rewritten as:

p/q - 1/1319 = 1/2 + 1/12 + ... + 1/(1317*1318)

Now, let&#x27;s find a common denominator for the series (excluding the last term). The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators. However, since the denominators are products of consecutive integers, the LCM is simply the product of all the integers from 2 to 1318.

Therefore, the common denominator is:

q = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 1318

Now, let&#x27;s express the series with this common denominator:

p/q - 1/1319 = (q/2 + q/12 + ... + q/(1317*1318)) / q

Since we want to find p mod 1979, we need to find the numerator modulo 1979. However, we have a problem: the common denominator q is a huge number, and we cannot compute it directly. Instead, we will use the fact that we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 1979.

Let&#x27;s look at the terms in the series modulo 1979:

1/2 mod 1979
1/12 mod 1979
...
1/(1317*1318) mod 1979

Each of these terms can be simplified by finding the modular inverse of the denominator modulo 1979. However, this is a very long process, and we need to find a more efficient way to compute the sum.

Let&#x27;s go back to the original series and consider the terms two by two:

p/q = (1 - 1/2) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/1317 - 1/1318) + 1/1319

We can rewrite this as:

p/q = 1/2 * (2 - 1) + 1/4 * (4 - 3) + ... + 1/1318 * (1318 - 1317) + 1/1319

Now, let&#x27;s look at the terms modulo 1979:

1/2 * (2 - 1) mod 1979 = 1/2 mod 1979
1/4 * (4 - 3) mod 1979 = 1/4 mod 1979
...
1/1318 * (1318 - 1317) mod 1979 = 1/1318 mod 1979

We can see that each term is simply the modular inverse of an even number modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can find the modular inverse of each even number using Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, which states that for a prime p and an integer a such that gcd(a, p) = 1, we have:

a^(p-1) â‰¡ 1 (mod p)

Therefore, the modular inverse of a modulo p is:

a^(p-2) mod p

Let&#x27;s apply this to find the modular inverses of the even numbers modulo 1979:

1/2 mod 1979 = 2^(1979-2) mod 1979
1/4 mod 1979 = 4^(1979-2) mod 1979
...
1/1318 mod 1979 = 1318^(1979-2) mod 1979

Now, we need to sum all these modular inverses modulo 1979. However, this is still a very long process, and we need to find a pattern or a shortcut to compute the sum.

Let&#x27;s consider the pairs of terms in the original series again:

(1 - 1/2) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/1317 - 1/1318) + 1/1319

We can see that the terms cancel out in pairs:

1 cancels with -1/2
1/3 cancels with -1/4
...
1/1317 cancels with -1/1318

The only terms that do not cancel out are 1/1319 and the negative terms with even denominators:

-1/2, -1/4, ..., -1/1318

Let&#x27;s sum these negative terms modulo 1979:

-1/2 - 1/4 - ... - 1/1318 mod 1979

We can rewrite this as:

-(1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/1318) mod 1979

Now, let&#x27;s find the sum of the reciprocals of the even numbers modulo 1979:

1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/1318 mod 1979

We can see that each term is the modular inverse of an even number modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can find the modular inverse of each even number using Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, as we did before.

Let&#x27;s apply this to find the sum of the modular inverses modulo 1979:

(1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/1318) mod 1979 = (2^(1979-2) + 4^(1979-2) + ... + 1318^(1979-2)) mod 1979

Now, we need to compute this sum modulo 1979. However, this is still a very long process, and we need to find a pattern or a shortcut to compute the sum.

Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 2 modulo 1979:

2^(1979-2) mod 1979
4^(1979-2) mod 1979 = (2^2)^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 2^(2*(1979-2)) mod 1979
...
1318^(1979-2) mod 1979 = (2*659)^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 2^(1979-2) * 659^(1979-2) mod 1979

We can see that each term is a power of 2 multiplied by the modular inverse of an odd number modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can find the modular inverse of each odd number using Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, as we did before.

Let&#x27;s apply this to find the sum of the powers of 2 multiplied by the modular inverses of the odd numbers modulo 1979:

(2^(1979-2) * 1^(1979-2) + 2^(2*(1979-2)) * 3^(1979-2) + ... + 2^(1979-2) * 659^(1979-2)) mod 1979

Now, we need to compute this sum modulo 1979. However, this is still a very long process, and we need to find a pattern or a shortcut to compute the sum.

Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 2 modulo 1979 again:

2^(1979-2) mod 1979
2^(2*(1979-2)) mod 1979
...
2^(659*(1979-2)) mod 1979

We can see that each term is a power of 2 raised to a multiple of (1979-2). Since 1979 is a prime number, we can use Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem to simplify these powers of 2:

2^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 1
2^(2*(1979-2)) mod 1979 = 1
...
2^(659*(1979-2)) mod 1979 = 1

Therefore, the sum of the powers of 2 modulo 1979 is simply the number of terms in the sum:

(1 + 1 + ... + 1) mod 1979

The number of terms in the sum is half the number of even numbers from 2 to 1318, which is 1318/2 = 659.

Therefore, the sum of the powers of 2 modulo 1979 is:

659 mod 1979

Now, let&#x27;s find the sum of the modular inverses of the odd numbers modulo 1979:

1^(1979-2) + 3^(1979-2) + ... + 659^(1979-2) mod 1979

We can see that each term is the modular inverse of an odd number modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can find the modular inverse of each odd number using Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, as we did before.

Let&#x27;s apply this to find the sum of the modular inverses modulo 1979:

(1 + 3^(1979-2) + ... + 659^(1979-2)) mod 1979

Now, we need to compute this sum modulo 1979. However, this is still a very long process, and we need to find a pattern or a shortcut to compute the sum.

Let&#x27;s consider the modular inverses of the odd numbers modulo 1979 again:

1 mod 1979
3^(1979-2) mod 1979
...
659^(1979-2) mod 1979

We can see that each term is the modular inverse of an odd number modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can use Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem to simplify these modular inverses:

1 mod 1979 = 1
3^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 1
...
659^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 1

Therefore, the sum of the modular inverses of the odd numbers modulo 1979 is simply the number of terms in the sum:

(1 + 1 + ... + 1) mod 1979

The number of terms in the sum is the number of odd numbers from 1 to 659, which is 659.

Therefore, the sum of the modular inverses modulo 1979 is:

659 mod 1979

Now, let&#x27;s combine the sum of the powers of 2 and the sum of the modular inverses of the odd numbers modulo 1979:

(659 + 659) mod 1979

The sum is:

1318 mod 1979

Since 1318 is less than 1979, the sum modulo 1979 is simply 1318.

Therefore, the sum of the negative terms in the original series modulo 1979 is:

-1318 mod 1979

Now, let&#x27;s add the last term 1/1319 modulo 1979:

-1318 + 1/1319 mod 1979

We need to find the modular inverse of 1319 modulo 1979. Since 1979 is a prime number, we can use Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem to find the modular inverse:

1/1319 mod 1979 = 1319^(1979-2) mod 1979

Now, we need to compute this modular inverse modulo 1979. However, this is still a very long process, and we need to find a pattern or a shortcut to compute the modular inverse.

Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 1319 modulo 1979:

1319^(1979-2) mod 1979

We can see that this is a power of 1319 raised to (1979-2). Since 1979 is a prime number, we can use Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem to simplify this power:

1319^(1979-2) mod 1979 = 1

Therefore, the modular inverse of 1319 modulo 1979 is simply 1.

Now, let&#x27;s add the modular inverse of 1319 to the sum of the negative terms modulo 1979:

-1318 + 1 mod 1979

The sum is:

-1317 mod 1979

Since we are working with a modulus, we need to find the positive remainder when -1317 is divided by 1979. To do this, we can add 1979 to -1317:

-1317 + 1979 mod 1979

The sum is:

662 mod 1979

Therefore, the value of p mod 1979 is 662.</code></pre>
