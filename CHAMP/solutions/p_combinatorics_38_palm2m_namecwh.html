<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of either event A or event B occurring is 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1.

The rule of sum can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of rolling a 6 on a die, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails, or the probability of getting a certain letter on a die.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of sum is only valid if the events are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. For example, the event of rolling a 6 on a die and the event of rolling a 1 on a die are mutually exclusive.

If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is not equal to the sum of the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails. This is because the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is affected by the fact that the coin can land on its edge.

The rule of sum is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a mathematical formula that is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a group of items from a larger set of items. The formula is given by:

$nCr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

where $n$ is the number of items in the set, $r$ is the number of items to be chosen, and $n!$ is the factorial of $n$. The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, $5!$ is equal to $120$.

The combination formula can be used to calculate the number of ways to choose a team of players from a group of athletes, the number of ways to choose a committee from a group of people, or the number of ways to choose a group of items from a larger set of items.

For example, if there are 10 athletes and you need to choose a team of 5 players, the number of ways to do this is:

$10C5 = \frac{10!}{(10-5)!5!} = 252$

There are 252 ways to choose a team of 5 players from a group of 10 athletes.

The combination formula can also be used to calculate the number of permutations of a set of items. The permutation formula is given by:

$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$

where $n$ is the number of items in the set, $r$ is the number of items to be arranged, and $n!$ is the factorial of $n$.

The permutation formula can be used to calculate the number of ways to arrange a group of items in a line, the number of ways to arrange a group of items in a circle, or the number of ways to arrange a group of items in a tree.

For example, if there are 5 letters and you need to arrange them in a line, the number of ways to do this is:

$5P5 = \frac{5!}{(5-5)!} = 120$

There are 120 ways to arrange 5 letters in a line.

The combination formula and the permutation formula are two of the most important formulas in probability and statistics. They can be used to calculate the number of ways to choose a group of items from a larger set of items, the number of ways to arrange a group of items in a line, or the number of ways to arrange a group of items in a circle.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. In how many ways can two boys and one girl be selected?
2. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
3. In how many ways can three boys be selected?
4. In how many ways can the three toys be given to the selected children?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) $k$ items from $n$ items is $C(n, k)$. This can be calculated using the following formula:

$$C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$$

where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$, and $(n-k)!$ is the factorial of $n-k$.

The number of ways to choose two boys and one girl is $C_{10, 2} = 45$. This is because there are 10 children in total, and we need to choose 2 boys and 1 girl.

The number of ways to choose three boys is $C_{10, 3} = 120$. This is because there are 10 children in total, and we need to choose 3 boys.

The number of ways to give the three toys to the selected children is $3!$. This is because there are 3 toys, and we need to give one to each child.

Therefore, the total number of ways to select at least two boys is $45 + 120 + 3! = 216$.

Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. We can choose two boys and one girl in $C_{10, 2} = 45$ ways.
2. We can choose three boys in $C_{10, 3} = 120$ ways.
3. We can give the three toys to the selected children in $3!$ ways.
4. Therefore, the total number of ways to select at least two boys is $45 + 120 + 3! = 216$.</code></pre>
