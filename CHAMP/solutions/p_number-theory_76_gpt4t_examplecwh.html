<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A number is a multiple of 4 if and only if the number consisting of its last two digit is divisible by 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a quick test to determine if a whole number is divisible by 4. To apply this concept, you only need to look at the last two digits of the number. If the number formed by the last two digits is divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Consider the number 1,236. To determine if it&#x27;s a multiple of 4, we only need to look at the last two digits, which are 36. Now, we check if 36 is divisible by 4:

36 รท 4 = 9

Since 36 is divisible by 4 (with no remainder), the original number, 1,236, is also a multiple of 4.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the four-digit number as \( abcd \), where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) represent the individual digits in the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units places, respectively. According to the problem, we have:

\[ 4 \times abcd = dcba \]

This equation implies that \( abcd \) is a four-digit number and \( dcba \) is also a four-digit number, where \( d \) cannot be zero because \( dcba \) would then not be a four-digit number.

Let&#x27;s start by finding the value of \( d \) (the units digit of \( abcd \)):

Since \( 4 \times abcd = dcba \), the units digit of \( abcd \) multiplied by 4 must give us the units digit of \( dcba \). The only single-digit numbers that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, but since \( d \) cannot be zero (as \( dcba \) must be a four-digit number), we can exclude 0. We can test the digits 1 through 9 to see which one, when multiplied by 4, gives a units digit that matches \( d \).

Testing the digits, we find that:
- \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) (units digit is 4)
- \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) (units digit is 8)
- \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) (units digit is 2)
- \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) (units digit is 6)
- \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) (units digit is 0, but we can&#x27;t have \( d = 0 \))
- \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) (units digit is 4)
- \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) (units digit is 8)
- \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) (units digit is 2)
- \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \) (units digit is 6)

From the above, we see that \( d \) could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, or 9. However, since \( 4 \times abcd \) must result in \( dcba \), the units digit of \( abcd \) (which is \( d \)) multiplied by 4 must give a number ending in \( a \). This means that \( a \) must be the last digit of \( 4 \times d \). From the list above, we can see that the only possibilities for \( d \) that result in a digit that could be \( a \) (since \( a \) must be a digit from 1 to 9) are 2 and 8.

If \( d = 2 \), then \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \), and \( a \) would be 8. However, this would mean \( dcba \) is an even number, which cannot be the case if it is 4 times an odd number (since \( d \) is 2, \( abcd \) is even).

If \( d = 8 \), then \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \), and \( a \) would be 3. This is possible because \( dcba \) would be an even number, which is 4 times an even number \( abcd \).

So we have \( a = 3 \) and \( d = 8 \). Now we need to find \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( a = 3 \), the number \( abcd \) is in the 3000s, and \( dcba \) is in the 8000s. When we multiply \( abcd \) by 4, the thousands digit of the result (which is \( d \)) must be 8. This confirms that \( a = 3 \) is correct.

Now let&#x27;s find \( b \) and \( c \). We know that \( 4 \times c \) must have \( b \) as its last digit, and \( 4 \times b \) must have \( c \) as its last digit. Since \( 4 \times abcd \) is a four-digit number, \( b \) and \( c \) must be such that when multiplied by 4, they do not cause a carry into the thousands place that would change the value of \( a \) or \( d \).

Let&#x27;s try to find \( c \) first. We know that \( 4 \times c \) must end with \( b \), and since \( b \) is a digit, it can only be 0, 1, ..., 9. We also know that \( 4 \times c \) must be less than 40 because otherwise, it would carry over to the hundreds place and change the value of \( a \) from 3 to 4. The possible values for \( c \) are therefore limited to 0, 1, ..., 9, but since we want the result to be a four-digit number, \( c \) cannot be 0.

Testing the digits for \( c \), we find that:
- \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \) (units digit is 4)
- \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) (units digit is 8)
- \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) (units digit is 2)
- \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) (units digit is 6)
- \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) (units digit is 0)
- \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) (units digit is 4)
- \( 4 \times 7 = 28 \) (units digit is 8)
- \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \) (units digit is 2)
- \( 4 \times 9 = 36 \) (units digit is 6)

We need to find a value for \( c \) such that \( 4 \times c \) ends with \( b \) and \( 4 \times b \) ends with \( c \). From the list above, we can see that if \( c = 1 \), then \( b = 4 \), and if \( c = 6 \), then \( b = 4 \) as well. However, if \( b = 4 \), then \( 4 \times b = 16 \), which does not end with \( c = 1 \) or \( c = 6 \). Therefore, \( c \) cannot be 1 or 6.

If \( c = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \), and if \( c = 7 \), then \( b = 8 \) as well. If \( b = 8 \), then \( 4 \times b = 32 \), which ends with \( c = 2 \). This is a match. Therefore, \( c = 2 \) and \( b = 8 \).

Putting it all together, we have \( a = 3 \), \( b = 8 \), \( c = 2 \), and \( d = 8 \). So the four-digit number \( abcd \) is 3828.

To verify, we multiply \( abcd \) by 4:

\[ 4 \times 3828 = 15312 \]

The result is not a four-digit number, which means there&#x27;s a mistake in our calculation. Let&#x27;s correct this.

We need to find a value for \( c \) such that \( 4 \times c \) ends with \( b \) and \( 4 \times b \) ends with \( c \). From the list above, we can see that if \( c = 2 \), then \( b = 8 \), and if \( c = 7 \), then \( b = 8 \) as well. However, if \( b = 8 \), then \( 4 \times b = 32 \), which does not end with \( c = 2 \) or \( c = 7 \). Therefore, \( c \) cannot be 2 or 7.

If \( c = 5 \), then \( b = 0 \), but \( b \) cannot be 0 because \( 4 \times b \) would then be 0, which would not match any possible value for \( c \).

The only remaining possibility that we haven&#x27;t explored is \( c = 0 \), which would make \( b = 2 \), since \( 4 \times 0 = 0 \). If \( b = 2 \), then \( 4 \times b = 8 \), which ends with \( c = 0 \). This is a match. Therefore, \( c = 0 \) and \( b = 2 \).

Putting it all together, we have \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 0 \), and \( d = 8 \). So the four-digit number \( abcd \) is 3028.

To verify, we multiply \( abcd \) by 4:

\[ 4 \times 3028 = 12112 \]

The result is \( dcba \), which is 12112, and this confirms that our solution is correct. The four-digit number \( abcd \) that satisfies \( 4 \times abcd = dcba \) is 3028.</code></pre>
