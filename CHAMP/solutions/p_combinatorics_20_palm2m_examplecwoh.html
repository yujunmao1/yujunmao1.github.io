<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 5 rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles (i.e., a 2 x 2 tile without a corner).

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is one way to solve the problem:

We can think of the problem as follows. We have a 2 x 5 rectangle, and we want to fill it with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles. The 1 x 1 tiles can be placed in any of the 10 cells in the rectangle, and the three-cell L-shaped tiles can be placed in any of the 5 cells in the first row or the last row.

To count the number of ways to fill the rectangle, we can first count the number of ways to place the 1 x 1 tiles. There are 10 ways to do this. Then, we can count the number of ways to place the three-cell L-shaped tiles. There are 5 ways to do this in the first row, and 5 ways to do this in the last row. So, there are a total of 10 * 5 = 50 ways to fill the rectangle.

However, we have counted each arrangement of the tiles twice. For example, if we place a 1 x 1 tile in the first cell, a 1 x 1 tile in the second cell, and a three-cell L-shaped tile in the third cell, we have also counted the arrangement where we place a 1 x 1 tile in the second cell, a 1 x 1 tile in the first cell, and a three-cell L-shaped tile in the third cell. To account for this, we need to divide the number of ways to place the tiles by 2.

So, the number of ways to fill the rectangle is 50 / 2 = 25.

Another way to solve the problem is to use a recurrence relation. Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways to fill a $n \times 5$ rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles. Then, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$f(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } n = 1 \\\ f(n-1) + 5f(n-2) &amp; \text{if } n &gt; 1 \end{cases}$$

The base case is $f(1) = 1$, because there is only one way to fill a 1 x 5 rectangle. The inductive step is $f(n) = f(n-1) + 5f(n-2)$, because we can fill a $n \times 5$ rectangle by either filling a $n-1 \times 5$ rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and a three-cell L-shaped tile in the last row, or by filling a $n-2 \times 5$ rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and two three-cell L-shaped tiles.

We can solve the recurrence relation to get:

$$f(n) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 5^n - 2^n + 1 \right)$$

So, the number of ways to fill a 2 x 5 rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles is $\frac{1}{6} \left( 5^2 - 2^2 + 1 \right) = 25$.</code></pre>
