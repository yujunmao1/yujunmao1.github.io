<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. The rule of sum is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are two or more mutually exclusive events or scenarios.

Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur at the same time; in other words, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. The rule of sum states that if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and another event can occur in \(n\) ways, and the two events cannot occur simultaneously, then there are \(m + n\) ways for either of the events to occur.

Here&#x27;s a simple example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you have a menu with 3 different appetizers and 4 different desserts. If you want to choose either an appetizer or a dessert, but not both, the rule of sum tells you that there are \(3 + 4 = 7\) different choices you can make.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the choices are mutually exclusive. If it were possible to choose both an appetizer and a dessert, then you would need to use a different combinatorial principle, such as the rule of product, to find the total number of combinations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 21 rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles such that the tiling is same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. How must the middle column be tiled?
2. Let a_n be the number of ways to tile a 2 x n rectangle without consideration of the symmetry.
3. Find the expression for a_(n+1) in terms of a_n and a_(n-1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetry constraint imposed by flipping the rectangle around the middle column. Since the rectangle is 2 x 21, the middle column is the 11th column from either side.

1. How must the middle column be tiled?
The middle column (the 11th column) must be tiled in such a way that it is symmetric upon flipping. This means that we can only place two 2 x 1 tiles vertically in the middle column. Any other arrangement would not be symmetric upon flipping.

2. Let \( a_n \) be the number of ways to tile a 2 x n rectangle without consideration of the symmetry.
We need to find an expression for \( a_{n+1} \) in terms of \( a_n \) and \( a_{n-1} \).

To tile a 2 x (n+1) rectangle, we can consider the last column. We can either place a single 2 x 1 tile vertically, which leaves a 2 x n rectangle to be tiled (which can be done in \( a_n \) ways), or we can place two 2 x 1 tiles horizontally, which leaves a 2 x (n-1) rectangle to be tiled (which can be done in \( a_{n-1} \) ways). Therefore, the recurrence relation is:
\[ a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1} \]

This is the Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. Find the number of ways to fill the 2 x 21 rectangle with the symmetry constraint.
Since the middle column must be tiled vertically, we effectively have two separate 2 x 10 rectangles on either side of the middle column that must be tiled identically due to the symmetry constraint.

Let&#x27;s find the number of ways to tile a 2 x 10 rectangle, which will be \( a_{10} \). We can start with the base cases:
\[ a_1 = 1 \] (one vertical tile)
\[ a_2 = 2 \] (either two vertical tiles or two horizontal tiles)

Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( a_3, a_4, \ldots, a_{10} \):
\[ a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
\[ a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 3 + 2 = 5 \]
\[ a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 5 + 3 = 8 \]
\[ a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 8 + 5 = 13 \]
\[ a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 13 + 8 = 21 \]
\[ a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 21 + 13 = 34 \]
\[ a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = 34 + 21 = 55 \]
\[ a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = 55 + 34 = 89 \]

So there are 89 ways to tile a 2 x 10 rectangle. Since the tiling must be symmetric, the number of ways to tile the 2 x 21 rectangle with the symmetry constraint is the same as the number of ways to tile one of the 2 x 10 halves, which is 89.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 89 ways to fill a 2 x 21 rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles such that the tiling is the same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.</code></pre>
