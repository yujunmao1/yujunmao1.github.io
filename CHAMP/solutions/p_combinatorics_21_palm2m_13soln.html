<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 6! = 720 ways to color the faces of a cube with 6 different colors. However, many of these colorings are equivalent up to rotations of the cube. For example, the colorings red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange and orange-white-yellow-green-blue-red are the same, since they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube.

To count the number of distinct colorings, we can use a group action. The group of symmetries of a cube is $S_4$, the group of permutations of 4 objects. This group has 24 elements, corresponding to the 24 ways to rotate a cube.

Each coloring of the cube gives rise to a homomorphism from $S_4$ to the group of symmetries of a color wheel, which has 6 elements. This homomorphism is determined by the way in which the colors of the cube map to the colors of the color wheel.

Two colorings of the cube give rise to the same homomorphism if and only if they are equivalent up to rotations of the cube. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $S_4$ to the group of symmetries of a color wheel.

There are 12 such homomorphisms, corresponding to the 12 ways to partition the set of 6 colors into 2 subsets of 3 colors. Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the group action. The group of symmetries of a cube is $S_4$, the group of permutations of 4 objects. This group has 24 elements, corresponding to the 24 ways to rotate a cube.

Each coloring of the cube gives rise to a homomorphism from $S_4$ to the group of symmetries of a color wheel, which has 6 elements. This homomorphism is determined by the way in which the colors of the cube map to the colors of the color wheel.

For example, consider the coloring red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange. This coloring gives rise to the homomorphism that maps the identity permutation to the identity permutation, the permutation that swaps red and blue to the permutation that swaps red and blue on the color wheel, the permutation that swaps green and yellow to the permutation that swaps green and yellow on the color wheel, the permutation that swaps white and orange to the permutation that swaps white and orange on the color wheel, the permutation that swaps red and green to the permutation that swaps red and green on the color wheel, the permutation that swaps blue and yellow to the permutation that swaps blue and yellow on the color wheel, the permutation that swaps red and white to the permutation that swaps red and white on the color wheel, and the permutation that swaps blue and orange to the permutation that swaps blue and orange on the color wheel.

Two colorings of the cube give rise to the same homomorphism if and only if they are equivalent up to rotations of the cube. Therefore, the number of distinct colorings is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $S_4$ to the group of symmetries of a color wheel.

There are 12 such homomorphisms, corresponding to the 12 ways to partition the set of 6 colors into 2 subsets of 3 colors. Therefore, there are $\boxed{12}$ distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors.</code></pre>
