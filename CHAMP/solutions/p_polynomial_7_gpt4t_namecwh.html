<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Polynomial division is a process similar to long division for numbers, but it is used to divide one polynomial by another. The goal of polynomial division is to determine how many times the divisor polynomial can &quot;fit&quot; into the dividend polynomial, and to find the remainder if the division is not exact.

Here&#x27;s the definition and a brief explanation of the terms involved:

**Dividend**: The polynomial that is being divided. This is analogous to the number you start with in numerical long division.

**Divisor**: The polynomial by which you are dividing the dividend. In numerical division, this would be the number you divide by.

**Quotient**: The result of the division, representing how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend without considering the remainder.

**Remainder**: The part of the dividend that is left over after the division process has been completed. If the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor, the division process is complete.

The process of polynomial division can be done using long division or synthetic division (which is a shortcut method applicable when the divisor is a binomial of the form x - c).

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step outline of the long division process for polynomials:

1. Arrange both the dividend and the divisor polynomials in descending order of their degrees (the highest power of x comes first).

2. Divide the leading term (the term with the highest power of x) of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This gives you the first term of the quotient.

3. Multiply the entire divisor by the term you just found and subtract the result from the dividend. This gives you a new polynomial.

4. Repeat the process using the new polynomial as the dividend. Divide the leading term of the new polynomial by the leading term of the divisor to find the next term of the quotient.

5. Continue this process until the degree of the remainder polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor or until the remainder is zero.

6. The final quotient and remainder give you the result of the division, which can be expressed as:

   Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

For example, if we want to divide the polynomial 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 by x - 2, we would use polynomial long division to find that the quotient is 2x^2 + 7x + 13 and the remainder is 21. So, the division can be expressed as:

   2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 = (x - 2)(2x^2 + 7x + 13) + 21

Polynomial division is useful in various areas of algebra, including simplifying rational expressions, finding polynomial roots, and solving polynomial equations.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the remainder of the polynomial \( x^{100} - 2x^{51} + 1 \) when divided by \( x^2 - 1 \), we can use the Remainder Theorem. The Remainder Theorem states that if a polynomial \( f(x) \) is divided by \( x - c \), the remainder is \( f(c) \).

Since \( x^2 - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x + 1) \), we can find the remainders when \( x^{100} - 2x^{51} + 1 \) is divided by \( x - 1 \) and \( x + 1 \) separately. These remainders will be the values of the polynomial at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -1 \), respectively.

Let&#x27;s evaluate the polynomial at \( x = 1 \):

\( f(1) = 1^{100} - 2 \cdot 1^{51} + 1 = 1 - 2 + 1 = 0 \)

Now, let&#x27;s evaluate the polynomial at \( x = -1 \):

\( f(-1) = (-1)^{100} - 2 \cdot (-1)^{51} + 1 = 1 - 2(-1) + 1 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 \)

The Remainder Theorem tells us that these are the remainders when dividing by \( x - 1 \) and \( x + 1 \), respectively. However, since we are dividing by \( x^2 - 1 \), which is a quadratic, the remainder will be a linear polynomial of the form \( ax + b \).

We know that when \( x = 1 \), the remainder is \( 0 \), and when \( x = -1 \), the remainder is \( 4 \). This gives us two points on the remainder polynomial: \( (1, 0) \) and \( (-1, 4) \).

The remainder polynomial \( r(x) = ax + b \) must pass through these points. So we have two equations:

1. \( a(1) + b = 0 \) (from the point \( (1, 0) \))
2. \( a(-1) + b = 4 \) (from the point \( (-1, 4) \))

Solving the first equation gives us \( b = -a \). Substituting this into the second equation gives us:

\( -a - a = 4 \)
\( -2a = 4 \)
\( a = -2 \)

Now that we have \( a = -2 \), we can find \( b \):

\( b = -a = 2 \)

Therefore, the remainder polynomial is \( r(x) = -2x + 2 \).

So, the remainder of \( x^{100} - 2x^{51} + 1 \) when divided by \( x^2 - 1 \) is \( -2x + 2 \).</code></pre>
