Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.
2. If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.
3. A perfect square number can only end in digit 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9.
4. a^n-1=(a-1)(a^(n-1)+a^(n-2)+...+a+1).
5. For integer x, x^2 mod 9 can take values of 0, 1, 4 and 7.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m, we can consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.

Let&#x27;s consider two cases:

Case 1: (n-1) and (n+1) are both even.
In this case, we can write (n-1) as 2b and (n+1) as 2c, where b and c are integers.
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
2b * 2c = a^m
4bc = a^m

Since 4bc is divisible by 4, a^m must also be divisible by 4. This means a must be even.

Let&#x27;s rewrite a as 2d, where d is an integer.
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
4bc = (2d)^m
4bc = 2^m * d^m
2bc = 2^m * d^m / 2

Since 2bc is divisible by 2, d^m / 2 must also be divisible by 2. This means d must be even.

Let&#x27;s rewrite d as 2e, where e is an integer.
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
2bc = 2^m * (2e)^m
2bc = 2^m * 2^m * e^m
bc = 2^m * e^m

Now, we have bc = 2^m * e^m, where b, c, and e are integers.

From information 2, we know that if a | bc and gcd(b, c) = 1, then we can find integers m, n, p, q such that b = mp, c = nq, gcd(m, n) = gcd(p, q) = 1, and pq = a.

In this case, since b and c are both even, we can write b = 2p and c = 2q, where p and q are integers.
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
2p * 2q = 2^m * e^m
4pq = 2^m * e^m

Since 4pq is divisible by 4, 2^m * e^m must also be divisible by 4. This means e must be even.

Let&#x27;s rewrite e as 2f, where f is an integer.
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
4pq = 2^m * (2f)^m
4pq = 2^m * 2^m * f^m
pq = 2^m * f^m

Now, we have pq = 2^m * f^m, where p, q, and f are integers.

From information 2, we know that if a | bc and gcd(b, c) = 1, then we can find integers m, n, p, q such that b = mp, c = nq, gcd(m, n) = gcd(p, q) = 1, and pq = a.

In this case, since p and q are both integers, we can write p = 1 * p and q = 1 * q, where p and q are integers.
Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
1 * p * 1 * q = 2^m * f^m
pq = 2^m * f^m

Now, we have pq = 2^m * f^m, where p, q, and f are integers.

1 * p * 1 * q = 2^m * f^m
pq = 2^m * f^m
