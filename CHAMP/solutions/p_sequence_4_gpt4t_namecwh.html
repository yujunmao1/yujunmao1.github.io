<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let x_1, x_2&lt;100 be two positive integers. For k≥3, let x_k be the smallest of the absolute values of the pairwise differences of the preceding terms. What are possible values of x_12?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Reorder the first three terms if necessary so that x_1≥x_2≥x_3.
2. Study the monotonicity of this sequence by looking at the pairwise differences that are meaningfully used when computing each x_k.
3. Consider the minimum value of x_1 if x_12≥1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s start by understanding the sequence defined by the problem. We have two initial positive integers \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) such that \( x_1, x_2 &lt; 100 \). For \( k \geq 3 \), \( x_k \) is the smallest of the absolute values of the pairwise differences of the preceding terms.

The sequence starts with \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), and we can assume without loss of generality that \( x_1 \geq x_2 \) (if not, we can simply swap them). The third term \( x_3 \) will be \( x_1 - x_2 \), since this is the only pairwise difference we can form.

For \( k \geq 4 \), \( x_k \) will be the smallest absolute difference between any two of the previous terms. Since we are always taking the smallest absolute difference, the sequence is non-increasing after \( x_3 \). This means that \( x_3 \geq x_4 \geq x_5 \geq ... \geq x_{12} \).

Let&#x27;s denote the difference \( x_1 - x_2 \) as \( d \). Then \( x_3 = d \). The next term, \( x_4 \), will be the smallest of the differences \( |x_1 - x_3|, |x_2 - x_3|, |x_1 - x_2| \). Since \( x_3 = d \), the differences are \( |x_1 - d|, |x_2 - d|, d \). We know that \( x_1 \geq x_2 \), so \( |x_1 - d| \geq |x_2 - d| \), and since \( d = x_1 - x_2 \), \( |x_2 - d| = |x_2 - (x_1 - x_2)| = |2x_2 - x_1| \). The smallest of these differences will be \( x_4 \).

Notice that as we continue this process, we will keep generating differences that are linear combinations of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). Since the sequence is non-increasing and we are looking for the smallest absolute differences, we will eventually reach a point where the differences repeat or become zero. When the difference becomes zero, the sequence will remain constant at zero from that point on.

The key to this sequence is that it will eventually reach the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). This is because the Euclidean algorithm for finding the gcd of two numbers works by repeatedly subtracting the smaller number from the larger one (or finding the remainder when dividing the larger by the smaller, which is equivalent to subtraction for our purposes).

Since we want \( x_{12} \geq 1 \), we need to consider the minimum value of \( x_1 \) such that the sequence does not reach zero before the 12th term. This means that \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) must be relatively prime (their gcd is 1), and the sequence of differences must take as long as possible to reach 1.

The longest such sequence would occur when \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are consecutive Fibonacci numbers, as the Euclidean algorithm takes the most steps to reach the gcd when applied to consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The largest Fibonacci numbers less than 100 are 89 and 55.

Let&#x27;s check if starting with 89 and 55 will give us a sequence that reaches 1 at \( x_{12} \) or later. The sequence of differences will follow the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence in reverse:

\( x_1 = 89, x_2 = 55 \)
\( x_3 = 89 - 55 = 34 \)
\( x_4 = 55 - 34 = 21 \)
\( x_5 = 34 - 21 = 13 \)
\( x_6 = 21 - 13 = 8 \)
\( x_7 = 13 - 8 = 5 \)
\( x_8 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_9 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_{10} = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_{11} = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_{12} = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

So, starting with 89 and 55, we reach 0 at \( x_{12} \), which means that for \( x_{12} \geq 1 \), we need to start with a pair of Fibonacci numbers that are smaller than 89 and 55. The next pair is 55 and 34.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 55, x_2 = 34 \)
\( x_3 = 55 - 34 = 21 \)
\( x_4 = 34 - 21 = 13 \)
\( x_5 = 21 - 13 = 8 \)
\( x_6 = 13 - 8 = 5 \)
\( x_7 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_8 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_9 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_{10} = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_{11} = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{11} \), which is too soon. Therefore, we need to go to the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 34 and 21.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 34, x_2 = 21 \)
\( x_3 = 34 - 21 = 13 \)
\( x_4 = 21 - 13 = 8 \)
\( x_5 = 13 - 8 = 5 \)
\( x_6 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_7 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_8 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_9 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_{10} = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{10} \), which is still too soon. Continuing this process, we go to the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 21 and 13.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 21, x_2 = 13 \)
\( x_3 = 21 - 13 = 8 \)
\( x_4 = 13 - 8 = 5 \)
\( x_5 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_6 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_7 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_8 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_9 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{9} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 13 and 8.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 13, x_2 = 8 \)
\( x_3 = 13 - 8 = 5 \)
\( x_4 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_5 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_6 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_7 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_8 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{8} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 8 and 5.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 8, x_2 = 5 \)
\( x_3 = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
\( x_4 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_5 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_6 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_7 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{7} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 5 and 3.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 5, x_2 = 3 \)
\( x_3 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
\( x_4 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_5 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_6 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{6} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 3 and 2.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 3, x_2 = 2 \)
\( x_3 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
\( x_4 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_5 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{5} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 2 and 1.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 2, x_2 = 1 \)
\( x_3 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
\( x_4 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{4} \), which is still too soon. We continue with the next smaller pair of Fibonacci numbers, which is 1 and 1.

Let&#x27;s check this pair:

\( x_1 = 1, x_2 = 1 \)
\( x_3 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

We reach 0 at \( x_{3} \), which is still too soon. However, we cannot go any lower because we have reached the smallest positive integers.

From this analysis, we can see that the possible values of \( x_{12} \) are 0 or 1. If \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are chosen such that their gcd is reached before the 12th term, then \( x_{12} \) will be 0. If \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are chosen such that their gcd is exactly 1 and the sequence of differences reaches 1 at or after the 12th term, then \( x_{12} \) will be 1. The only way to achieve \( x_{12} = 1 \) is to start with a pair of numbers whose sequence of differences reaches 1 exactly at the 12th term, which we found does not happen for any pair of Fibonacci numbers less than 100. Therefore, the only possible value for \( x_{12} \) under the given conditions is 0.</code></pre>
