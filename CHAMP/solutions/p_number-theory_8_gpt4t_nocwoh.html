Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation given is:

(n - 1)n(n + 1) = a^m

This equation represents the product of three consecutive integers, which is equal to a perfect power of a positive integer a. Since n - 1, n, and n + 1 are consecutive integers, we can observe that one of them must be divisible by 2, and one of them must be divisible by 3. This is because any three consecutive integers will include a multiple of 3, and at least one of them will be even.

Let&#x27;s analyze the possibilities:

1. If n is even, then n - 1 and n + 1 are odd, and one of them must be divisible by 3. Since n is even, n = 2k for some integer k, and the product becomes:

(2k - 1)(2k)(2k + 1)

Here, either 2k - 1 or 2k + 1 is divisible by 3.

2. If n is odd, then n - 1 and n + 1 are even, and n must be divisible by 3. In this case, n = 3k for some integer k, and the product becomes:

(3k - 1)(3k)(3k + 1)

Here, 3k - 1 and 3k + 1 are two consecutive even numbers, so one of them is divisible by 4.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of the left-hand side of the equation. Since the three factors are consecutive, they share no common prime factors other than 1. Therefore, the prime factorization of the left-hand side will be the combined prime factorizations of each of the three factors.

For the equation to hold, the prime factorization of the left-hand side must be a perfect m-th power. This means that each prime in the factorization must appear to a power that is a multiple of m.

Since we have a sequence of three consecutive numbers, we can deduce that:

- If m is even, then a must be even because the product of three consecutive numbers includes an even number, and raising an odd number to an even power results in an odd number, which would contradict the presence of the even number in the product.
- If m is odd, then a can be either odd or even.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case where m = 2, which is the smallest possible value for m greater than 1. In this case, we are looking for a perfect square. The product of three consecutive integers can only be a perfect square if the middle number n is a perfect square itself, and the numbers n - 1 and n + 1 are both products of distinct prime numbers. This is a very restrictive condition and is not generally true for arbitrary n.

For larger values of m, the condition becomes even more restrictive, as we would need the product of three consecutive integers to be a perfect cube, perfect fourth power, etc.

Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that there is no straightforward method for finding all solutions for arbitrary m, we can conclude that the problem of finding all possible solutions to the equation (n - 1)n(n + 1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1 is non-trivial and may not have a general solution that can be expressed in a simple form.

However, we can identify some trivial solutions. For example, if n = 0 or n = 1, the left-hand side of the equation is 0, which is not a positive power of a positive integer a. If n = -1, the product is also 0. Therefore, these are not valid solutions.

For n = 2, we have:

(2 - 1) * 2 * (2 + 1) = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6

This is not a perfect power of an integer a &gt; 0 with m &gt; 1.

Without additional constraints or methods to narrow down the search, finding all possible solutions to the given equation is a highly non-trivial task that may require computational methods or deeper number-theoretic insights.</code></pre>
