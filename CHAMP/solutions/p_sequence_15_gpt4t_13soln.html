Does there exist a positive sequence {a_n}, such that both sum a_n and sum 1/(n^2*a_n) converge to finite values?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether such a sequence {a_n} exists, we need to consider the convergence of both series:

1. The series ∑ a_n
2. The series ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n)

For the first series to converge, the terms a_n must approach zero as n approaches infinity. This is a necessary condition for the convergence of a series with positive terms.

For the second series to converge, the terms 1/(n^2 * a_n) must also approach zero as n approaches infinity. However, since we are dividing by n^2, even if a_n does not approach zero very quickly, the division by n^2 could still make the terms of the second series approach zero fast enough for the series to converge.

The convergence of the second series can be analyzed using the comparison test. We know that the series ∑ 1/n^2 converges (it is a p-series with p = 2, which is greater than 1). If we can show that the terms of our second series are eventually smaller than the corresponding terms of the convergent p-series, then our second series will also converge.

Let&#x27;s assume that a_n is such that a_n &gt; 0 for all n and that ∑ a_n converges. Then, by the Cauchy condensation test, for the series ∑ a_n to converge, the terms a_n must eventually be decreasing and satisfy a_n = o(1/n) as n approaches infinity (i.e., a_n grows slower than 1/n).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the second series ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n). If a_n = o(1/n), then there exists some N such that for all n &gt; N, we have a_n &lt; 1/n. This implies that for n &gt; N:

1/(n^2 * a_n) &gt; 1/n^3

Since ∑ 1/n^3 is a convergent p-series (with p = 3 &gt; 1), the terms 1/(n^2 * a_n) are eventually larger than the terms of a convergent series, which suggests that ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n) may diverge.

However, we need to be careful here because the comparison test tells us that if the terms of one series are larger than the terms of a convergent series, we cannot conclude anything directly about the convergence of the first series. We need to find a series that is smaller than our second series and still converges to ensure that our second series converges.

Let&#x27;s refine our choice of a_n. If we choose a_n such that a_n = 1/n^(3/2), then a_n &gt; 0 and a_n approaches zero as n approaches infinity. Let&#x27;s check the convergence of both series with this choice:

1. The series ∑ a_n = ∑ 1/n^(3/2) is a p-series with p = 3/2, which is greater than 1, so this series converges.

2. The series ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n) = ∑ 1/(n^2 * 1/n^(3/2)) = ∑ 1/n^(1/2) is a p-series with p = 1/2, which is less than 1, so this series diverges.

Therefore, with this choice of a_n, while the first series converges, the second series diverges. We need to find a sequence {a_n} such that both series converge.

Let&#x27;s try another approach. Suppose we choose a_n = 1/n^p for some p &gt; 1. Then:

1. The series ∑ a_n = ∑ 1/n^p is a p-series and converges because p &gt; 1.

2. The series ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n) = ∑ 1/(n^2 * 1/n^p) = ∑ 1/n^(2-p) will converge if 2 - p &gt; 1, i.e., if p &lt; 1.

But we have a contradiction here because we need p to be both greater than 1 for the first series to converge and less than 1 for the second series to converge. Therefore, no such p exists, and thus no such sequence {a_n} exists where both series converge.

In conclusion, there does not exist a positive sequence {a_n} such that both ∑ a_n and ∑ 1/(n^2 * a_n) converge to finite values.</code></pre>
