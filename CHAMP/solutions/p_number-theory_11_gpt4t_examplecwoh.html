<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If ab | c, then a | c and b | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The statement &quot;If ab | c, then a | c and b | c&quot; is not generally true. The correct statement should be &quot;If ab | c, then a | c or b | c is not necessarily true, but if a and b are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), then a | c and b | c.&quot;

Let&#x27;s give an example where a and b are coprime:

Let a = 3, b = 4, and c = 12.

Since 3 and 4 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), we can check if both 3 and 4 divide 12.

Indeed, 3 | 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4, which is an integer.
And 4 | 12 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3, which is also an integer.

Since both a and b divide c, and ab (which is 3 × 4 = 12) also divides c, the statement holds true in this case.

However, if a and b are not coprime, it is not necessarily true that both a and b divide c. For example:

Let a = 6, b = 4, and c = 24.

Here, ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and indeed ab | c because 24 ÷ 24 = 1, which is an integer.

However, while it is true that 6 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 6 = 4) and 4 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 4 = 6), this does not always hold for non-coprime a and b. If we change c to 48, then:

ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and ab | 48 because 48 ÷ 24 = 2, which is an integer.

But if we take a = 6 and b = 4, they are not coprime (they share a common divisor of 2), and while it is still true that 6 | 48 and 4 | 48, if we had a different c where the common divisor of a and b does not divide c, the statement would not hold. For example, if c were 36, then ab = 24 does not divide 36, and while 6 divides 36, 4 does not.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If p is a prime and p | ab, then p | a or p | b (or both). More generally, if p | a_1*a_2*...*a_n, then p | a_i for at least one a_i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is known as Euclid&#x27;s lemma, which is a fundamental result in number theory. It states that if a prime number divides the product of two integers, it must divide at least one of those integers. More generally, if a prime number divides a product of several integers, it must divide at least one of those integers.

Let&#x27;s illustrate this with an example:

Let p = 5 (which is a prime number), and consider the product of two integers a = 6 and b = 10.

We have ab = 6 * 10 = 60.

Now, 5 | 60 because 60 ÷ 5 = 12, which is an integer.

According to Euclid&#x27;s lemma, since 5 is prime and it divides the product ab, it must divide at least one of a or b.

Checking a = 6, we see that 5 does not divide 6, since 6 ÷ 5 is not an integer.

Checking b = 10, we find that 5 does divide 10, since 10 ÷ 5 = 2, which is an integer.

So in this case, p (which is 5) divides b (which is 10), confirming Euclid&#x27;s lemma.

For the more general case, let&#x27;s consider p = 3 (a prime number) and the product of several integers a_1 = 4, a_2 = 5, a_3 = 6.

We have a_1 * a_2 * a_3 = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.

Now, 3 | 120 because 120 ÷ 3 = 40, which is an integer.

According to the general statement of Euclid&#x27;s lemma, since 3 divides the product a_1 * a_2 * a_3, it must divide at least one of the a_i.

Checking a_1 = 4, we see that 3 does not divide 4.
Checking a_2 = 5, we see that 3 does not divide 5.
Checking a_3 = 6, we find that 3 does divide 6, since 6 ÷ 3 = 2, which is an integer.

So in this case, p (which is 3) divides a_3 (which is 6), again confirming the general statement of Euclid&#x27;s lemma.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is related to the property of coprime integers and their divisors. If two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1, and if \( a \) divides the product \( bc \), then \( a \) must divide \( c \).

Let&#x27;s illustrate this with an example:

Let \( a = 7 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 3 \).

First, we check that \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime:
\( \text{gcd}(7, 5) = 1 \), since 7 and 5 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the product \( bc \):
\( bc = 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

We want to know if \( a \) divides \( bc \). In this case, \( a = 7 \) does not divide \( 15 \), so the condition \( a | bc \) is not satisfied, and we cannot conclude anything about \( a | c \) from this.

To apply the concept correctly, we need to ensure that \( a | bc \). Let&#x27;s modify \( c \) to make this true. Let&#x27;s take \( c = 14 \) instead.

Now, we have:
\( bc = 5 \times 14 = 70 \).

We can see that \( a = 7 \) divides \( bc = 70 \) because \( 70 \div 7 = 10 \), which is an integer.

Since \( a \) divides \( bc \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \), according to the concept, \( a \) must also divide \( c \). Indeed, \( a = 7 \) divides \( c = 14 \) because \( 14 \div 7 = 2 \), which is an integer.

Therefore, the example satisfies the concept: \( a | bc \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \) implies \( a | c \).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed as \( N \). We can express \( N \) as a two-part number consisting of its first digit and the remaining digits. Let the first digit be \( d \) (where \( 1 \leq d \leq 9 \), since it&#x27;s the first digit of a number and cannot be zero), and let the remaining part of the number be \( n \). Then \( N \) can be written as:

\[ N = 10^k \cdot d + n \]

where \( k \) is the number of digits in \( n \).

When the first digit is removed, we are left with \( n \), and the problem states that \( N \) is 57 times larger than \( n \):

\[ N = 57 \cdot n \]

Substituting the expression for \( N \) from above, we get:

\[ 10^k \cdot d + n = 57 \cdot n \]

Rearranging the terms to isolate \( n \), we have:

\[ 10^k \cdot d = 57 \cdot n - n \]
\[ 10^k \cdot d = (57 - 1) \cdot n \]
\[ 10^k \cdot d = 56 \cdot n \]

Since \( n \) is an integer and \( 56 \) is not a multiple of \( 10 \), \( n \) must contain the factor \( 56 \) in order for the left side of the equation to be an integer (as the left side is a multiple of \( 10^k \)). This means that \( n \) is a multiple of \( 56 \), and since we are looking for the smallest such \( N \), we should start with the smallest multiple of \( 56 \) that makes the left side a number with \( d \) as its first digit.

Let&#x27;s try \( n = 56 \) (the smallest multiple of 56) and see if it satisfies the equation:

\[ 10^k \cdot d = 56 \cdot 56 \]
\[ 10^k \cdot d = 3136 \]

Now, we need to find a \( k \) and a \( d \) such that \( 10^k \cdot d \) is equal to \( 3136 \). Since \( 3136 \) is a four-digit number, \( k \) must be 3 (because \( 10^k \) must shift the digit \( d \) to the thousands place).

So we have:

\[ 10^3 \cdot d = 3136 \]
\[ 1000 \cdot d = 3136 \]

Now, we divide both sides by 1000 to find \( d \):

\[ d = \frac{3136}{1000} \]

Since \( d \) must be an integer, and it&#x27;s the first digit of \( 3136 \), it&#x27;s clear that \( d = 3 \).

Now we can check if our \( n \) and \( d \) satisfy the original condition:

\[ N = 10^3 \cdot 3 + 56 \]
\[ N = 3000 + 56 \]
\[ N = 3056 \]

When we remove the first digit, we get \( n = 56 \), and indeed:

\[ 3056 = 57 \cdot 56 \]

So the smallest positive integer \( N \) that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed is \( \boxed{3056} \).</code></pre>
