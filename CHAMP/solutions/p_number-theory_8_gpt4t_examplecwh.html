If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is about the greatest common divisor (gcd), which is the largest positive integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. The statement you&#x27;ve provided is a property of gcd that can be understood through the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

Let&#x27;s take an example to illustrate the concept:

Let a = 5, b = 6, and c = 7.

First, we check that gcd(a, b) = gcd(5, 6) and gcd(a, c) = gcd(5, 7).

Since 5 is a prime number and neither 6 nor 7 is divisible by 5, it&#x27;s clear that gcd(5, 6) = 1 and gcd(5, 7) = 1.

Now, we consider bc, which is the product of b and c: bc = 6 * 7 = 42.

We need to show that gcd(a, bc) = gcd(5, 42) is also 1.

Since 42 is not divisible by 5 (as 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, and none of these prime factors is 5), the greatest common divisor of 5 and 42 is indeed 1.

Therefore, this example confirms the property: if gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is related to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely into prime factors, up to the order of the factors. The statement you&#x27;ve provided suggests that if a product of two coprime numbers (a and b) is a perfect k-th power (c^k), then each of the numbers must itself be a perfect k-th power.

Let&#x27;s consider an example where k = 2 (we&#x27;re dealing with squares):

Let ab = c^2 and gcd(a, b) = 1. We want to find a and b such that a = u^2 and b = v^2 for some u and v where gcd(u, v) = 1.

Let&#x27;s choose c = 10. Then c^2 = 100.

Now we need to find a and b such that ab = 100 and gcd(a, b) = 1.

One possible choice is a = 4 and b = 25, since 4 * 25 = 100.

Here, a = 4 is actually 2^2 and b = 25 is 5^2. We have u = 2 and v = 5.

We can check that gcd(u, v) = gcd(2, 5) = 1 (since 2 and 5 are prime and distinct) and that uv = 2 * 5 = 10, which is our original c.

So, in this example, we have demonstrated that if ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1, then it is indeed possible to express a and b as u^k and v^k respectively, where gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = c.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation you&#x27;ve provided is an identity known as the difference of squares. It states that the difference between the squares of two numbers, x and y, can be factored into the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example:

Let x = 7 and y = 3.

Now, we&#x27;ll compute x^2 - y^2 using the identity:

x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)

Plugging in our values for x and y, we get:

(7)^2 - (3)^2 = (7 + 3)(7 - 3)

Calculating each side separately, we have:

49 - 9 = (10)(4)

40 = 40

As you can see, the identity holds true, and we&#x27;ve shown that the difference of the squares of 7 and 3 is equal to the product of the sum of 7 and 3 and the difference of 7 and 3.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation you&#x27;ve provided is a generalization of the difference of squares to the difference of nth powers. It states that the difference between the nth powers of two numbers, x and y, can be factored into the product of (x - y) and a sum of terms where each term is a product of powers of x and y with the exponents adding up to n - 1.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example where n = 3:

Let x = 5 and y = 2.

Now, we&#x27;ll compute x^n - y^n using the identity:

x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^(n-1) + x^(n-2)*y + x^(n-3)*y^2 + ... + x^2*y^(n-3) + x*y^(n-2) + y^(n-1))

Plugging in our values for x, y, and n, we get:

5^3 - 2^3 = (5 - 2)(5^(3-1) + 5^(3-2)*2 + 2^(3-1))

Calculating each side separately, we have:

125 - 8 = (3)(25 + 5*2 + 4)

117 = 3(25 + 10 + 4)

117 = 3(39)

117 = 117

As you can see, the identity holds true, and we&#x27;ve shown that the difference of the cubes of 5 and 2 is equal to the product of the difference of 5 and 2 and the sum of the terms 5^2, 5*2, and 2^2.</code></pre>

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m represents the product of three consecutive integers, which is equal to a perfect m-th power for some positive integer a and m &gt; 1.

Let&#x27;s analyze the equation:

(n-1), n, and (n+1) are three consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, one must be divisible by 2, and one must be divisible by 3. Since they are consecutive, they are also coprime in pairs; that is, gcd(n-1, n) = gcd(n, n+1) = gcd(n-1, n+1) = 1.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the product of two of these terms and use the fact that they are coprime:

1. (n-1) and n+1 are always coprime because they differ by 2.
2. n and either (n-1) or (n+1) are coprime because n is between them.

Since (n-1) and (n+1) are coprime, their product must be a perfect m-th power if the entire product (n-1)n(n+1) is a perfect m-th power. Similarly, n must also be a perfect m-th power because it is coprime to (n-1)(n+1).

Let&#x27;s denote (n-1)(n+1) = b^m and n = c^m, where b and c are some positive integers and gcd(b, c) = 1.

Now, we have:

(n-1)(n+1) = (c^m - 1)(c^m + 1) = b^m

Since (c^m - 1) and (c^m + 1) are two consecutive even numbers, one of them is divisible by 2 and the other is divisible by 4. Therefore, the product is divisible by 8. Since they are also only 2 apart, they are coprime (their gcd is 1 or 2, but since one of them is divisible by 4 and the other is not, their gcd must be 2). This means that one of them must be a perfect m-th power, and the other must be twice a perfect m-th power.

However, the difference between two perfect m-th powers (where m &gt; 1) is always greater than 2 unless the powers are 0 and 1. Since we are looking for positive integer solutions, we can ignore the 0 power. The only time two perfect m-th powers differ by 2 is when they are 0^m and 1^m, but these are not positive integers greater than 1.

Therefore, the only solution occurs when c^m = n = 1, which gives us:

(n-1)n(n+1) = 0 * 1 * 2 = 0

But this does not satisfy the condition a &gt; 0 and m &gt; 1. Hence, there are no positive integer solutions for n, a, and m that satisfy the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for m &gt; 1.</code></pre>
