<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.

In simple terms, the rule of sum states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m + n ways to do either one of those things.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt or one pair of pants, you can use the rule of sum.

According to the rule of sum, you add the number of choices for each mutually exclusive event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 + 2 = 5.

To generalize the rule of sum, if you have k mutually exclusive events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the sum of all the options: m1 + m2 + m3 + ... + mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum assumes that the events or choices are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only choose one option from each event. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of product or inclusion-exclusion principle may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of sum is a fundamental principle in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.
2. Find f(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).
3. Find g(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of recursion and the given information to find the number of strings satisfying the given conditions.

Let&#x27;s define f(n) as the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) as the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.

From the given information, we can deduce the following relationships:

1. To find f(n+1), we can append a 1 to any valid string of length n that ends with either 2 or 3. Therefore, f(n+1) = g(n).

2. To find g(n+1), we can append either a 2 or a 3 to any valid string of length n. However, if the string ends with a 1, we cannot append a 1 again. Therefore, g(n+1) = f(n) + g(n).

Using these relationships, we can build a recursive formula to find the values of f(n) and g(n) for increasing values of n.

Let&#x27;s start with the base cases:

f(1) = 1 (since the only valid string of length 1 is &quot;1&quot;)
g(1) = 2 (since the valid strings of length 1 are &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;)

Now, let&#x27;s use the recursive formulas to find the values for higher values of n:

f(2) = g(1) = 2
g(2) = f(1) + g(1) = 1 + 2 = 3

f(3) = g(2) = 3
g(3) = f(2) + g(2) = 2 + 3 = 5

f(4) = g(3) = 5
g(4) = f(3) + g(3) = 3 + 5 = 8

f(5) = g(4) = 8
g(5) = f(4) + g(4) = 5 + 8 = 13

Therefore, the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2, and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors is given by f(5) + g(5) = 8 + 13 = 21.

So, the final answer is 21.</code></pre>
