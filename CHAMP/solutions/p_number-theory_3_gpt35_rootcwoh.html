An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all three-digit automorphic numbers.

You may find the following information useful:

1. If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all three-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers a such that a^2 ends in a.

Let&#x27;s consider a three-digit automorphic number a. We can write a as a = 100m + 10n + p, where m, n, and p are digits.

Now, let&#x27;s square a: a^2 = (100m + 10n + p)^2.

Since a is a three-digit number, we know that 100 ≤ a ≤ 999.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible values of p:

- If p = 0, then 210n^2 + 40np + p^2 = 210n^2, which is always greater than 999 for any value of n. Therefore, p cannot be 0.

- If p = 1, then 210n^2 + 40np + p^2 = 210n^2 + 40n + 1. We need this expression to be a three-digit number. Let&#x27;s solve the inequality: 100 ≤ 210n^2 + 40n + 1 ≤ 999.

Simplifying the inequality, we get: 99 ≤ 210n^2 + 40n ≤ 998.

Let&#x27;s solve the left inequality: 99 ≤ 210n^2 + 40</code></pre>
