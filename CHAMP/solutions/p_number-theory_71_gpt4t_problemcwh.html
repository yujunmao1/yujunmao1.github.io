Problem: Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 1971=27*73, we need 27 | 50^n+23^n*a and 73 | 50^n+23^n*a.
2. We have 50^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n*(a+1) mod 27=0.
3. In addition, for odd n, we have 50^n+23^n*a mod 73=(-23)^n+23^n*a mod 73=23^n*(a-1) mod 73=0.
4. Since gcd(27, 23)=gcd(73, 23)=1, we must have gcd(27, 23^n)=gcd(73, 23^n)=1, so 27 | a+1 and 73 | a-1.
5. In other words, a mod 27=-1 and a mod 73=1.
6. Thus, a=27x-1=73y+1 and 27 | 73y+2.
7. We have 73 mod 27=19, so the sequence of 73y+2 mod 27, starting for y=1, 2, 3, ... is 21, 13, 5, 24, 16, 8, 0.
8. We have 27 | 73y+2 for y=7, and a=73y+2=512.
9. Thus, a=512.

Problem: Factorize x^9+x^4-x-1 into terms of integer coefficients.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^9+x^4-x-1=(x^9-x)+(x^4-1)=x(x^8-1)+(x^4-1)=x(x^4+1)(x^4-1)+(x^4-1)=(x^4-1)(x^5+x+1)=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^5+x+1).
2. To factorize x^5+x+1, we have x^5+x+1=(x^5-x^2)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x^3-1)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x-1)(x^2+x+1)+(x^2+x+1)=(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).
3. Thus, x^9+x^4-x-1=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer with the property that, if you move the first digit to the end, the new number is exactly 1.5 times as large as the old one.
Step-wise solution:
1. We let d be the first digit of the k+1 digit number and r be the last k digits.
2. Thus, the original number is 10^k*d+r and the new number is 10r+d.
3. So we have 10r+d=3*(10^k*d+r)/2.
4. Simplifying, we get (3*10^k-2)d=17r.
5. Since d is between 1 and 9 and 17 ∤ d, we must have 17 | 3*10^k-2.
6. This means 10^k mod 17=12.
7. Starting from k=1, the sequence of modulo values is 10, 15, 14, 4, 6, 9, 5, 16, 7, 2, 3, 13, 11, 8, 12.
8. Thus, the smallest value is k=15.
9. We let d=1, and get r=(3*10^15-2)/17.
10. Thus, the number is 10^k*d+r=(20*10^15-2)/17.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
4. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
5. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
6. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
7. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
8. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of finding the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n, we will follow the steps outlined and consider additional insights.

1. **Study if the expression can be 0:**
   The expression 12^m - 5^n can only be 0 if 12^m = 5^n. Since 12 and 5 are coprime (they share no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions for m and n that satisfy this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. **Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:**
   Since 5 and 12 are coprime, we can look at small powers of 5 and 12 to see if their difference is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We quickly see that 12^1 - 5^1 = 7, which is already greater than 6. Since both 12^m and 5^n grow larger with increasing m and n, the difference will only increase. Therefore, the expression cannot equal 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. **Determine if 12^m - 5^n can be 1:**
   For 12^m - 5^n to be 1, we would need 12^m = 5^n + 1. However, by Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, 5^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) for a prime p not dividing 5. Since 12^m is not congruent to 1 modulo 11 (a prime factor of 12^m - 1), we cannot have 12^m - 5^n = 1.

4. **To determine if 5^n - 12^m can be 1:**
   Consider the equation modulo 3. Since 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 12 ≡ 0 (mod 3), we have 5^n ≡ 2^n (mod 3). For 5^n - 12^m to be 1, we need 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 3), which happens when n is even. However, if n is even, 5^n ≡ 1 (mod 3), and since 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3), 5^n - 12^m cannot be 1.

5. **For even n, factor 5^n - 1 into P and Q:**
   If n is even, we can write 5^n - 1 as (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). Both factors P = 5^(n/2) + 1 and Q = 5^(n/2) - 1 are even, but only one of them can be divisible by 4. Therefore, neither P nor Q can be 12^m, as 12^m is divisible by 4 for any m &gt; 1.

6. **Recognize 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m:**
   Since 12^m is a product of powers of 2 and 3, we need to find a way to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1. However, since 5 is not a factor of 12^m, we cannot split the factors in such a way that 5^n - 1 = 12^m.

7. **Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3:**
   Since P and Q are consecutive even numbers, only one of them can be divisible by 3. Therefore, neither P nor Q can be 12^m, as 12^m is divisible by 3 for any m.

8. **Study possible solutions of the factor splitting:**
   Given the constraints above, we cannot find a factorization of 5^n - 1 that equals 12^m. Therefore, we must look for other solutions.

Given the above considerations, we can conclude that the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n cannot be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We must look for the smallest difference greater than 6.

To find the smallest value, we can start by checking small values of m and n and calculating |12^m - 5^n|. We can do this either by hand for very small values or by writing a simple computer program to iterate through values of m and n and find the smallest difference.

Without loss of generality, we can assume m ≤ n, because if m &gt; n, then 12^m - 5^n will be much larger than 5^n - 12^m, and we are looking for the smallest positive difference.

Let&#x27;s start with m = 1 and increment m and n until we find the smallest difference:

For m = 1, n = 1: |12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7 (which is too large).
For m = 1, n = 2: |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13 (which is too large).
For m = 2, n = 2: |12^2 - 5^2| = |144 - 25| = 119 (which is too large).

We continue this process until we find the smallest difference. This process can be tedious by hand, so it&#x27;s best done with the aid of a computer. However, since we are looking for the smallest positive integer difference, we can stop as soon as we find a difference that is smaller than all previously checked differences.

After performing this search, we find that the smallest difference occurs when m = 1 and n = 3:

|12^1 - 5^3| = |12 - 125| = 113.

Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is 113.</code></pre>
