<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider an example where you have free time during the weekend and you want to choose an activity to do on Saturday. You have several options, but you can only do one activity due to time constraints.

Action 1: Watch a movie.
- You have 3 movies you&#x27;re interested in watching.

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.

Action 2: Read a book.
- You have 2 new books to choose from.

There are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.

Action 3: Go for a hike.
- There are 4 different trails nearby.

There are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

Action 4: Visit a friend.
- You have 5 friends you could potentially visit.

There are p_4 = 5 ways to perform the fourth action.

Since you can only choose one activity to do on Saturday, the total number of ways you can spend your time is the sum of the ways to perform each individual action:

Total number of ways to spend Saturday = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4
                                        = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5
                                        = 14

So, there are 14 different ways you could choose to spend your Saturday, given these activity options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. Insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points and study the formation of the group of k points.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars, which is a common combinatorial method to distribute indistinguishable items into distinguishable bins. In this case, we want to distribute n points (stars) into sequences (bins) such that one of the sequences contains exactly k points.

Let&#x27;s consider a row of n points (stars) and n-1 gaps between them. We want to place dividers (bars) into these gaps to create sequences of points. Since we want one of the sequences to contain exactly k points, we need to place two dividers around the group of k points to isolate it from the rest.

For example, if n = 10 and k = 3, one possible arrangement could be:

`* * * | * * | * * * *`

Here, the group of k = 3 points is isolated by dividers.

Since we have n-1 gaps and we need to place 2 dividers to isolate the group of k points, we have n-1-2 = n-3 gaps left where we can place the remaining dividers. The remaining points, which are n-k, can be distributed in any sequence, including before the first k group or after it.

Now, we need to determine how many ways we can place the remaining dividers. We have n-k points left to distribute, and we can place the remaining dividers in any of the n-3 gaps. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to partition n-k points into sequences using n-3 dividers.

Using the stars and bars method, the number of ways to place m dividers among n points is given by the binomial coefficient (n + m choose m). In our case, we have n-k stars and n-3-k bars, so the number of ways to place the dividers is:

(n - k + n - 3 - k choose n - 3 - k) = (2n - k - 3 choose n - 3 - k)

However, we must consider that the group of k points can appear anywhere in the sequence. It can be at the beginning, at the end, or anywhere in between the remaining points. Since we have n-k remaining points and we are placing n-3-k dividers, there are n-k-(n-3-k) = 3 sequences that can be formed. The group of k points can be in any of these 3 positions.

Therefore, the total number of times the number k appears in all sequences of positive integers that sum to n is:

3 * (2n - k - 3 choose n - 3 - k)

This is the final expression that represents how many times the number k appears among all sequences of positive integers that sum to n, for integer k &lt; n - 1.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number k appears \(3 \times \binom{2n - k - 3}{n - k - 1}\) times among all sequences of positive integers that sum to n, for integer k &lt; n - 1.</code></pre>
