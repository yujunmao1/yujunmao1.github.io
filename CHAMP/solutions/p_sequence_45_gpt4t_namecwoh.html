<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: cube of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The cube of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that express the cube of a sum or difference of two numbers in terms of the individual numbers and their powers. These formulas are useful for expanding expressions that involve cubed binomials.

The cube of sum formula is given by:

(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

This formula states that the cube of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the cube of the second number.

Similarly, the cube of difference formula is given by:

(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

This formula states that the cube of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the difference of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the negative of the cube of the second number.

Both formulas can be derived from the binomial theorem or by directly multiplying out the binomial (a + b) or (a - b) three times. They are particularly useful in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics where simplifying expressions involving cubes is necessary.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence {a_n} is defined by a_1=1, a_(n+1)=a_n+1/a_n^2. Do we have a_9000&gt;30?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence {a_n} defined by the recursive formula:

a_1 = 1
a_(n+1) = a_n + 1/a_n^2

We want to determine whether a_9000 &gt; 30. Let&#x27;s start by examining the first few terms of the sequence to get a sense of its behavior:

a_1 = 1
a_2 = a_1 + 1/a_1^2 = 1 + 1/1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2
a_3 = a_2 + 1/a_2^2 = 2 + 1/2^2 = 2 + 1/4 = 2.25
a_4 = a_3 + 1/a_3^2 = 2.25 + 1/2.25^2

We can see that each term is greater than the previous term since we are always adding a positive quantity (1/a_n^2) to the previous term. This means the sequence is strictly increasing.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the growth of the sequence. Notice that as n increases, the term 1/a_n^2 becomes smaller because a_n is increasing. This means that the amount by which each term increases over the previous term is decreasing. However, the sequence will still grow without bound because we are always adding a positive quantity.

To determine whether a_9000 &gt; 30, we don&#x27;t need to calculate all the terms up to a_9000. Instead, we can use the fact that the sequence is increasing and the growth rate is slowing down. If we can find a term a_k such that a_k &gt; 30, then we can conclude that a_9000 will also be greater than 30 because all subsequent terms will be greater as well.

Let&#x27;s estimate when the sequence might exceed 30. We can use the fact that each term is greater than the sum of all previous terms. This is because each term a_(n+1) is a_n plus something positive, and a_n is the sum of all previous terms plus something positive, and so on.

So, we have:

a_2 &gt; a_1
a_3 &gt; a_1 + a_2
a_4 &gt; a_1 + a_2 + a_3
...
a_n &gt; a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_(n-1)

Now, let&#x27;s use this inequality to estimate when the sequence might exceed 30. We can start by bounding the sum of the first few terms:

a_2 &gt; 1 (since a_1 = 1)
a_3 &gt; 1 + a_2 &gt; 1 + 1 = 2
a_4 &gt; 1 + a_2 + a_3 &gt; 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
a_5 &gt; 1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 &gt; 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8

We can see that the sum is doubling with each step, which suggests that the sequence is growing at least exponentially. If we continue this pattern, we can estimate that:

a_6 &gt; 16
a_7 &gt; 32

Since a_7 is already greater than 30, we can conclude that a_9000 will definitely be greater than 30. This is a very rough estimate, and the actual value of a_7 will be even larger because we&#x27;ve been underestimating each term. Therefore, we can confidently say that a_9000 &gt; 30 without having to compute the exact value of a_9000.</code></pre>
