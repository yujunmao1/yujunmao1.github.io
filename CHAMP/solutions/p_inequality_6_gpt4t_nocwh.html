<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let A=(1/2)*(3/4)*(5/6)*...*(99/100). Is A greater than 0.1?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Let B=(2/3)*(4/5)*...*(100/101) and study the expression AB.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s first calculate the expression for AB, where A and B are defined as follows:

A = (1/2) * (3/4) * (5/6) * ... * (99/100)
B = (2/3) * (4/5) * (6/7) * ... * (100/101)

Now, let&#x27;s multiply A and B term by term:

AB = [(1/2) * (2/3)] * [(3/4) * (4/5)] * [(5/6) * (6/7)] * ... * [(99/100) * (100/101)]

Notice that in each pair of terms, the numerator of the second fraction cancels out the denominator of the first fraction. Therefore, the product simplifies to:

AB = (1/3) * (1/5) * (1/7) * ... * (1/101)

Now, we have a product of fractions where the numerator is always 1 and the denominators are the odd numbers from 3 to 101. This product is clearly less than 1, as we are multiplying fractions that are all less than 1.

To determine if A is greater than 0.1, we need to compare AB with B. Since B is a product of fractions that are all slightly less than 1, B is also less than 1. However, B is clearly larger than AB because each term in B is larger than the corresponding term in AB (since the numerators in B are all 1 greater than the denominators, whereas in AB they are all 2 greater than the denominators).

Now, let&#x27;s estimate B. We can see that each term in B is slightly less than 1. For a rough estimate, let&#x27;s assume each term is about 0.99 (which is an underestimate). There are 50 terms in B, so we might estimate B as:

B â‰ˆ 0.99^50

This is a very rough estimate, but it&#x27;s enough to show that B is significantly less than 1. However, it&#x27;s not enough to determine if A is greater than 0.1. We need a better estimate.

Let&#x27;s look at the first few terms of B to get a better sense of its value:

B = (2/3) * (4/5) * (6/7) * ... * (100/101)

Notice that each term is the product of two consecutive integers divided by the square of the larger integer plus 1. For example, (2/3) is 2/(2+1), (4/5) is 4/(4+1), and so on. This means that each term is slightly less than 1, but not by much. The first term (2/3) is the smallest, and each subsequent term gets closer to 1.

Since B is a product of terms each slightly less than 1, and the terms are getting closer to 1 as we go, B is going to be somewhat close to 1, but we still don&#x27;t have a precise estimate.

To get a better estimate, we can use the fact that the harmonic mean of two numbers is less than or equal to the geometric mean, which is less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. In the case of each term in B, the two numbers are consecutive integers, so the arithmetic mean is just 1 more than the smaller integer, and the geometric mean is the square root of the product, which is the smaller integer plus 0.5.

So for each term in B, we have:

(smaller integer) / (smaller integer + 1) &lt; sqrt[(smaller integer) * (smaller integer + 1)] / (smaller integer + 1) &lt; (smaller integer + 0.5) / (smaller integer + 1)

Since the smaller integer divided by one more than the smaller integer is always greater than 0.5, we can say that each term in B is greater than 0.5. Therefore, B is greater than 0.5^50.

Now, 0.5^50 is a very small number (approximately 8.88 x 10^-16), so B is certainly much larger than this. This means that B is much closer to 1 than it is to 0.5^50.

Since AB is the product of terms that are all less than 1, and B is much closer to 1 than 0.5^50, we can conclude that A must be significantly greater than AB. Therefore, A is also significantly greater than 0.5^50, which is a very small number.

Given that B is less than 1 but not by a huge margin, and A is significantly greater than a very small number, it is reasonable to conclude that A is greater than 0.1. Without an exact calculation, we cannot say for sure, but the estimation strongly suggests that A &gt; 0.1.</code></pre>
