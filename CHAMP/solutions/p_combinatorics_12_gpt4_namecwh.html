<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination. 

The rule of product states that if there are &#x27;n&#x27; ways to do one thing, and &#x27;m&#x27; ways to do another thing, then there are n*m ways to do both. 

For example, if you have 3 shirts and 4 pants, then you have 3*4 = 12 different outfits you can wear. 

This rule is the basis for the concept of permutations and combinations, and is used in a wide range of mathematical and statistical applications. It&#x27;s also used in probability theory to calculate the total number of outcomes for independent events.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and it can be solved using the concept of derangements, which are permutations of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot. This means we now have n+1 parking lots.

2. The condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot is that no car i parks in its favorite lot a_i, because if it does, it will block all the cars that prefer lots after a_i from parking if their favorite lots are occupied. This is a derangement problem.

3. There are (n+1)! possible driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. 

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration. 

The number of derangements of a set of size n is usually denoted by D_n or !n, and it can be calculated using the formula:

D_n = n! (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)

So, the number of derangements of a set of size n+1 is D_(n+1).

However, because we are considering cyclic shifts, each derangement is counted n times (once for each possible starting position). Therefore, the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is D_(n+1) / n.

So, the final answer is (n+1)! / n * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^(n+1)/(n+1)!).</code></pre>
