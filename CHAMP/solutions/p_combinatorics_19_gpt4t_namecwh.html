<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
2. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
3. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are the same person, by first selecting the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number).
4. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are different people, by first selecting the president, then the secretary, and finally the rest of the committee (of any number).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will interpret the given expression combinatorially, as suggested in the problem statement. We want to find a closed-form formula for the sum:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot k^2 \]

Let&#x27;s break this down into two cases based on the roles of president and secretary within the committee:

**Case 1: The president and the secretary are the same person.**

In this case, we first choose 1 person to be both president and secretary, which can be done in \( C(n, 1) = n \) ways. Then, we choose the rest of the committee from the remaining \( n - 1 \) people. The size of the rest of the committee can range from 0 to \( n - 1 \), so the number of ways to form the rest of the committee is \( 2^{n-1} \) (since each of the remaining \( n - 1 \) people can either be on the committee or not).

The total number of ways for this case is then:

\[ n \cdot 2^{n-1} \]

**Case 2: The president and the secretary are different people.**

In this case, we first choose 1 person to be the president in \( C(n, 1) = n \) ways. Then we choose a different person to be the secretary, which can be done in \( C(n-1, 1) = n - 1 \) ways. Finally, we choose the rest of the committee from the remaining \( n - 2 \) people, which can be done in \( 2^{n-2} \) ways.

The total number of ways for this case is then:

\[ n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot 2^{n-2} \]

Now, we add the number of ways from both cases to get the total number of ways to form the committee with a president and a secretary:

\[ n \cdot 2^{n-1} + n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot 2^{n-2} \]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

\[ n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (2 + (n - 1)) \]
\[ = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (n + 1) \]

So the closed-form formula for the sum is:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot k^2 = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (n + 1) \]

This is the total number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from \( n \) people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.</code></pre>
