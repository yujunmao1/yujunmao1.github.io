The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example. 

Suppose you have a deck of 52 playing cards and you want to draw a hand of 5 cards. The order in which you draw the cards doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e., drawing a King first and then a Queen is the same as drawing a Queen first and then a King). 

The number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from (52 cards in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (5 cards in this case). 

So, the number of different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck is C(52, 5). 

Using the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, we find that C(52, 5) = 52! / [5!(52-5)!] = 2,598,960. 

So, there are 2,598,960 different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example.

Suppose you are a coach of a basketball team with 12 players. You need to select a starting lineup of 5 players. The order in which you select the players doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e., selecting player A first and then player B is the same as selecting player B first and then player A).

The number of ways to choose 5 players from 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, r), where n is the total number of items to choose from (12 players in this case) and r is the number of items to choose (5 players in this case).

So, the number of different starting lineups you can choose from a team of 12 players is C(12, 5).

Using the formula for combinations, which is C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!] = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-r+1)/r!, we find that C(12, 5) = 12*11*10*9*8 / 5*4*3*2*1 = 792.

So, there are 792 different starting lineups you can choose from a team of 12 players.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>First, let&#x27;s consider the total number of ways to arrange the 8 trees. Since there are 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees, and they are all distinguishable, we use the formula for permutations of a multiset: n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of items, and n1, n2, ..., nk are the numbers of each type of item. In this case, we have:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 560

Next, let&#x27;s consider the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other. We can think of the 5 non-apple trees and the spaces between them as slots where we can put the apple trees. There are 6 such slots (5 between the trees and 1 at each end), and we need to choose 3 of them for the apple trees. This is a combination, so we use the formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items to choose. In this case, we have:

Arrangements with no adjacent apple trees = C(6, 3) = 6! / [3!(6-3)!] = 20

However, we also need to consider the arrangements of the 5 non-apple trees. Since there are 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees, and they are all distinguishable, we use the formula for permutations of a multiset again:

Arrangements of non-apple trees = 5! / (3! * 2!) = 10

So, the total number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other is:

Total arrangements with no adjacent apple trees = 20 * 10 = 200

Finally, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is the number of such arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

Probability = 200 / 560 = 0.3571 (rounded to four decimal places)

So, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is approximately 0.3571, or 35.71%.</code></pre>
