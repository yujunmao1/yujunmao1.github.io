<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r ≠ 1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a≤b, define the sequence as a_1=a, a_2=b, a_(n+2)=(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2. Does the limit exist for this sequence, and if so, find it as an expression in terms of a and b.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If an (infinite) sequence converges to a limit, then all (infinite) subsequences converge, and converge to the same limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the limit exists for the sequence defined by \( a_1 = a \), \( a_2 = b \), and \( a_{n+2} = \frac{a_{n+1} + a_n}{2} \), we can first try to understand the behavior of the sequence.

Given the recursive formula, we can see that each term is the average of the two preceding terms. This means that if \( a \) and \( b \) are close to each other, subsequent terms will be even closer to each other, suggesting that the sequence might converge.

Let&#x27;s calculate the first few terms to get a sense of the sequence&#x27;s behavior:

- \( a_1 = a \)
- \( a_2 = b \)
- \( a_3 = \frac{a_2 + a_1}{2} = \frac{b + a}{2} \)
- \( a_4 = \frac{a_3 + a_2}{2} = \frac{\frac{b + a}{2} + b}{2} = \frac{a + 2b}{4} \)
- \( a_5 = \frac{a_4 + a_3}{2} = \frac{\frac{a + 2b}{4} + \frac{b + a}{2}}{2} = \frac{2a + 3b}{8} \)

We can see that each term is a weighted average of \( a \) and \( b \), with the weights being powers of \( \frac{1}{2} \). This suggests that as \( n \) increases, the influence of the initial difference between \( a \) and \( b \) diminishes, and the terms of the sequence get closer together.

To prove convergence and find the limit, let&#x27;s assume the sequence does converge to a limit \( L \). Then, according to the definition of the sequence, the limit must satisfy the same recurrence relation:

\( L = \frac{L + L}{2} \)

Solving for \( L \), we get:

\( 2L = 2L \)

This equation is true for any \( L \), which means that the limit is not determined by the recurrence relation alone. However, since the sequence is bounded (by \( a \) and \( b \)) and the terms get closer together, it does converge.

Now, let&#x27;s use the property that all subsequences of a convergent sequence converge to the same limit. We can look at the subsequences of even and odd terms:

- The subsequence of odd terms starts with \( a_1 = a \), \( a_3 = \frac{a + b}{2} \), \( a_5 = \frac{2a + 3b}{8} \), and so on.
- The subsequence of even terms starts with \( a_2 = b \), \( a_4 = \frac{a + 2b}{4} \), \( a_6 = \frac{3a + 5b}{16} \), and so on.

As \( n \) goes to infinity, the coefficients of \( a \) and \( b \) in both subsequences will approach each other because the difference between them is halved at each step. Therefore, both subsequences (and thus the entire sequence) must converge to the same limit, which is the average of \( a \) and \( b \):

\( L = \frac{a + b}{2} \)

So, the limit of the sequence exists and is \( \frac{a + b}{2} \), which is the average of the first two terms.</code></pre>
