<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Make the parking lot arrangement a circle, by connecting the n-th lot to a new (n+1)-th lot, which connects back to the 1st lot.
2. Thus, every car will have somewhere to park because there are n cars in the (n+1)-lot circle.
3. In addition, satisfying the original parking configuration is equivalent to the (n+1)-th lot being empty after all cars have parked (because an occupied (n+1)-th lot means that the car on that lot would have left for good originally).
4. Let each driver choose his favorite lot number from 1 to n+1, so there are (n+1)^n sequences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we need to find the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park.

From step 4 of the partial solution, we know that there are (n+1)^n possible sequences if we consider the (n+1)-th lot as well. However, not all of these sequences will satisfy the condition that every driver can park.

To determine the number of valid sequences, we need to consider the cases where the (n+1)-th lot is occupied and where it is empty.

Case 1: The (n+1)-th lot is occupied.
In this case, we need to find the number of sequences where all drivers can park except for the driver who would have parked in the (n+1)-th lot. This is equivalent to finding the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park in the first n lots, which is the original problem with n lots. Therefore, the number of sequences in this case is (n+1)^(n-1).

Case 2: The (n+1)-th lot is empty.
In this case, we need to find the number of sequences where every driver can park in the first n lots and the (n+1)-th lot remains empty. This is equivalent to finding the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park in the first n lots and the last driver parks in the (n+1)-th lot. Therefore, the number of sequences in this case is (n+1)^(n-1).

To find the total number of valid sequences, we sum the number of sequences from both cases:

Total number of valid sequences = (n+1)^(n-1) + (n+1)^(n-1) = 2 * (n+1)^(n-1)

Therefore, the final answer is 2 * (n+1)^(n-1).</code></pre>
