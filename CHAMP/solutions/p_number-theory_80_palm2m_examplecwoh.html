<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here are a few examples:

* 12 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 1+2=3, is divisible by 3.
* 15 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 1+5=6, is divisible by 3.
* 21 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 2+1=3, is divisible by 3.
* 30 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+0=3, is divisible by 3.
* 33 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+3=6, is divisible by 3.
* 36 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+6=9, is divisible by 3.
* 45 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 4+5=9, is divisible by 3.
* 54 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 5+4=9, is divisible by 3.
* 63 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 6+3=9, is divisible by 3.
* 72 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 7+2=9, is divisible by 3.
* 81 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 8+1=9, is divisible by 3.
* 90 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 9+0=9, is divisible by 3.
* 99 is a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 9+9=18, is divisible by 3.

On the other hand, here are a few examples of numbers that are not multiples of 3:

* 11 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 1+1=2, is not divisible by 3.
* 14 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 1+4=5, is not divisible by 3.
* 17 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 1+7=8, is not divisible by 3.
* 22 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 2+2=4, is not divisible by 3.
* 25 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 2+5=7, is not divisible by 3.
* 28 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 2+8=10, is not divisible by 3.
* 31 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+1=4, is not divisible by 3.
* 34 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+4=7, is not divisible by 3.
* 37 is not a multiple of 3 because its digit sum, 3+7=10, is not divisible by 3.

Can the digit sum of a perfect square be 1977?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>No, the digit sum of a perfect square cannot be 1977.

A perfect square is a number that can be obtained by squaring an integer. For example, 16 is a perfect square because it is equal to $4^2$.

The digit sum of a number is the sum of its digits. For example, the digit sum of 16 is 1+6=7.

The digit sum of a perfect square must be a multiple of 9. This is because the square of any integer ending in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9 will also end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9. The square of any integer ending in 2, 3, 7, or 8 will end in 6. And the square of any integer ending in 5 will end in 5.

Since 1977 is not a multiple of 9, it cannot be the digit sum of a perfect square.</code></pre>
