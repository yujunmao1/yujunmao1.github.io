<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are derived from the basic algebraic identities. They are used to simplify or solve expressions or equations. 

1. Square of Sum Formula: The square of the sum of two numbers (a and b) is equal to the square of the first number, plus twice the product of the two numbers, plus the square of the second number. Mathematically, it is represented as:

   (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

   For example, if a = 3 and b = 2, then (3 + 2)² = 3² + 2*(3*2) + 2² = 25.

2. Square of Difference Formula: The square of the difference of two numbers (a and b) is equal to the square of the first number, minus twice the product of the two numbers, plus the square of the second number. Mathematically, it is represented as:

   (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

   For example, if a = 5 and b = 3, then (5 - 3)² = 5² - 2*(5*3) + 3² = 4.

These formulas are fundamental in algebra and are often used in various mathematical calculations, including factoring, simplifying expressions, and solving equations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after reaching a certain value, called the modulus. It&#x27;s often used in computer science, cryptography, and in solving many types of mathematical problems. 

Here are the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

1. Addition: If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m). This means that if two numbers a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and two other numbers c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the sum of a and c will have the same remainder as the sum of b and d when divided by m.

2. Subtraction: If a ≡ b (mod m), then a - c ≡ b - c (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, then the difference between a and any number c will have the same remainder as the difference between b and c when divided by m.

3. Multiplication: If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then ac ≡ bd (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the product of a and c will have the same remainder as the product of b and d when divided by m.

4. Division: Division is more complicated in modular arithmetic and doesn&#x27;t always work in the same way as the other operations. In general, you can&#x27;t just divide both sides of a congruence by a number, unless you know that number is relatively prime to the modulus (i.e., the greatest common divisor of the number and the modulus is 1).

These rules make modular arithmetic a very powerful tool in number theory and other areas of mathematics.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 4?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For odd x, x^2 mod 8=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The problem is asking for the minimum number of integers x, y, z that must be divisible by 4 in the Pythagorean triple (x, y, z) where x^2 + y^2 = z^2.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible remainders when an integer is divided by 4:

- If an integer is divisible by 4, its square is also divisible by 4.
- If an integer has a remainder of 1 or 3 when divided by 4, its square has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
- If an integer has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, its square has a remainder of 4 when divided by 4, which is equivalent to 0 (i.e., it&#x27;s divisible by 4).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 in modulo 4:

- If x and y are both divisible by 4, then x^2 and y^2 are both divisible by 4, so z^2 (and hence z) must also be divisible by 4.
- If x is divisible by 4 and y has a remainder of 1 or 3 when divided by 4, then x^2 is divisible by 4 and y^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so z^2 (and hence z) must have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. This is not possible because the square of an integer can&#x27;t have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
- If x and y both have a remainder of 1 or 3 when divided by 4, then x^2 and y^2 both have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so z^2 (and hence z) must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. This is not possible because the square of an integer can&#x27;t have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.

So, the only way for x^2 + y^2 = z^2 to hold is for at least one of x, y, z to be divisible by 4. Therefore, the minimum number of the three numbers that must be divisible by 4 is 1.</code></pre>
