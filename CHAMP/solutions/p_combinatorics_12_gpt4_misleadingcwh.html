<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).
5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem can be solved using combinatorics and the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

This step is done to simplify the problem. Now, instead of considering a one-way street, we can consider a circular parking lot.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

The condition is that there should be no sequence of consecutive lots, all of which are preferred by drivers arriving later than the driver who prefers the first lot in the sequence. This is because if such a sequence exists, the driver who prefers the first lot in the sequence will not be able to park if all the lots in the sequence are occupied.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?

There are (n+1)^n total sequences. To find the number of sequences that satisfy the condition, we need to subtract the number of sequences that do not satisfy the condition.

4. C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).

This is the formula for combinations, which will be used in the next step.

5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the number of sequences that do not satisfy the condition. For each k from 1 to n, we count the number of sequences where a sequence of k consecutive lots is preferred by drivers arriving later than the driver who prefers the first lot in the sequence. This number is C(n, k) * k! * (n+1-k)^(n-k) * n.

By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the total number of sequences that do not satisfy the condition is the sum of these counts for odd k, minus the sum of these counts for even k.

Therefore, the number of sequences that satisfy the condition is (n+1)^n - (sum for odd k of C(n, k) * k! * (n+1-k)^(n-k) * n) + (sum for even k of C(n, k) * k! * (n+1-k)^(n-k) * n).

Finally, since each sequence {a} has n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is this number divided by n.

So, the final answer is ((n+1)^n - (sum for odd k of C(n, k) * k! * (n+1-k)^(n-k) * n) + (sum for even k of C(n, k) * k! * (n+1-k)^(n-k) * n)) / n.</code></pre>
