<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving counting books on a bookshelf.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with several rows of books, and you want to count the total number of books. However, instead of counting each book once, you decide to count each book three times (perhaps to triple-check your count).

After going through the counting process, you find that you have counted a total of n = 90 counts. Since you counted each book d = 3 times, you want to find out the actual number of books on the shelf.

According to the concept, to find the actual number of books, you would divide the total number of counts by the number of times you counted each book:

Number of books = n / d
                = 90 / 3
                = 30

So, there are 30 books on the bookshelf.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving choosing an elective course for a semester at a university.

Suppose a student can choose one elective course for the upcoming semester, and there are three different departments offering elective courses, but the student can only enroll in one course due to a time conflict (no two courses can be taken at the same time).

Department A offers 4 different courses.
Department B offers 3 different courses.
Department C offers 2 different courses.

Here, each department represents an action (choosing a course from a department), and the number of courses offered by each department represents the number of ways to perform that action.

So, we have:
- p_1 = 4 ways to choose a course from Department A.
- p_2 = 3 ways to choose a course from Department B.
- p_3 = 2 ways to choose a course from Department C.

Since the student can only choose one course and the courses are offered at the same time (no two actions can be performed simultaneously), the total number of ways the student can choose an elective course is the sum of the ways to choose a course from each department:

Total number of ways to choose an elective course = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
                                                   = 4 + 3 + 2
                                                   = 9

Therefore, the student has 9 different elective courses to choose from in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of distinct colorings of a cube up to rotation. This means that two colorings are considered the same if one can be rotated to look exactly like the other.

A cube has 6 faces, and if each face is painted a different color, we have 6 choices for the first face, 5 choices for the second face (since one color has already been used), 4 choices for the third face, and so on, until we have only 1 choice for the last face. This gives us a total of 6! (6 factorial) ways to color the cube if we don&#x27;t consider rotations:

Total colorings without considering rotations = 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

However, we need to account for the fact that the cube can be rotated. The rotations of a cube can be broken down into the following categories:

1. Identity rotation (keeping the cube as is): 1 way
2. Rotations about an axis that goes through the centers of two opposite faces: There are 3 such axes (since there are 3 pairs of opposite faces), and for each axis, there are 3 possible rotations (90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees), giving us 3 axes × 3 rotations = 9 ways.
3. Rotations about an axis that goes through the midpoints of two opposite edges: There are 6 such axes (since there are 6 pairs of opposite edges), and for each axis, there are 2 possible rotations (180 degrees in either direction), giving us 6 axes × 2 rotations = 12 ways.
4. Rotations about an axis that goes through two opposite vertices (diagonals of the cube): There are 4 such axes (since there are 4 long diagonals in a cube), and for each axis, there are 2 possible rotations (120 degrees and 240 degrees), giving us 4 axes × 2 rotations = 8 ways.

Adding these up, we get the total number of distinct rotations of the cube:

Total rotations = 1 (identity) + 9 (face-centered) + 12 (edge-centered) + 8 (vertex-centered) = 30

Now, each distinct coloring of the cube can be rotated into 30 different positions (including the original position). Therefore, the number of distinct colorings up to rotation is the total number of colorings without considering rotations divided by the number of rotations:

Distinct colorings up to rotation = Total colorings without considering rotations / Total rotations
                                 = 720 / 30
                                 = 24

So, there are 24 distinct colorings of a cube when each face is painted a different color, considering rotations.</code></pre>
