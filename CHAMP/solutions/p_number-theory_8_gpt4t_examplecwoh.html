If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is about the greatest common divisor (gcd), which is the largest positive integer that divides two numbers without leaving a remainder. The statement you&#x27;ve provided is a property of gcd that can be understood through the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.

Let&#x27;s take an example to illustrate the concept:

Let a = 5, b = 6, and c = 7.

First, we check that gcd(a, b) = gcd(5, 6) and gcd(a, c) = gcd(5, 7).

Since 5 is a prime number and neither 6 nor 7 is divisible by 5, it&#x27;s clear that gcd(5, 6) = 1 and gcd(5, 7) = 1.

Now, we consider bc, which is the product of b and c: bc = 6 * 7 = 42.

We need to show that gcd(a, bc) = gcd(5, 42) is also 1.

Since 42 is not divisible by 5 (as 42 = 2 * 3 * 7, and none of these prime factors is 5), the greatest common divisor of 5 and 42 is indeed 1.

Therefore, this example confirms the property: if gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is related to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be factored uniquely into prime factors, up to the order of the factors. The statement you&#x27;ve provided suggests that if a product of two coprime numbers (a and b) is a perfect k-th power (c^k), then each of the numbers must itself be a perfect k-th power.

Let&#x27;s consider an example where k = 2 (we&#x27;re dealing with squares):

Let ab = c^2 and gcd(a, b) = 1. We want to find a and b such that a = u^2 and b = v^2 for some u and v where gcd(u, v) = 1.

Let&#x27;s choose c = 10. Then c^2 = 100.

Now we need to find a and b such that ab = 100 and gcd(a, b) = 1.

One possible choice is a = 4 and b = 25, since 4 * 25 = 100.

Here, a = 4 is actually 2^2 and b = 25 is 5^2. We have u = 2 and v = 5.

We can check that gcd(u, v) = gcd(2, 5) = 1 (since 2 and 5 are prime and distinct) and that uv = 2 * 5 = 10, which is our original c.

So, in this example, we have demonstrated that if ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1, then it is indeed possible to express a and b as u^k and v^k respectively, where gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = c.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation you&#x27;ve provided is an identity known as the difference of squares. It states that the difference between the squares of two numbers, x and y, can be factored into the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example:

Let x = 7 and y = 3.

Now, we&#x27;ll compute x^2 - y^2 using the identity:

x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)

Plugging in our values for x and y, we get:

(7)^2 - (3)^2 = (7 + 3)(7 - 3)

Calculating each side separately, we have:

49 - 9 = (10)(4)

40 = 40

As you can see, the identity holds true, and we&#x27;ve shown that the difference of the squares of 7 and 3 is equal to the product of the sum of 7 and 3 and the difference of 7 and 3.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation you&#x27;ve provided is a generalization of the difference of squares to the difference of nth powers. It states that the difference between the nth powers of two numbers, x and y, can be factored into the product of (x - y) and a sum of terms where each term is a product of powers of x and y with the exponents adding up to n - 1.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example where n = 3:

Let x = 5 and y = 2.

Now, we&#x27;ll compute x^n - y^n using the identity:

x^n - y^n = (x - y)(x^(n-1) + x^(n-2)*y + x^(n-3)*y^2 + ... + x^2*y^(n-3) + x*y^(n-2) + y^(n-1))

Plugging in our values for x, y, and n, we get:

5^3 - 2^3 = (5 - 2)(5^(3-1) + 5^(3-2)*2 + 2^(3-1))

Calculating each side separately, we have:

125 - 8 = (3)(25 + 5*2 + 4)

117 = 3(25 + 10 + 4)

117 = 3(39)

117 = 117

As you can see, the identity holds true, and we&#x27;ve shown that the difference of the cubes of 5 and 2 is equal to the product of the difference of 5 and 2 and the sum of the terms 5^2, 5*2, and 2^2.</code></pre>

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m represents the product of three consecutive integers equal to a perfect m-th power. Since n-1, n, and n+1 are consecutive integers, we know that they are coprime (no two consecutive integers share a common factor greater than 1). This is important because it implies that each of the factors must itself be a perfect m-th power or a product of perfect m-th powers.

Let&#x27;s analyze the equation:

(n-1)n(n+1) = a^m

We have three cases to consider based on the value of m:

1. If m = 2 (a perfect square), then we have a Pythagorean triplet (n-1, n, n+1), which is not possible because there is no Pythagorean triplet consisting of three consecutive integers.

2. If m &gt; 2 and is even, then each of the factors (n-1), n, and (n+1) must be even powers themselves. However, since they are consecutive integers, one of them must be even, and the other two must be odd, which contradicts the requirement that each must be an even power.

3. If m is odd, then we can have one of the factors being an odd power and the other two being 1 (since 1 is the m-th power of 1 for any m). This is the only possibility that can satisfy the equation given the constraints.

Given that m is odd, let&#x27;s consider the possible values for n-1, n, and n+1:

- If n is a perfect m-th power, then n-1 and n+1 cannot be perfect m-th powers since they are consecutive integers and differ from n by 1.
- If n-1 is a perfect m-th power, then n cannot be a perfect m-th power, and n+1 can only be a perfect m-th power if n-1 = 1 (since the difference between two perfect m-th powers greater than 1 is more than 1).
- If n+1 is a perfect m-th power, then n cannot be a perfect m-th power, and n-1 can only be a perfect m-th power if n+1 = 1, which is not possible for positive n.

Therefore, the only solution occurs when n-1 = 1, which implies n = 2 and n+1 = 3. This gives us:

1 * 2 * 3 = a^m

6 = a^m

The only m-th power of a positive integer a that equals 6 is 6 itself, which is 6^1. However, m must be greater than 1 by the problem&#x27;s constraints, so there is no solution for a^m that equals 6 with m &gt; 1.

In conclusion, there are no integer values of n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1 that satisfy the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m.</code></pre>
