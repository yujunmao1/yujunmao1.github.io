<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>In mathematics, a combination is a way of selecting items from a group, such that the order in which the items are selected does not matter. The number of combinations of $n$ items taken $r$ at a time is denoted by $C_n^r$ and is given by the following formula:

$$C_n^r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$, which is defined as $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$.

For example, the number of combinations of 5 items taken 3 at a time is $C_5^3 = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = 10$. This is because there are 10 ways to choose 3 items from a group of 5, such as {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {1, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, and {3, 4, 5}.

The combination formula can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange items in a row or the number of ways to choose a committee from a group of people.

Here are some examples of how the combination formula can be used:

* How many ways are there to arrange 5 people in a row?

There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange 5 people in a row. This is because there are 5 choices for the first person in line, 4 choices for the second person, 3 choices for the third person, 2 choices for the fourth person, and 1 choice for the fifth person.

* How many ways are there to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people?

There are $C_5^3 = 10$ ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people. This is because there are 5 choices for the first person on the committee, 4 choices for the second person, and 3 choices for the third person. However, we need to divide this number by 3!, since the order in which the people are chosen does not matter. This is because if we choose person 1, then person 2, and then person 3, this is the same committee as choosing person 2, then person 3, and then person 1.

* How many ways are there to arrange 5 people in a row so that person 1 is always in the first position?

There are 5 ways to arrange 5 people in a row so that person 1 is always in the first position. This is because there is only one choice for the first person in line, and then we can choose any of the remaining 4 people for the second position, any of the remaining 3 people for the third position, and so on.

* How many ways are there to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people so that person 1 is always on the committee?

There are 10 ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people so that person 1 is always on the committee. This is because we can choose person 1 for the committee in 5 ways, and then we can choose any of the remaining 4 people for the second position. For the third position, we only have 3 choices left, since person 1 cannot be chosen again.

The combination formula is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is important to understand how to use the formula correctly, so that you can get the correct answer to your problem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.
2. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
3. C(n, k)=C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs is $C_{8}^{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = 56$. This is because there are 8 choices for the first dog to get a cookie, 7 choices for the second dog, and 6 choices for the third dog. However, we need to divide this number by 3!, since the order in which the dogs are chosen does not matter. This is because if we choose dog 1, then dog 2, and then dog 3, this is the same distribution as choosing dog 2, then dog 3, and then dog 1.

However, this is not the correct answer, since it does not account for the possibility that a dog gets more than one cookie. To account for this, we need to consider the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs, such that no dog gets more than one cookie. This can be done by using the following formula:

$$C_{8}^{3} - C_{8}^{2} - C_{8}^{1} + C_{8}^{0} = 56 - 28 - 8 + 1 = 19$$

This is because there are 8 choices for the first dog to get a cookie, 7 choices for the second dog, and 6 choices for the third dog, if no dog gets more than one cookie. However, we need to subtract the number of ways to distribute 2 cookies to 8 dogs, since this would count each dog getting 2 cookies twice. We also need to subtract the number of ways to distribute 1 cookie to 8 dogs, since this would count each dog getting 1 cookie twice. Finally, we need to subtract the number of ways to distribute 0 cookies to 8 dogs, since this would count each dog getting 0 cookies twice.

The final answer is 19, since this is the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs, such that no dog gets more than one cookie.</code></pre>
