If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all three-digit automorphic numbers.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the last three digit of a^2-a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all three-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last three digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a three-digit number \( abc \) (where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \)).

The square of \( a \) can be written as \( a^2 = 1000k + abc \) for some integer \( k \), because the last three digits of \( a^2 \) must be \( abc \), and the remaining digits are some multiple of 1000.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the last three digits of \( a^2 - a \). This subtraction will remove the last three digits \( abc \) from \( a^2 \), leaving us with \( 1000k \). Therefore, \( a^2 - a \) must be divisible by 1000 for \( a \) to be an automorphic number.

Let&#x27;s write \( a \) as \( 100a + 10b + c \) and calculate \( a^2 - a \):

\( a^2 - a = (100a + 10b + c)^2 - (100a + 10b + c) \)

Expanding the square and subtracting \( a \), we get:

\( a^2 - a = 10000a^2 + 2000ab + 200ac + 100b^2 + 20bc + c^2 - 100a - 10b - c \)

Now, we only care about the last three digits, so we can ignore the terms that are multiples of 1000. This leaves us with:

\( a^2 - a = 200ac + 100b^2 + 20bc + c^2 - 100a - 10b - c \)

Simplifying and keeping only the last three digits, we get:

\( a^2 - a = 200ac + 100b(b - 1) + 20bc + c(c - 1) \)

For \( a^2 - a \) to be divisible by 1000, the expression above must be divisible by 1000. This means that:

1. \( c(c - 1) \) must be divisible by 10, which implies that \( c \) must be 0 or 1 because only 0 and 1, when squared, give a last digit of themselves.
2. If \( c = 0 \), then \( a^2 - a \) simplifies to \( 100b(b - 1) \), which is always divisible by 1000 for any digit \( b \).
3. If \( c = 1 \), then \( a^2 - a \) simplifies to \( 200a + 100b(b - 1) + 20b \), and this must be divisible by 1000.

Let&#x27;s consider each case:

Case 1: \( c = 0 \)
In this case, any three-digit number \( ab0 \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits will be automorphic because \( a^2 - a \) will be divisible by 1000.

Case 2: \( c = 1 \)
We need to find \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( 200a + 100b(b - 1) + 20b \) is divisible by 1000. Since \( 200a \) is always divisible by 1000 for any digit \( a \), we only need to worry about \( 100b(b - 1) + 20b \). This simplifies to \( 20b(5b - 5 + 1) \), or \( 20b(5b - 4) \). For this to be divisible by 1000, \( b(5b - 4) \) must be divisible by 50. Since \( b \) is a digit, the only value that works is \( b = 0 \) (because \( 5b - 4 \) can never be a multiple of 50 for \( b = 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \)).

Therefore, the only three-digit automorphic numbers are those of the form \( ab0 \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are any digits, and \( a1 \) where \( a \) is any digit and \( b = 0 \). This gives us the following automorphic numbers:

100, 101, 110, 111, ..., 190, 191, 200, 201, ..., 990, 991

In total, there are 90 automorphic numbers (10 for each hundred, from 100 to 900, plus one more for each hundred from 101 to 991).</code></pre>
