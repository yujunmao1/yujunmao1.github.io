<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the effect of the sequence of steps on the state of the lamps. Let&#x27;s consider the sequence of steps and the rules given:

1. If L_(j-1) is ON, then S_j will toggle the state of L_j.
2. If L_(j-1) is OFF, then S_j will leave the state of L_j unchanged.

We need to determine for which values of n the sequence of steps will never return all lamps to the ON state.

Let&#x27;s start by considering small values of n to see if we can find a pattern:

For n = 2:
- Initially, both L_0 and L_1 are ON.
- S_0 toggles L_0 (since L_1 is ON), so L_0 is now OFF and L_1 is ON.
- S_1 does not change L_1 (since L_0 is OFF), so L_0 is OFF and L_1 is ON.
- S_2 (which is the same as S_0) does not change L_0 (since L_1 is ON), so L_0 remains OFF and L_1 remains ON.
- We can see that we will never return to the state where both lamps are ON.

For n = 3:
- Initially, L_0, L_1, and L_2 are ON.
- S_0 toggles L_0, so L_0 is now OFF, L_1 and L_2 are ON.
- S_1 toggles L_1 (since L_0 is OFF), so L_0 is OFF, L_1 is OFF, and L_2 is ON.
- S_2 does not change L_2 (since L_1 is OFF), so L_0 is OFF, L_1 is OFF, and L_2 is ON.
- S_3 (which is the same as S_0) does not change L_0 (since L_2 is ON), so L_0 remains OFF, L_1 remains OFF, and L_2 remains ON.
- Again, we will never return to the state where all lamps are ON.

For n = 4:
- Initially, all lamps are ON.
- S_0 toggles L_0, so L_0 is now OFF, and the others are ON.
- S_1 toggles L_1, so L_0 is OFF, L_1 is OFF, and the others are ON.
- S_2 toggles L_2, so L_0 is OFF, L_1 is OFF, L_2 is OFF, and L_3 is ON.
- S_3 toggles L_3, so all lamps are now OFF.
- S_4 (which is the same as S_0) does not change L_0 (since L_3 is OFF), so all lamps remain OFF.
- However, now that all lamps are OFF, no further steps will change any lamp&#x27;s state, so we are stuck in this configuration.

From these examples, we can see that for n = 2 and n = 3, we never return to the state where all lamps are ON, and for n = 4, we end up in a state where all lamps are OFF and no further changes occur.

Let&#x27;s generalize this for any n &gt; 1:

- On the first pass (steps S_0 to S_(n-1)), we will toggle each lamp except for the last one, L_(n-1), because L_(n-2) will be OFF when we reach step S_(n-1).
- After the first pass, L_0 to L_(n-2) will be OFF, and L_(n-1) will be ON.
- On the second pass, no lamps will change state because each S_j will find L_(j-1) to be OFF.
- Therefore, we are left with L_0 to L_(n-2) OFF and L_(n-1) ON, and no further changes will occur.

This means that for any n &gt; 1, we will never be able to return all lamps to the ON state after the sequence of steps has been carried out. The only exception is when n = 1, which is not considered in this problem since we are looking at n in {2, 3, ..., 100}.

Thus, for all n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again. The answer is 99, since it includes all integers from 2 to 100.</code></pre>
