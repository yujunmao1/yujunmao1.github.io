<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Polynomial division is a process similar to long division for numbers, but it is used to divide one polynomial by another. The goal of polynomial division is to determine how many times the divisor polynomial can &quot;fit&quot; into the dividend polynomial, and to find the remainder if the division is not exact.

Here&#x27;s the definition and a brief explanation of the terms involved:

**Dividend**: The polynomial that is being divided. This is analogous to the number you start with in numerical long division.

**Divisor**: The polynomial by which you are dividing the dividend. In numerical division, this would be the number you divide by.

**Quotient**: The result of the division, representing how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend without considering the remainder.

**Remainder**: The part of the dividend that is left over after the division process has been completed. If the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor, the division process is complete.

The process of polynomial division can be done using long division or synthetic division (which is a shortcut method applicable when the divisor is a binomial of the form x - c).

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step outline of the long division process for polynomials:

1. Arrange both the dividend and the divisor polynomials in descending order of their degrees (the highest power of x comes first).

2. Divide the leading term (the term with the highest power of x) of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This gives you the first term of the quotient.

3. Multiply the entire divisor by the term you just found and subtract the result from the dividend. This gives you a new polynomial.

4. Repeat the process using the new polynomial as the dividend. Divide the leading term of the new polynomial by the leading term of the divisor to find the next term of the quotient.

5. Continue this process until the degree of the remainder polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor or until the remainder is zero.

6. The final quotient and remainder give you the result of the division, which can be expressed as:

   Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

For example, if we want to divide the polynomial 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 by x - 2, we would use polynomial long division to find that the quotient is 2x^2 + 7x + 13 and the remainder is 21. So, the division can be expressed as:

   2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 = (x - 2)(2x^2 + 7x + 13) + 21

Polynomial division is useful in various areas of algebra, including simplifying rational expressions, finding polynomial roots, and solving polynomial equations.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The cube of a sum and the cube of a difference are algebraic identities that describe the expansion of the cube of a binomial expression, whether it is a sum (a + b) or a difference (a - b). These formulas are useful for simplifying expressions and solving equations.

Here are the formulas:

**Cube of a Sum**:
(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

**Cube of a Difference**:
(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

Let&#x27;s break down each formula:

**Cube of a Sum**:
When you expand (a + b)³, you are essentially multiplying (a + b) by itself three times:
(a + b)³ = (a + b)(a + b)(a + b)

To expand this, you would typically perform the multiplication step by step, first multiplying two of the binomials and then multiplying the result by the third binomial. However, the cube of a sum formula gives you a shortcut to directly write down the expanded form without going through the multiplication steps. The formula shows that the expanded form consists of the cube of the first term (a³), three times the product of the square of the first term and the second term (3a²b), three times the product of the first term and the square of the second term (3ab²), and the cube of the second term (b³).

**Cube of a Difference**:
Similarly, when you expand (a - b)³, you are multiplying (a - b) by itself three times:
(a - b)³ = (a - b)(a - b)(a - b)

Again, the cube of a difference formula provides a shortcut to the expanded form. It consists of the cube of the first term (a³), minus three times the product of the square of the first term and the second term (3a²b), plus three times the product of the first term and the square of the second term (3ab²), and minus the cube of the second term (b³).

Notice that the cube of a sum and the cube of a difference formulas are very similar, with the only difference being the signs of the second and fourth terms. The cube of a sum has all positive terms, while the cube of a difference alternates signs, starting with a positive term.

These formulas are part of the larger set of binomial theorems and are particularly useful in higher algebra for simplifying expressions and solving equations where such cubic terms appear.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: sum and difference of cubes formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The sum and difference of cubes formulas are algebraic identities that provide a way to factor the sum or difference of two cube terms. These formulas are particularly useful because unlike the square of a sum or difference, the cube of a sum or difference does not result in a simple binomial expression. Instead, each cube can be factored into a product of a binomial and a trinomial.

Here are the formulas:

**Sum of Cubes**:
a³ + b³ = (a + b)(a² - ab + b²)

**Difference of Cubes**:
a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

Let&#x27;s break down each formula:

**Sum of Cubes**:
The sum of cubes formula shows that when you have the sum of two cubed terms, you can factor it into the product of a binomial (a + b) and a trinomial (a² - ab + b²). The binomial consists of the cube roots of the original terms, and the trinomial is composed of the square of the first term (a²), minus the product of the two terms (ab), plus the square of the second term (b²).

For example, if you have the expression x³ + 8, you can recognize that 8 is 2³, and thus factor the expression as:
x³ + 8 = x³ + 2³ = (x + 2)(x² - 2x + 4)

**Difference of Cubes**:
The difference of cubes formula is similar to the sum of cubes formula but is used when you have the difference between two cubed terms. It factors into the product of a binomial (a - b) and a trinomial (a² + ab + b²). The binomial consists of the cube roots of the original terms with a minus sign between them, and the trinomial is composed of the square of the first term (a²), plus the product of the two terms (ab), plus the square of the second term (b²).

For example, if you have the expression x³ - 27, you can recognize that 27 is 3³, and thus factor the expression as:
x³ - 27 = x³ - 3³ = (x - 3)(x² + 3x + 9)

These formulas are very useful in algebra for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and integrating or differentiating functions that involve cubic terms. They are also a good example of how recognizing patterns in algebra can lead to simplifications that might not be immediately obvious.</code></pre>

For what value(s) of k is x^3+y^3+z^3+kxyz divisible by x+y+z?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the value(s) of \( k \) such that the expression \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + kxyz \) is divisible by \( x + y + z \). We can use the sum of cubes formula to help us with this.

First, let&#x27;s recall the sum of cubes formula:
\[ a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc) \]

If we compare this to our given expression, we can see that if \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + kxyz \) is to be divisible by \( x + y + z \), we need to have:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz) \]

This means that for the expression to be divisible by \( x + y + z \), we need \( kxyz \) to be equal to \( -3xyz \), which implies that \( k = -3 \).

So, for \( k = -3 \), the expression \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + kxyz \) becomes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \]
\[ = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz) \]

This confirms that the expression is divisible by \( x + y + z \) when \( k = -3 \).

Therefore, the value of \( k \) for which \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + kxyz \) is divisible by \( x + y + z \) is \( k = -3 \).</code></pre>
