<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>In mathematics, a combination is a way of selecting items from a group, such that the order in which the items are selected does not matter. The number of combinations of $n$ items taken $r$ at a time is denoted by $C_n^r$ and is given by the following formula:

$$C_n^r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$

where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$, which is defined as $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$.

For example, the number of combinations of 5 items taken 3 at a time is $C_5^3 = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = 10$. This is because there are 10 ways to choose 3 items from a group of 5, such as {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 5}, {1, 3, 4}, {1, 3, 5}, {1, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 4}, {2, 3, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, and {3, 4, 5}.

The combination formula can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as counting the number of ways to arrange items in a row or the number of ways to choose a committee from a group of people.

Here are some examples of how the combination formula can be used:

* How many ways are there to arrange 5 people in a row?

There are 5! = 120 ways to arrange 5 people in a row. This is because there are 5 choices for the first person in line, 4 choices for the second person, 3 choices for the third person, 2 choices for the fourth person, and 1 choice for the fifth person.

* How many ways are there to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people?

There are $C_5^3 = 10$ ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people. This is because there are 5 choices for the first person on the committee, 4 choices for the second person, and 3 choices for the third person. However, we need to divide this number by 3!, since the order in which the people are chosen does not matter. This is because if we choose person 1, then person 2, and then person 3, this is the same committee as choosing person 2, then person 3, and then person 1.

* How many ways are there to arrange 5 people in a row so that person 1 is always in the first position?

There are 5 ways to arrange 5 people in a row so that person 1 is always in the first position. This is because there is only one choice for the first person in line, and then we can choose any of the remaining 4 people for the second position, any of the remaining 3 people for the third position, and so on.

* How many ways are there to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people so that person 1 is always on the committee?

There are 10 ways to choose a committee of 3 people from a group of 5 people so that person 1 is always on the committee. This is because we can choose person 1 for the committee in 5 ways, and then we can choose any of the remaining 4 people for the second position. For the third position, we only have 3 choices left, since person 1 cannot be chosen again.

The combination formula is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is important to understand how to use the formula correctly, so that you can get the correct answer to your problem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.
3. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The total number of ways to plant the trees is $8!$, since there are 8 trees and the order matters.

To count the number of ways to plant the trees so that no two apple trees are next to each other, we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and the 5 other trees as indistinguishable. This gives us 6 indistinguishable objects. We can then place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends of the row of 6 objects. This gives us $6!$ ways to do this.

However, some of these arrangements will have two apple trees next to each other. To count the number of these arrangements, we can consider the 3 apple trees as a single object. This gives us 5 indistinguishable objects. We can then place 2 dividers in between and/or at the two ends of the row of 5 objects. This gives us $5!$ ways to do this.

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is $\frac{6! - 3!}{8!} = \boxed{\frac{1}{120}}$.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the solution:

We can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and the 5 other trees as indistinguishable. This gives us 6 indistinguishable objects. We can then place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends of the row of 6 objects. This gives us $6!$ ways to do this.

For example, one possible arrangement is to place the dividers after the first, third, and fifth objects. This would give the following arrangement of trees:

* Apple * Peach * Cherry * Apple * Peach * Cherry

Another possible arrangement is to place the dividers after the first, second, and fourth objects. This would give the following arrangement of trees:

* Apple * Peach * Apple * Cherry * Peach * Cherry

However, some of these arrangements will have two apple trees next to each other. To count the number of these arrangements, we can consider the 3 apple trees as a single object. This gives us 5 indistinguishable objects. We can then place 2 dividers in between and/or at the two ends of the row of 5 objects. This gives us $5!$ ways to do this.

For example, one possible arrangement is to place the dividers after the first and third objects. This would give the following arrangement of trees:

* Apple * Apple * Peach * Cherry * Peach

Another possible arrangement is to place the dividers after the second and fourth objects. This would give the following arrangement of trees:

* Apple * Peach * Apple * Cherry * Peach

Therefore, the number of arrangements in which no two apple trees are next to each other is $6! - 3! = 720 - 60 = \boxed{660}$.

The total number of ways to plant the trees is $8!$, since there are 8 trees and the order matters. Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is $\frac{660}{8!} = \boxed{\frac{1}{120}}$.</code></pre>
