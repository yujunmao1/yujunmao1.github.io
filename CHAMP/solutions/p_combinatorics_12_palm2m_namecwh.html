<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We can solve this problem by converting the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot. This is equivalent to saying that the first driver can park in any lot, the second driver can park in any lot except the first, the third driver can park in any lot except the first two, and so on.

Now, we can establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot. This condition is that the sequence of parking lots chosen by the drivers must be a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n+1.

Next, we consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. There are $\binom{n+1}{n}$ of these sequences.

For each sequence $\\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\\}$, consider its $n$ cyclically shifted versions (including itself). These are the sequences $\\{a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n, a_1\\}$, $\\{a_3, a_4, \ldots, a_n, a_2, a_1\\}$, and so on. For each of these sequences, we can check whether it is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n+1. If it is, then it corresponds to a valid parking configuration.

We can see that there are $n$ cyclically shifted versions of each sequence, so there are a total of $n \binom{n+1}{n}$ sequences that correspond to valid parking configurations.

Therefore, the number of sequences $\\{a_1, \ldots, a_n\\}$ such that every driver can park is $\boxed{n \binom{n+1}{n}}$.</code></pre>
