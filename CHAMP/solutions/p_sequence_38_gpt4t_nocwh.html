<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The terms of the sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... are all positive, and a_(n+1)=sqrt(1+a_n) for all n. Does there exist such a sequence with all a_n being rational numbers, and if so, find the smallest possible value of a_1 such that the sequence satisfies the condition.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Assume that each a_n is rational and write a_n=p_n/q_n with gcd(p_n, q_n)=1.
2. From a_(n+1)^2=1+a_n, study the relationship between q_n and q_(n+1).
3. Establish a stronger condition on the sequence of numbers.
4. Study possible valid values for a_1 under this stronger condition by looking at the expression a_(n+1)^2-a_n^2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s start by assuming that each term \( a_n \) is rational and can be written as \( a_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n} \) where \( p_n \) and \( q_n \) are integers with \( \gcd(p_n, q_n) = 1 \). This means that \( p_n \) and \( q_n \) are coprime.

Given the recursive formula \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we can square both sides to obtain:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + a_n \]

Substituting \( a_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n} \) into the equation, we get:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + \frac{p_n}{q_n} = \frac{p_n + q_n}{q_n} \]

Since \( a_{n+1} \) is also rational, we can write \( a_{n+1} = \frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}} \) where \( p_{n+1} \) and \( q_{n+1} \) are also coprime. Squaring this, we get:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = \left(\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}\right)^2 = \frac{p_{n+1}^2}{q_{n+1}^2} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( a_{n+1}^2 \), we have:

\[ \frac{p_{n+1}^2}{q_{n+1}^2} = \frac{p_n + q_n}{q_n} \]

This implies that:

\[ p_{n+1}^2 = p_n + q_n \]
\[ q_{n+1}^2 = q_n \]

Since \( q_n \) divides \( q_{n+1}^2 \) and \( q_n \) and \( q_{n+1} \) are coprime, it must be the case that \( q_n = 1 \) for all \( n \). This means that each \( a_n \) must be an integer.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the expression \( a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 \):

\[ a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = (a_{n+1} + a_n)(a_{n+1} - a_n) \]

Since \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we have:

\[ a_{n+1} - a_n = \sqrt{1 + a_n} - a_n \]
\[ a_{n+1} + a_n = \sqrt{1 + a_n} + a_n \]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = (\sqrt{1 + a_n} + a_n)(\sqrt{1 + a_n} - a_n) \]
\[ a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = 1 \]

This means that the difference between the squares of consecutive terms is always 1. Since \( a_n \) is an integer, this implies that \( a_n \) and \( a_{n+1} \) are consecutive integers.

The smallest possible value for \( a_1 \) that satisfies this condition is 0, because if \( a_1 \) were negative, \( a_2 \) would not be defined (as the square root of a negative number is not a real number). However, the terms of the sequence are all positive, so \( a_1 \) cannot be 0.

The next smallest possible value for \( a_1 \) is 1. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

\[ a_1 = 1 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{2} \]

Since \( \sqrt{2} \) is not a rational number, \( a_1 = 1 \) does not lead to a sequence of rational numbers.

The next smallest possible value for \( a_1 \) is 2. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

\[ a_1 = 2 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{3} \]

Again, \( \sqrt{3} \) is not a rational number, so \( a_1 = 2 \) does not work either.

The next smallest possible value for \( a_1 \) is 3. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

\[ a_1 = 3 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \]
\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + a_2} = \sqrt{3} \]

We encounter the same problem as before with \( \sqrt{3} \) not being rational.

Continuing this process, we find that \( a_1 = 4 \) gives:

\[ a_1 = 4 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{5} \]

Which is also not rational. However, if we try \( a_1 = 9 \), we get:

\[ a_1 = 9 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{10} \]

Which is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that \( a_2 \) is also a perfect square. The next perfect square after 9 is 16. Let&#x27;s try that:

\[ a_1 = 16 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{17} \]

Which is not rational. The next perfect square after 16 is 25. Let&#x27;s try that:

\[ a_1 = 25 \]

Which is not rational. The next perfect square after 961 is 1024. Let&#x27;s try that:

\[ a_1 = 1024 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1025} \]

Here, we have a rational number because \( \sqrt{1025} = \sqrt{25 \times 41} = 5\sqrt{41} \), which is not a rational number. The next perfect square after 1024 is 1089. Let&#x27;s try that:
