<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 7 rectangle with 2 x 1 and 2 x 2 tiles.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is one way to solve the problem:

We can think of the problem as follows. We have a 2 x 7 rectangle, and we want to fill it with 2 x 1 and 2 x 2 tiles. The 2 x 1 tiles can be placed in any of the 7 rows, and the 2 x 2 tiles can be placed in any of the 2 columns. So, there are $7 \times 2 = 14$ ways to place the tiles.

However, we need to be careful. Some of these ways will not result in a valid tiling. For example, if we place a 2 x 1 tile in the first row and a 2 x 2 tile in the second row, the 2 x 2 tile will not cover the entire row. So, we need to remove these invalid tilings from our count.

To do this, we can think of each 2 x 2 tile as a &quot;wall&quot;. The walls can be placed in any of the 2 columns, and they can be placed in any order. So, there are $2! = 2$ ways to place the walls.

Now, we can count the number of valid tilings. For each way to place the walls, we can place the 2 x 1 tiles in any of the 7 rows that are not blocked by the walls. So, there are $7$ ways to place the 2 x 1 tiles for each way to place the walls.

Therefore, the total number of valid tilings is $2 \times 7 = 14$.

Another way to solve the problem is to use a recurrence relation. Let $f(n)$ be the number of ways to fill a $2 \times n$ rectangle with 2 x 1 and 2 x 2 tiles. Then, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$f(n) = 2f(n-1) + 7$$

where the base case is $f(1) = 1$.

To see why this is true, note that there are $2f(n-1)$ ways to fill the first $n-1$ rows of the rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles, and then there is one way to fill the last row with a 2 x 2 tile. There are also $7$ ways to fill the first $n-1$ rows with 2 x 2 tiles, and then there are $2$ ways to fill the last row with 2 x 1 tiles.

We can solve this recurrence relation using the method of undetermined coefficients. The general solution to the recurrence relation is $f(n) = A + Bn + Cn^2$. The initial condition $f(1) = 1$ gives us the equation $A + B + C = 1$. The first derivative of the recurrence relation is $f&#x27;(n) = 2B + 2Cn$. The initial condition $f&#x27;(1) = 2$ gives us the equation $2B + 2C = 2$. The second derivative of the recurrence relation is $f&#x27;&#x27;(n) = 2C$. The initial condition $f&#x27;&#x27;(1) = 0$ gives us the equation $2C = 0$.

Solving the system of equations $A + B + C = 1$, $2B + 2C = 2$, and $2C = 0$, we find that $A = 1$, $B = 0$, and $C = -1$. Therefore, the solution to the recurrence relation is $f(n) = 1 - n$.

Therefore, the number of ways to fill a 2 x 7 rectangle with 2 x 1 and 2 x 2 tiles is $f(7) = 1 - 7 = -6$.</code></pre>
