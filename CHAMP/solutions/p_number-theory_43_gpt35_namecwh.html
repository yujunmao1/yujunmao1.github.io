<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 3 states that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In other words, if you add up all the digits of a number and the resulting sum is divisible by 3, then the original number is also divisible by 3.

For example, let&#x27;s consider the number 246. The sum of its digits is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 246 is also divisible by 3.

Similarly, let&#x27;s take the number 1,287. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1,287 is also divisible by 3.

This rule can be applied to larger numbers as well. For instance, let&#x27;s consider the number 12,345. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 12,345 is also divisible by 3.

The divisibility rule for 3 is a helpful tool to quickly determine if a number is divisible by 3 without performing the actual division. It can be particularly useful when dealing with larger numbers or when performing mental calculations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, named after the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat. It provides a relationship between prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

The theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any positive integer not divisible by p, then the remainder when a^p is divided by p is always equal to a raised to the power of (p-1) modulo p. In mathematical notation, it can be written as:

a^p ≡ a (mod p)

Here, the symbol &quot;≡&quot; denotes congruence, meaning that the two numbers have the same remainder when divided by p.

To understand this theorem, let&#x27;s consider an example. Let&#x27;s take the prime number p = 5 and the positive integer a = 2. According to Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, we have:

2^5 ≡ 2 (mod 5)

If we calculate 2^5, we get 32. When we divide 32 by 5, the remainder is 2. Therefore, the congruence holds true.

Fermat&#x27;s little theorem has several important applications in number theory and cryptography. One application is in the field of modular exponentiation, where it allows for efficient computation of large powers of numbers modulo a prime. It is also used in the field of primality testing, where it helps identify prime numbers.

Overall, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is a powerful result that provides insights into the behavior of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?
2. Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?
3. Starting with a prime p, would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?
4. If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if there can be finitely many composite numbers in the given sequence, let&#x27;s analyze the information provided.

1. Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?
A number is composite if it is divisible by a number other than 1 and itself. Therefore, appending a digit that results in a number divisible by a prime number greater than 8 would immediately produce a composite number. The prime numbers greater than 8 are 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc. So, appending digits that result in numbers divisible by any of these primes would produce composite numbers.

2. Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, appending digits that result in a sum of digits divisible by 3 would produce a multiple of 3. The digits that would produce a sum of digits divisible by 3 are 3, 6, and 9. So, appending these digits periodically would result in multiples of 3.

3. Starting with a prime p, would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?
If we start with a prime number p and append only the digit 3, we can observe that the resulting numbers would be of the form p3, p33, p333, p3333, etc. Since p is a prime number, it is relatively prime to 3 (gcd(p, 3) = 1). According to the given information (point 4), if a number a divides the product of two numbers b and c, and a is relatively prime to b, then a divides c. In this case, a = p and b = 3. Therefore, p divides the number formed by appending only digit 3. However, it is important to note that this does not guarantee that the resulting numbers will always be composite. It is possible that some of the numbers formed by appending only digit 3 could be prime.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that there can be infinitely many composite numbers in the given sequence. This is because we can always append digits that result in composite numbers (point 1), and we can also periodically append digits that result in multiples of 3 (point 2). Therefore, there is no limit to the number of composite numbers that can be formed in this sequence.</code></pre>
