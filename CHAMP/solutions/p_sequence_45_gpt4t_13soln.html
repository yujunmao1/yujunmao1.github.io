<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence {a_n} is defined by a_1=1, a_(n+1)=a_n+1/a_n^2. Do we have a_9000&gt;30?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We have a_2^3=(1+1)^3=8&gt;3*2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence {a_n} as n increases. We are given that a_1 = 1 and the recursive formula for the sequence is:

a_(n+1) = a_n + 1/a_n^2.

We want to determine if a_9000 &gt; 30. Let&#x27;s first try to understand how the sequence grows.

From the recursive formula, we can see that each term is greater than the previous term since we are adding a positive quantity (1/a_n^2) to the previous term. This means the sequence is strictly increasing.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the growth rate of the sequence. The growth rate is determined by the term 1/a_n^2. As n increases, a_n increases, which means that 1/a_n^2 decreases. This suggests that the growth rate of the sequence is slowing down as n gets larger.

However, we need to establish a more concrete understanding of the growth to determine if a_9000 &gt; 30. Let&#x27;s try to find a pattern or inequality that can help us estimate the growth of the sequence.

We are given a partial solution that states a_2^3 = (1 + 1)^3 = 8 &gt; 3*2. This suggests that we might want to look at the cubes of the terms in the sequence. Let&#x27;s investigate the cubes of the first few terms to see if we can find a pattern:

a_1 = 1, so a_1^3 = 1^3 = 1.
a_2 = a_1 + 1/a_1^2 = 1 + 1/1^2 = 2, so a_2^3 = 2^3 = 8.

Now let&#x27;s look at a_3:

a_3 = a_2 + 1/a_2^2 = 2 + 1/2^2 = 2 + 1/4 = 2.25.

We can&#x27;t immediately see a pattern, but let&#x27;s try to establish an inequality for a_n^3. We know that a_2^3 &gt; 3*2. Let&#x27;s assume that for some k, a_k^3 &gt; 3k holds true. Now we want to see if a_(k+1)^3 &gt; 3(k+1).

a_(k+1) = a_k + 1/a_k^2.

Now let&#x27;s cube both sides:

a_(k+1)^3 = (a_k + 1/a_k^2)^3.

We want to show that this is greater than 3(k+1). Expanding the right side using the binomial theorem is complex, but we can use the fact that (x + y)^3 &gt; x^3 + y^3 when x, y &gt; 0 (since we would be ignoring the positive 3x^2y + 3xy^2 terms).

So we have:

a_(k+1)^3 &gt; a_k^3 + (1/a_k^2)^3.

By our inductive hypothesis, a_k^3 &gt; 3k, and we can see that (1/a_k^2)^3 = 1/a_k^6. Now, we need to show that:

3k + 1/a_k^6 &gt; 3(k+1).

This simplifies to:

1/a_k^6 &gt; 3.

Since a_k is increasing and a_2 = 2, we know that a_k ≥ 2 for all k ≥ 2. Therefore:

1/a_k^6 ≤ 1/2^6 = 1/64.

This is not greater than 3, so our inductive step fails here. We cannot conclude that a_n^3 &gt; 3n for all n using this approach.

We need to find a different approach to estimate the growth of the sequence. Let&#x27;s try to establish a lower bound for a_n that grows sufficiently fast to determine if a_9000 &gt; 30.

Since the sequence is strictly increasing, we know that a_n &gt; 1 for all n &gt; 1. This means that the term we add each time, 1/a_n^2, is less than 1. So the sequence grows by less than 1 each time. However, this is not enough to determine the value of a_9000.

Let&#x27;s try to establish a stronger lower bound. We know that:

a_(n+1) = a_n + 1/a_n^2 &gt; a_n.

Let&#x27;s try to compare a_n to some function that we can more easily analyze. For example, let&#x27;s compare it to the sequence b_n defined by b_1 = 1 and b_(n+1) = b_n + 1/b_n. This is similar to our original sequence, but without squaring the denominator.

We can see that a_n &gt; b_n for all n because 1/a_n^2 &gt; 1/a_n (since a_n &gt; 1). Now, if we can show that b_9000 &gt; 30, then it would follow that a_9000 &gt; 30.

The sequence b_n is known as the sequence of &quot;silver means&quot; and it is known to grow quadratically. In fact, b_n is approximately n^2/2 for large n. Therefore, b_9000 is approximately (9000)^2/2 = 81,000,000/2 = 40,500,000, which is much greater than 30.

Since a_n &gt; b_n for all n, we can conclude that a_9000 &gt; b_9000 &gt; 30.

Therefore, a_9000 &gt; 30.</code></pre>
