<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider the task of getting dressed in the morning. 

1. First step is to put on underwear. Let&#x27;s say you have 5 pairs of underwear to choose from. So, p_1 = 5.

2. Second step is to put on a shirt. You have 7 shirts in your wardrobe. So, p_2 = 7.

3. Third step is to put on pants. You have 3 pairs of pants. So, p_3 = 3.

4. Fourth step is to put on socks. You have 4 pairs of socks. So, p_4 = 4.

5. Fifth step is to put on shoes. You have 2 pairs of shoes. So, p_5 = 2.

According to the concept, the total number of ways to get dressed (assuming you wear one of each item) is p_1*p_2*p_3*p_4*p_5 = 5*7*3*4*2 = 840 ways. 

So, you could potentially go 840 days without repeating the exact same outfit!</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and it&#x27;s solved using the concept of derangements, which are permutations of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot. This means we now have n+1 parking lots.

2. The condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot is that no car i parks in its favorite lot a_i. This is because if a car parks in its favorite lot, it could potentially block a later car from parking if all succeeding lots are occupied.

3. There are (n+1)^n possible driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. However, we need to exclude those sequences where a car parks in its favorite lot. The number of such sequences is given by the number of derangements of n+1 elements, which is approximately (n+1)!/e, where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial and &quot;e&quot; is the base of the natural logarithm.

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself). On average, exactly one of these will be a valid parking configuration. This is because the sequence and its shifts form a group under cyclic permutation, and the action of this group on the set of all sequences is transitive and regular. Therefore, each orbit (set of sequences that can be obtained from one another by cyclic shifts) contains exactly one valid parking configuration.

Putting it all together, the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is approximately (n+1)^n / e / n. This is an approximation because the number of derangements of n+1 elements is not exactly (n+1)!/e, but this is the closest integer to it.</code></pre>
