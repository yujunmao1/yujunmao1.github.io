For integer n, n^2 mod 3 is either 0 or 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is that when you square an integer and then take the modulus with respect to 3, the result is always either 0 or 1. This is because all integers can be classified into one of three categories based on their remainder when divided by 3: they are congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 3.

Here&#x27;s how it works for each category:

1. If n is divisible by 3 (n ≡ 0 (mod 3)), then n^2 will also be divisible by 3. For example, let&#x27;s take n = 6, which is divisible by 3. Then n^2 = 6^2 = 36. When you take 36 mod 3, the result is 0 because 36 is divisible by 3.

2. If n has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (n ≡ 1 (mod 3)), then n^2 will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. For example, let&#x27;s take n = 4, which gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Then n^2 = 4^2 = 16. When you take 16 mod 3, the result is 1 because 16 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

3. If n has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 (n ≡ 2 (mod 3)), then n^2 will be congruent to 4 mod 3, which simplifies to 1 because 4 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. For example, let&#x27;s take n = 5, which gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. Then n^2 = 5^2 = 25. When you take 25 mod 3, the result is 1 because 25 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

So, no matter what integer n you choose, n^2 mod 3 will always be either 0 or 1. This is a direct consequence of the fact that (3k + r)^2 = 9k^2 + 6kr + r^2, and since 9k^2 and 6kr are always divisible by 3, the remainder when divided by 3 depends only on r^2, where r is either 0, 1, or 2. Since 0^2 = 0, 1^2 = 1, and 2^2 = 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3), the result is as stated.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For prime number p and integer a, n, if p | a^n, then p | a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a fundamental result in number theory, often used in the context of prime factorization and modular arithmetic. It states that if a prime number \( p \) divides \( a^n \) (where \( a \) is an integer and \( n \) is a positive integer), then \( p \) must also divide \( a \). This is because prime numbers have the property that if they divide a product, they must divide at least one of the factors.

Here&#x27;s an example applying this concept:

Let&#x27;s take \( p = 5 \) (which is a prime number) and consider the integer \( a \) and the exponent \( n = 3 \). Suppose we know that \( 5 \) divides \( a^3 \), i.e., \( 5 | a^3 \).

According to the concept, since \( 5 \) is prime and \( 5 | a^3 \), it must be the case that \( 5 | a \). To illustrate this with a specific example, let&#x27;s say \( a^3 = 125 \). We can see that \( 125 = 5^3 \), and thus \( 5 | 125 \). Since \( 125 = a^3 \), we can deduce that \( a = 5 \), and clearly, \( 5 | 5 \).

This property is very useful in proving various results in number theory, such as in the proof of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem or in simplifying expressions under modular arithmetic. It is a direct consequence of the definition of prime numbers, which are numbers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and themselves.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer-valued solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 3?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the concept that for any integer \( n \), \( n^2 \mod 3 \) is either 0 or 1. This is because if \( n \) is divisible by 3, then \( n^2 \) will also be divisible by 3, and if \( n \) is not divisible by 3, then \( n^2 \) will leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.

Given the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \), we want to determine how many of the numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) must be divisible by 3.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible remainders when \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are divided by 3:

1. If \( x \) and \( y \) are both not divisible by 3, then \( x^2 \mod 3 = 1 \) and \( y^2 \mod 3 = 1 \). Adding these together, we get \( x^2 + y^2 \mod 3 = 1 + 1 = 2 \). However, \( z^2 \mod 3 \) can only be 0 or 1, so it cannot be 2. This means that it&#x27;s not possible for both \( x \) and \( y \) to be not divisible by 3.

2. If one of \( x \) or \( y \) is divisible by 3, without loss of generality, let&#x27;s say \( x \) is divisible by 3, then \( x^2 \) will also be divisible by 3, and \( x^2 \mod 3 = 0 \). If \( y \) is not divisible by 3, then \( y^2 \mod 3 = 1 \). Adding these together, we get \( x^2 + y^2 \mod 3 = 0 + 1 = 1 \). For this to be equal to \( z^2 \mod 3 \), \( z^2 \) must also leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, which means \( z \) is not divisible by 3.

3. If both \( x \) and \( y \) are divisible by 3, then \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) will also be divisible by 3, and \( x^2 + y^2 \mod 3 = 0 + 0 = 0 \). This means that \( z^2 \) must also be divisible by 3, and hence \( z \) must be divisible by 3.

From the above cases, we can see that it is not possible for both \( x \) and \( y \) to be not divisible by 3. Therefore, at least one of \( x \), \( y \), or \( z \) must be divisible by 3. However, if either \( x \) or \( y \) is divisible by 3, then \( z \) must also be divisible by 3 because the sum of a multiple of 3 and a non-multiple of 3 cannot be a multiple of 3. Therefore, at least two of the numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) must be divisible by 3.

In conclusion, at least two of the three numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) must be divisible by 3 in any integer-valued solution to the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = z^2 \).</code></pre>
