Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. Insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points and study the formation of the group of k points.
3. If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.
4. If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to n and contain the number k at least once. We can use a combinatorial approach to solve this problem.

First, let&#x27;s consider a sequence of positive integers that sum to n and contain the number k. We can think of this as a sequence of n points, with n-1 gaps between them. We want to place dividers in these gaps to create groups that represent the numbers in our sequence.

Since we want the number k to appear in our sequence, we can start by creating a group of k points. There are n-k points left to distribute among the other groups. We need to place dividers to create these groups.

Now, we can think of the remaining n-k points as a sequence that needs to be partitioned into positive integer groups. This is equivalent to the number of ways to partition n-k points into a sequence of positive integers, which is the same as the number of ways to place dividers in the n-k-1 gaps between these points.

However, we need to consider that the group of k points can appear anywhere in the sequence. This means we can place the group of k points in any of the gaps between the remaining n-k points or at the beginning or end of the sequence. There are (n-k) + 1 positions where the group of k points can be placed.

To find the number of ways to place the dividers for the remaining n-k points, we use the &quot;stars and bars&quot; combinatorial method. We have n-k stars (points) and we want to divide them into groups with bars (dividers). The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient:

C(n-k-1 + r - 1, r - 1)

where r is the number of groups we want to form. Since we don&#x27;t have a fixed number of groups, we consider the case where we have at least one group (since we already have the group of k points). This means r can range from 1 to n-k, so we need to sum over all possible values of r:

Sum_{r=1}^{n-k} C(n-k-1 + r - 1, r - 1)

This sum represents the number of ways to partition the remaining n-k points into positive integer groups, considering all possible numbers of groups.

Finally, we multiply this sum by the number of positions where the group of k points can be placed, which is (n-k) + 1:

(n-k + 1) * Sum_{r=1}^{n-k} C(n-k-1 + r - 1, r - 1)

This expression gives us the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to n and contain the number k at least once.

However, this problem is quite complex and the above expression might not simplify easily. A more straightforward approach might involve generating functions or a recursive method to count the sequences, but the problem as stated seems to require a closed-form expression, which is not trivial to derive. The above approach outlines the combinatorial reasoning, but finding a neat closed-form solution would likely require additional insights or constraints on the problem.</code></pre>
