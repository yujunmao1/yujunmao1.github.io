<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r â‰  1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Is it possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... such that the sum is 1/7, and if so, what is the sequence?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The given sequence is a geometric sequence with the first term \( a = 1 \) and a common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). We are looking for a subsequence that starts from some term in the given sequence and sums up to \( \frac{1}{7} \).

Let&#x27;s denote the first term of the subsequence as \( a_k \), which is some term in the original sequence. Since the original sequence starts with 1 and each subsequent term is half the previous one, the k-th term of the original sequence can be written as \( a_k = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \), where \( k \) is a positive integer.

The sum of an infinite geometric sequence starting with \( a_k \) and having a common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \) is given by the formula for the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

\[ S_{\infty} = \frac{a_k}{1 - r} \]

We want this sum to be \( \frac{1}{7} \), so we set up the equation:

\[ \frac{1}{7} = \frac{a_k}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]

Solving for \( a_k \):

\[ \frac{1}{7} = \frac{a_k}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ a_k = \frac{1}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ a_k = \frac{1}{14} \]

Now we need to find the value of \( k \) such that \( a_k = \frac{1}{14} \). We know that \( a_k = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \), so we set them equal to each other:

\[ \frac{1}{14} = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \]

Since \( \frac{1}{14} \) is the same as \( \frac{1}{2^1} \cdot \frac{1}{7} \), we can write:

\[ \frac{1}{2^1 \cdot 7} = \frac{1}{2^{k-1}} \]

This implies that:

\[ 2^1 \cdot 7 = 2^{k-1} \]

Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:

\[ 1 + \log_2(7) = k - 1 \]
\[ k = 2 + \log_2(7) \]

Since \( \log_2(7) \) is not an integer, \( k \) is not an integer either. This means that there is no such k-th term in the original sequence that would start a subsequence summing up to \( \frac{1}{7} \). Therefore, it is not possible to select an infinite geometric subsequence from the given sequence such that the sum is \( \frac{1}{7} \).</code></pre>
