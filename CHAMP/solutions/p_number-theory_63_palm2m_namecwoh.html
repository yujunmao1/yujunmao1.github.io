<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4. For example, 12 is divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 2, are divisible by 4. 11 is not divisible by 4 because the last two digits, 1, are not divisible by 4.

Here is a more detailed explanation:

To check if a number is divisible by 4, you can use the following rule:

* If the last two digits of the number are divisible by 4, then the number is divisible by 4.
* If the last two digits of the number are not divisible by 4, then the number is not divisible by 4.

For example, let&#x27;s say we want to check if 12 is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 12 are 2, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, 12 is divisible by 4.

Now, let&#x27;s say we want to check if 11 is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 11 are 1, which is not divisible by 4. Therefore, 11 is not divisible by 4.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 12 + 4 = 0, 12 - 4 = 8, and 12 * 4 = 8.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. It can also be used to solve problems in everyday life, such as finding the day of the week on a given date.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 12 + 4 = 16, and 12 - 4 = 8.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 12 * 4 = 48, which is less than 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are less than or equal to the modulus. For example, you can divide 12 by 4, but you cannot divide 12 by 5.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. The modulus is always a positive integer.
* The remainder is the number that is left over when you divide one number by another. For example, the remainder when you divide 12 by 4 is 0, and the remainder when you divide 12 by 5 is 2.
* The order of operations is the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. For example, 12 + 4 * 5 = 60, and not 12 + 20 = 32.
* The commutative property of addition and multiplication holds in modular arithmetic. For example, 12 + 4 = 4 + 12, and 12 * 4 = 4 * 12.
* The associative property of addition and multiplication holds in modular arithmetic. For example, (12 + 4) + 2 = 12 + (4 + 2), and (12 * 4) * 2 = 12 * (4 * 2).
* The distributive property of multiplication over addition holds in modular arithmetic. For example, 12 * (4 + 2) = 12 * 4 + 12 * 2, and (12 + 4) * 2 = 12 * 2 + 4 * 2.
* The identity element for addition is 0. For example, 0 + 12 = 12, and 12 + 0 = 12.
* The identity element for multiplication is 1. For example, 12 * 1 = 12, and 1 * 12 = 12.
* The inverse element for addition is the opposite number. For example, the inverse of 12 is -12, because 12 + (-12) = 0.
* The inverse element for multiplication is the reciprocal. For example, the inverse of 12 is 1/12, because 12 * (1/12) = 1.

Is 385^1980+18^1980 a perfect square?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Yes, $385^{1980}+18^{1980}$ is a perfect square.

We can prove this by using the following lemma:

&gt; **Lemma:** If $a$ and $b$ are integers, then $a^n+b^n$ is a perfect square if and only if $n$ is even.

_Proof._ If $n$ is even, then we can write $n=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, we have

$$a^n+b^n = (a^k)^2 + (b^k)^2 = (a^k+b^k)(a^k-b^k).$$

Since $a^k$ and $b^k$ are integers, $a^k+b^k$ and $a^k-b^k$ are also integers. Therefore, $a^n+b^n$ is a perfect square.

Conversely, if $a^n+b^n$ is a perfect square, then we can write $a^n+b^n = (x^2)$ for some integer $x$. Then, we have

$$a^n = x^2 - b^n.$$

Since $a^n$ and $b^n$ are integers, $x^2$ is also an integer. Therefore, $x$ must be an integer. Let $x=y^2$ for some integer $y$. Then, we have

$$a^n = (y^2)^2 - b^n = y^4 - b^n.$$

Since $a^n$ and $b^n$ are integers, $y^4$ is also an integer. Therefore, $y$ must be an integer. Let $y=z^2$ for some integer $z$. Then, we have

$$a^n = (z^2)^2 - b^n = z^4 - b^n.$$

Since $a^n$ and $b^n$ are integers, $z^4$ is also an integer. Therefore, $z$ must be an integer. This means that $n$ must be even.

Now, let&#x27;s apply the lemma to the problem at hand. We have $a=385$ and $b=18$. Therefore, $n=1980$ is even. Hence, $385^{1980}+18^{1980}$ is a perfect square.</code></pre>
