What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we are looking for the smallest positive value of the expression |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. This means we are looking for the smallest difference between a power of 12 and a power of 5.

Let&#x27;s start by examining some small values of m and n to see if we can find a pattern or a pair that gives us a small difference.

For m = 1 and n = 1:
|12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7

For m = 2 and n = 1:
|12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139

For m = 1 and n = 2:
|12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13

We can see that the values are not particularly close. We need to find powers of 12 and 5 that are closer to each other. Since 12^m grows much faster than 5^n, we should try to keep m relatively small and increase n.

Let&#x27;s try to get closer by increasing n:

For m = 1 and n = 3:
|12^1 - 5^3| = |12 - 125| = 113

This is still not very close. Let&#x27;s try increasing n further:

For m = 1 and n = 4:
|12^1 - 5^4| = |12 - 625| = 613

The difference is getting larger, so increasing n while keeping m at 1 is not helping. Let&#x27;s try increasing m:

For m = 2 and n = 3:
|12^2 - 5^3| = |144 - 125| = 19

This is closer than our previous attempts. Let&#x27;s try increasing m to 3:

For m = 3 and n = 3:
|12^3 - 5^3| = |1728 - 125| = 1603

The difference is much larger again. It seems that m = 2 and n = 3 is the closest we&#x27;ve gotten so far. Let&#x27;s try m = 2 and n = 4:

For m = 2 and n = 4:
|12^2 - 5^4| = |144 - 625| = 481

This is not as close as m = 2 and n = 3. Let&#x27;s try m = 2 and n = 2:

For m = 2 and n = 2:
|12^2 - 5^2| = |144 - 25| = 119

This is not as close as m = 2 and n = 3 either. It seems that we need to find a balance between the powers of 12 and 5.

Let&#x27;s try m = 3 and n = 5:
|12^3 - 5^5| = |1728 - 3125| = 1397

This is not as close as m = 2 and n = 3. It seems that we need to find a balance between the powers of 12 and 5.
