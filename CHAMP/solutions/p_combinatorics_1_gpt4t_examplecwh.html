<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let x_n, y_n, z_n be the number of length-n strings that end with digit 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. What are x_1, y_1, z_1?
3. By appending a digit to the existing string, derive the formula for x_(n+1), y_(n+1), z_(n+1) from x_n, y_n, z_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will first determine the base cases x_1, y_1, and z_1, which represent the number of length-1 strings ending with the digits 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Since the strings are of length 1, there is only one way to have a string ending in each of the digits:

x_1 = 1 (the string &quot;1&quot;)
y_1 = 1 (the string &quot;2&quot;)
z_1 = 1 (the string &quot;3&quot;)

Now, let&#x27;s derive the formulas for x_(n+1), y_(n+1), and z_(n+1) based on x_n, y_n, and z_n.

For a string of length n+1 to end with a 1, the previous string of length n could have ended with either a 1 or a 2 (since the adjacent digits must differ by less than or equal to 1). Therefore:

x_(n+1) = x_n + y_n

For a string of length n+1 to end with a 2, the previous string of length n could have ended with a 1, 2, or 3:

y_(n+1) = x_n + y_n + z_n

For a string of length n+1 to end with a 3, the previous string of length n could have ended with either a 2 or a 3:

z_(n+1) = y_n + z_n

Now we will use these recursive formulas to calculate x_6, y_6, and z_6.

Starting with n=1:
x_1 = 1
y_1 = 1
z_1 = 1

For n=2:
x_2 = x_1 + y_1 = 1 + 1 = 2
y_2 = x_1 + y_1 + z_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
z_2 = y_1 + z_1 = 1 + 1 = 2

For n=3:
x_3 = x_2 + y_2 = 2 + 3 = 5
y_3 = x_2 + y_2 + z_2 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
z_3 = y_2 + z_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

For n=4:
x_4 = x_3 + y_3 = 5 + 7 = 12
y_4 = x_3 + y_3 + z_3 = 5 + 7 + 5 = 17
z_4 = y_3 + z_3 = 7 + 5 = 12

For n=5:
x_5 = x_4 + y_4 = 12 + 17 = 29
y_5 = x_4 + y_4 + z_4 = 12 + 17 + 12 = 41
z_5 = y_4 + z_4 = 17 + 12 = 29

Finally, for n=6:
x_6 = x_5 + y_5 = 29 + 41 = 70
y_6 = x_5 + y_5 + z_5 = 29 + 41 + 29 = 99
z_6 = y_5 + z_5 = 41 + 29 = 70

The total number of strings of length 6 with adjacent digits differing by less than or equal to 1 is the sum of x_6, y_6, and z_6:

Total = x_6 + y_6 + z_6
Total = 70 + 99 + 70
Total = 239

Therefore, there are 239 such strings of length 6.</code></pre>
