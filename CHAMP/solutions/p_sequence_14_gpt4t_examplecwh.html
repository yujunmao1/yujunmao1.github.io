<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The formula you&#x27;ve provided is a recursive relationship for binomial coefficients, which are often denoted as C(n, k), read as &quot;n choose k,&quot; or alternatively written as \( \binom{n}{k} \). This formula expresses the fact that each binomial coefficient can be calculated based on the previous one in a recursive manner.

The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \) represents the number of ways to choose a subset of k elements from a larger set of n distinct elements without regard to the order of selection.

The recursive formula you&#x27;ve provided seems to have a slight mistake. The correct relationship is:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n}{k} \cdot \binom{n-1}{k-1} \]

This formula can be derived from the definition of the binomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

Now, let&#x27;s apply the correct formula to an example. Suppose we want to calculate \( \binom{5}{3} \) using the recursive relationship.

First, we start with a known base case, such as \( \binom{4}{2} \), which can be calculated directly:

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6 \]

Now, we can use the recursive formula to find \( \binom{5}{3} \):

\[ \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 6 \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 5 \cdot 2 \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 ways to choose a subset of 3 elements from a set of 5 distinct elements.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, k)=C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which states that choosing \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements is equivalent to choosing the \( n - k \) elements that you&#x27;re not choosing. In other words, when you choose \( k \) elements, you&#x27;re simultaneously choosing the \( n - k \) elements to be left out. This property is expressed mathematically as:

\[ C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \]

or, using binomial coefficient notation,

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k} \]

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example. Suppose we have a set of 5 elements, and we want to choose 2 of them. According to the symmetry property, this should be equivalent to choosing 3 elements to leave out (since 5 - 2 = 3). Let&#x27;s calculate both sides of the equation to verify this.

First, we calculate \( C(5, 2) \):

\[ C(5, 2) = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \]

Now, we calculate \( C(5, 3) \):

\[ C(5, 3) = \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{3 \times 2} = 10 \]

As expected, \( C(5, 2) \) and \( C(5, 3) \) are equal, both giving us 10. This demonstrates that there are 10 ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 5, which is the same as the number of ways to choose 3 elements to leave out from the same set.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded above to illustrate this concept. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

\[ a_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k} \]

So the first few terms of the sequence are:

\[ a_1 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ a_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \]
\[ a_4 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16} \]
\[ \vdots \]

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is greater than the one before it. To see this, notice that for each \( n \), \( a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \), and since \( \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} &gt; 0 \), it follows that \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \).

The sequence is also bounded above by 1. This is because the sum is a geometric series where each term is half the previous term, and the sum of an infinite geometric series with a ratio less than 1 is finite. Specifically, the sum of this series is:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k} = 1 \]

This can be seen by considering the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. In this case, \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), so:

\[ S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 \]

Therefore, the sequence \( (a_n) \) is bounded above by 1.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence \( (a_n) \) is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 1. Thus, we can say:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 1 \]</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let the sequence be defined as a_n=1/C(n, 0)+1/C(n, 1)+...+1/C(n, n). Does the limit of the sequence exist, and if so, what is it?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the relationship between a_n and a_(n-1).
2. For even n, express a_n in terms of a_(n-1) by isolating the first term and grouping each pair of the terms from the two ends.
3. For odd n, express a_n in terms of a_(n-1) by isolating the first term, grouping each pair of the terms from the two ends and adding the remaining middle term.
4. Write out the first few terms of a_n up to a_5 and study the relationship between a_n and 2+2/n.
5. Study the monotonicity of the sequence after a_4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s analyze the sequence \( a_n \) defined as:

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{C(n, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(n, 1)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{C(n, n)} \]

First, we note that \( C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), and by the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, \( C(n, k) = C(n, n-k) \).

Now, let&#x27;s look at the relationship between \( a_n \) and \( a_{n-1} \). For even \( n \), we can express \( a_n \) in terms of \( a_{n-1} \) by isolating the first term and grouping each pair of terms from the two ends. For odd \( n \), we do the same but also add the remaining middle term.

Let&#x27;s write out the first few terms of \( a_n \) up to \( a_5 \):

\[ a_1 = \frac{1}{C(1, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(1, 1)} = 2 \]
\[ a_2 = \frac{1}{C(2, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(2, 1)} + \frac{1}{C(2, 2)} = 2 + \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{C(3, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(3, 1)} + \frac{1}{C(3, 2)} + \frac{1}{C(3, 3)} = 2 + \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ a_4 = \frac{1}{C(4, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(4, 1)} + \frac{1}{C(4, 2)} + \frac{1}{C(4, 3)} + \frac{1}{C(4, 4)} = 2 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{1}{C(5, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(5, 1)} + \frac{1}{C(5, 2)} + \frac{1}{C(5, 3)} + \frac{1}{C(5, 4)} + \frac{1}{C(5, 5)} = 2 + \frac{2}{5} \]

We can see a pattern emerging where \( a_n \) seems to be approaching \( 2 \) as \( n \) increases. To prove this, we need to show that the sequence is monotonic and bounded.

For \( n \geq 4 \), we can see that each term \( \frac{1}{C(n, k)} \) for \( k \neq 0, n \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{1}{C(n-1, k-1)} \) because \( C(n, k) \geq C(n-1, k-1) \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1 \). This is because \( C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) \), and \( C(n-1, k) \) is positive.

Therefore, \( a_n \) is monotonically decreasing for \( n \geq 4 \) because each term in the sum for \( a_n \) is less than or equal to the corresponding term in \( a_{n-1} \), and there are fewer terms in \( a_{n-1} \) than in \( a_n \).

The sequence is also bounded below by 2 because \( a_n \) is always greater than 2 for all \( n \). This is clear from the fact that \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( a_n \) includes the terms \( \frac{1}{C(n, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(n, n)} = 2 \) for all \( n \), plus additional positive terms.

Since the sequence \( (a_n) \) is monotonically decreasing and bounded below by 2, it must have a limit according to the Monotone Convergence Theorem. The limit is at least 2, but to find the exact limit, we need to analyze the additional terms beyond the first and last terms in the sequence.

As \( n \) becomes large, the terms \( \frac{1}{C(n, k)} \) for \( k \neq 0, n \) become very small because the binomial coefficients \( C(n, k) \) grow quickly with \( n \). Therefore, the sum of these additional terms becomes negligible, and the limit of the sequence \( a_n \) approaches 2.

In conclusion, the limit of the sequence \( a_n \) exists and is equal to 2:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 2 \]</code></pre>
