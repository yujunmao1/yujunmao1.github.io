<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?
Step-wise solution:
1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.
2. We can paint it on top, the remaining four faces have 4! colorings, but we can rotate the cube four times, which makes four colorings the same, so we 4!/4=6 distinct colorings.
3. If the second face is on the side, we can put it on the front, and the two faces uniquely fix the rotation.
4. Thus, any coloring of the remaining four faces is distinct, and we have 4!=24 colorings.
5. In total, we have 30 colorings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can consider the possible moves for each child. Each child has three options: stay in the current seat, move one seat to the left, or move one seat to the right. However, the children on the ends have only two options since they can&#x27;t move outside the row. We also need to consider that no two children can occupy the same seat after moving.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of seats as \( n \) (in this case, \( n = 11 \)) and try to find a pattern or a method to calculate the number of possible rearrangements.

1. If we have only 1 seat, there is only 1 arrangement (the child stays in the seat).
2. If we have 2 seats, there are 2 arrangements:
   - Both children stay in their seats.
   - They swap seats.

For more than 2 seats, we need to consider the constraints. Let&#x27;s analyze the situation with 3 seats to find a pattern:

1. All children stay in their original seats.
2. The middle child moves to the left or right, and the corresponding end child moves into the middle seat.
3. The end children swap seats, and the middle child stays put.

For 3 seats, we have 5 possible arrangements. Now, let&#x27;s try to generalize this for \( n \) seats.

We can think of each child&#x27;s move as a binary decision (move or not move), but we must ensure that no two children end up in the same seat. This problem is similar to the classic problem of counting the number of ways to tile a 1 x n board with 1 x 1 and 1 x 2 tiles. Each child staying in their seat corresponds to a 1 x 1 tile, and each pair of children swapping seats corresponds to a 1 x 2 tile.

Let&#x27;s denote \( T(n) \) as the number of ways to tile a 1 x n board with 1 x 1 and 1 x 2 tiles. The recurrence relation for this is:

\( T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) \)

This is because to tile a 1 x n board, we can either place a 1 x 1 tile and then tile the remaining 1 x (n-1) board, or place a 1 x 2 tile and then tile the remaining 1 x (n-2) board.

The base cases are:
\( T(1) = 1 \) (only one way to place a 1 x 1 tile)
\( T(2) = 2 \) (either two 1 x 1 tiles or one 1 x 2 tile)

Now we can calculate \( T(n) \) for \( n = 11 \) using this recurrence relation:

\( T(3) = T(2) + T(1) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
\( T(4) = T(3) + T(2) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
\( T(5) = T(4) + T(3) = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
\( T(6) = T(5) + T(4) = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
\( T(7) = T(6) + T(5) = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
\( T(8) = T(7) + T(6) = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
\( T(9) = T(8) + T(7) = 34 + 21 = 55 \)
\( T(10) = T(9) + T(8) = 55 + 34 = 89 \)
\( T(11) = T(10) + T(9) = 89 + 55 = 144 \)

Therefore, there are 144 possible rearrangements of the children, including the original one.</code></pre>
