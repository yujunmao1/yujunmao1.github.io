<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The cube of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that express the cube of a sum or difference of two numbers in terms of the individual numbers and their powers. These formulas are useful for expanding expressions that involve cubed binomials.

The cube of sum formula is given by:

(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

This formula states that the cube of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the cube of the second number.

Similarly, the cube of difference formula is given by:

(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

This formula states that the cube of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the difference of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the negative of the cube of the second number.

Both formulas can be derived from the binomial theorem or by directly multiplying out the binomial (a + b) or (a - b) three times. They are particularly useful in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics where simplifying expressions involving cubes is necessary.</code></pre>

Find all non-negative integer solutions to the equation x^3+8x^2-6x+8=y^3.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For positive a, the polynomial ax^2+bx+c≥0 for all x if and only if b^2-4ac≤0. One inequality is strict if and only if the other is also strict.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all non-negative integer solutions to the equation x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = y^3, we can start by trying to factor the left-hand side or by looking for patterns that might suggest a way to rewrite the equation.

First, let&#x27;s see if we can factor the left-hand side. We notice that the constant term and the coefficient of x^2 are both perfect cubes (8 = 2^3 and 8x^2 = (2x)^3). This suggests that we might be able to factor by grouping or by using the sum of cubes formula. However, the term -6x does not fit nicely into a sum of cubes pattern.

Let&#x27;s try to rewrite the equation in a way that might help us factor it. We can add and subtract 12x to complete the cube:

x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x^3 + 8x^2 + 16x) - (16x + 6x) + 8

Now we have:

x^3 + 8x^2 + 16x = (x + 2)^3

So the equation becomes:

(x + 2)^3 - 22x + 8 = y^3

Now we have a difference of cubes on the left-hand side:

(x + 2)^3 - (22x - 8) = y^3

However, this doesn&#x27;t seem to lead to an obvious factorization or solution. Let&#x27;s try another approach using the information provided about the polynomial ax^2 + bx + c.

We can rewrite the original equation as:

x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 - y^3 = 0

Let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 - y^3. We want to find the values of x and y such that f(x) = 0.

Notice that if x and y are non-negative integers and x^3 = y^3, then x = y. So, we can look for solutions where x^3 is close to y^3.

Let&#x27;s analyze the polynomial g(x) = x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 for non-negative x. We want to know if this polynomial can be a perfect cube for non-negative integer values of x.

The derivative of g(x) with respect to x is:

g&#x27;(x) = 3x^2 + 16x - 6

We can use the information provided about the polynomial ax^2 + bx + c to determine if g&#x27;(x) is always non-negative for non-negative x. If g&#x27;(x) is always non-negative, then g(x) is increasing, and we can more easily find where it might be equal to a perfect cube.

The discriminant of g&#x27;(x) is:

b^2 - 4ac = (16)^2 - 4(3)(-6) = 256 + 72 = 328

Since the discriminant is positive, g&#x27;(x) has two real roots, which means there are values of x for which g&#x27;(x) is negative. However, we are only interested in non-negative values of x.

Let&#x27;s find the roots of g&#x27;(x) to determine the behavior of g(x):

3x^2 + 16x - 6 = 0

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-16 ± √(16^2 - 4(3)(-6))]/(2*3)
x = [-16 ± √(328)]/6

Both roots will be real, but we need to check if they are positive or negative. Since 328 is positive and less than 16^2, the square root of 328 is less than 16. This means that one root is negative and one is positive because the negative sign in front of the square root will give a negative result, and the positive sign will give a positive result.

We are only interested in the positive root, which will tell us where g&#x27;(x) changes from negative to positive (indicating a minimum point for g(x)). Since g(x) is a cubic polynomial, it will go to negative infinity as x goes to negative infinity and to positive infinity as x goes to positive infinity. Therefore, g(x) has only one minimum for positive x.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the behavior of g(x) as x approaches this minimum. If g(x) is increasing for all x greater than this minimum, then there can only be one non-negative integer solution to g(x) = y^3, because once g(x) surpasses a perfect cube, it will never equal another perfect cube since it is strictly increasing.

To find the exact value of x where g(x) = y^3, we can look for integer solutions by trying small non-negative integer values for x and checking if g(x) is a perfect cube. Let&#x27;s start with x = 0:

g(0) = 0^3 + 8(0)^2 - 6(0) + 8 = 8

8 is not a perfect cube for a non-negative integer y. Now let&#x27;s try x = 1:

g(1) = 1^3 + 8(1)^2 - 6(1) + 8 = 1 + 8 - 6 + 8 = 11

11 is not a perfect cube. We can continue this process, but to save time, we can look for values of x where g(x) is close to a perfect cube. Since we are looking for non-negative integer solutions, we can check the values of g(x) for small integers and see if they correspond to the cube of an integer.

Let&#x27;s try x = 2:

g(2) = 2^3 + 8(2)^2 - 6(2) + 8 = 8 + 32 - 12 + 8 = 36

36 is not a perfect cube. Now let&#x27;s try x = 3:

g(3) = 3^3 + 8(3)^2 - 6(3) + 8 = 27 + 72 - 18 + 8 = 89

89 is not a perfect cube. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a more systematic way to find when g(x) is a perfect cube.

Since we are looking for non-negative integer solutions, we can use the fact that for large x, the term x^3 will dominate the behavior of g(x). This means that g(x) will be close to a perfect cube when x is close to a perfect cube.

Let&#x27;s denote k^3 as the perfect cube closest to g(x) for some integer k. Then we can write:

x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 ≈ k^3

Since we are looking for non-negative integer solutions, we can try values of k and see if we can find a corresponding x that satisfies the equation. Let&#x27;s start with k = 0:

0^3 = 0

This corresponds to x = 0, which we have already checked. Now let&#x27;s try k = 1:

1^3 = 1

This does not correspond to a non-negative integer x that satisfies the equation. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a more systematic way to find when g(x) is a perfect cube.

One approach is to consider the behavior of g(x) - k^3 as a function of x for different values of k. If we can find a value of k such that g(x) - k^3 changes sign as x increases, then by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a value of x where g(x) - k^3 = 0, which means g(x) = k^3.

Let&#x27;s try this approach for small values of k. We have already checked k = 0 and k = 1. Let&#x27;s try k = 2:

g(x) - 2^3 = x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 - 8 = x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x

We want to find an x such that g(x) - 2^3 = 0. Let&#x27;s try x = 2:

g(2) - 2^3 = 2^3 + 8(2)^2 - 6(2) - 8 = 8 + 32 - 12 - 8 = 20

20 is not zero, so x = 2 is not a solution. Let&#x27;s try x = 3:

g(3) - 2^3 = 3^3 + 8(3)^2 - 6(3) - 8 = 27 + 72 - 18 - 8 = 73

73 is not zero, so x = 3 is not a solution. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a more systematic way to find when g(x) - k^3 = 0.
