<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical expression that allows us to factorize a quadratic expression that is in the form of a difference between two perfect squares. It states that:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

In this formula, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; represent any real numbers or variables. The left side of the equation represents the difference between the squares of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, while the right side represents the factored form of the expression.

To understand why this formula works, let&#x27;s expand the right side of the equation:

(a + b)(a - b) = a(a) + a(-b) + b(a) + b(-b)
               = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

As you can see, the expanded form of the right side matches the left side of the equation, which confirms that the formula is correct.

The difference of squares formula is particularly useful when we encounter quadratic expressions that can be written as the difference between two perfect squares. By factoring the expression using this formula, we can simplify it and potentially solve equations or simplify further calculations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and their remainders when divided by a fixed positive integer called the modulus. The concept of modular arithmetic is based on the idea that numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they exceed the modulus.

Modular arithmetic rules are a set of properties and operations that apply specifically to modular arithmetic. Here are some important rules:

1. Addition: If a and b are two numbers, then (a + b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n. In other words, to find the sum of two numbers modulo n, you can first find the remainder of each number when divided by n, add them together, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

2. Subtraction: If a and b are two numbers, then (a - b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) - (b mod n)) mod n. Similar to addition, you can find the difference of two numbers modulo n by first finding the remainders of each number when divided by n, subtracting them, and then taking the remainder of the result when divided by n.

3. Multiplication: If a and b are two numbers, then (a * b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) * (b mod n)) mod n. To find the product of two numbers modulo n, you can find the remainders of each number when divided by n, multiply them together, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

4. Exponentiation: If a is a number and k is a positive integer, then a^k mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n)^k) mod n. To find the result of raising a number to a power modulo n, you can first find the remainder of the base when divided by n, raise it to the power of k, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

These rules are particularly useful in various areas of mathematics, computer science, and cryptography, where modular arithmetic is commonly applied. They allow us to perform calculations efficiently and work with remainders in a systematic way.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.
4. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
5. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
6. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
7. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
8. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
9. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |12^m-5^n|, we can start by considering the properties mentioned in the additional information:

1. If the expression 12^m-5^n is equal to 0, it means that 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are not divisible by each other, there are no positive integer solutions for m and n in this case.

2. Since 5 and 12 are co-prime (they have no common factors other than 1), the expression 12^m-5^n cannot be equal to 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The property gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1 implies that 12^m and 5^n are relatively prime. Therefore, 12^m-5^n cannot be divisible by any power of 5.

4. To check if 12^m-5^n can be equal to 1, we can express 5^n in terms of m. We have 5^n = (12-1)^n = 12^n - n*12^(n-1) + ... - n*12 + 1. Since 12^m-5^n = 1, we can substitute 5^n with the expression we derived: 12^m - (12^n - n*12^(n-1) + ... - n*12 + 1) = 1. Simplifying, we get 12^m + n*12^(n-1) + ... + n*12 - 12^n = 2. This equation shows that there are no positive integer solutions for m and n.

5. Considering the equation modulo 3, we have 12^m ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 5^n ≡ 2 (mod 3). Since 12^m ≡ 1 (mod 3), m must be even. Therefore, n must be odd for 5^n ≡ 2 (mod 3).

6. For even n, we can factor 5^n-1 as (5-1)(5^(n-1) + 5^(n-2) + ... + 5 + 1). Since 5^n-1 is divisible by 4, both factors must be divisible by 4. However, 5-1 = 4 is not divisible by 4, so there are no positive integer solutions for even n.

7. We can express 12^m as 2^(2m)*3^m. Setting up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1, we have 2^(2m)*3^m = 5^n-1. This equation shows that both factors must be divisible by 3.

8. To check if both factors can be divisible by 3, we can subtract them: 5^n-1 - 2^(2m)*3^m = 4. Since 4 is not divisible by 3, there are no positive integer solutions.

9. Considering all the properties and information above, we can conclude that there are no positive integer solutions for m and n that make 12^m-5^n equal to any value.

Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n is undefined, as there are no solutions.</code></pre>
