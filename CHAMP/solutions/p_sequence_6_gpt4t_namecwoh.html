<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: square of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that describe the expansion of the square of a sum or difference of two terms. These formulas are very useful in simplifying algebraic expressions and solving equations. Here are the formulas:

1. Square of a sum formula:
The square of a sum formula states that the square of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers plus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

This formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a + b) by itself:

(a + b)(a + b) = a² + ab + ba + b²
               = a² + ab + ab + b²
               = a² + 2ab + b²

2. Square of a difference formula:
The square of a difference formula states that the square of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers minus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

Similarly, this formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a - b) by itself:

(a - b)(a - b) = a² - ab - ba + b²
               = a² - ab - ab + b²
               = a² - 2ab + b²

These formulas are part of the larger family of binomial expansion formulas and are particularly helpful in simplifying expressions without having to perform the full binomial multiplication. They are also used in various mathematical applications, including geometry, calculus, and number theory.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a fundamental result in linear algebra and mathematical analysis, with important implications in various fields such as physics, economics, and statistics. It provides an upper bound on the absolute value of the inner product of two vectors in terms of the product of their norms.

Let&#x27;s consider two vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) in an inner product space (which could be a Euclidean space, a function space, or any other space where an inner product is defined). The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:

\[ | \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle | \leq \| \mathbf{u} \| \cdot \| \mathbf{v} \| \]

where:
- \( \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle \) denotes the inner product of vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \).
- \( \| \mathbf{u} \| \) and \( \| \mathbf{v} \| \) denote the norms of vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), respectively.

In the context of Euclidean space \( \mathbb{R}^n \), the inner product of two vectors \( \mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n) \) and \( \mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n) \) is defined as:

\[ \langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v} \rangle = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n \]

And the norm of a vector \( \mathbf{u} \) is defined as the square root of the inner product of \( \mathbf{u} \) with itself:

\[ \| \mathbf{u} \| = \sqrt{\langle \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{u} \rangle} = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2} \]

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in \( \mathbb{R}^n \) can then be written as:

\[ | u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \ldots + u_nv_n | \leq \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \ldots + u_n^2} \cdot \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \ldots + v_n^2} \]

The equality holds if and only if the vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \) are linearly dependent, which means one is a scalar multiple of the other.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a powerful tool because it allows us to compare the inner product of two vectors with the product of their magnitudes, providing a geometric interpretation of the angle between the vectors and establishing a relationship between the dot product and the concept of orthogonality. It also plays a crucial role in proving other mathematical results, such as the triangle inequality in normed spaces and the Bessel inequality in the context of Hilbert spaces.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. At most how many of the three sequences can be bounded?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For positive x, x+1/x≥2, with equality if and only if x=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given inequality for positive \( x \), which is \( x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2 \), with equality if and only if \( x = 1 \). This inequality is a consequence of the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean.

Let&#x27;s analyze the sequences \( \{x_n\} \), \( \{y_n\} \), and \( \{z_n\} \) given by the recursive formulas:

\( x_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{z_n} \)
\( y_{n+1} = z_n + \frac{1}{x_n} \)
\( z_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{1}{y_n} \)

Since \( x_1, y_1, z_1 \) are positive, all terms in the sequences will be positive because the recursive formulas only involve addition and division by positive terms.

Now, let&#x27;s apply the inequality \( x + \frac{1}{x} \geq 2 \) to each of the recursive formulas:

For \( x_{n+1} \):
\( x_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{z_n} \geq 2 \) because \( y_n \) and \( z_n \) are positive.

For \( y_{n+1} \):
\( y_{n+1} = z_n + \frac{1}{x_n} \geq 2 \) because \( z_n \) and \( x_n \) are positive.

For \( z_{n+1} \):
\( z_{n+1} = x_n + \frac{1}{y_n} \geq 2 \) because \( x_n \) and \( y_n \) are positive.

This means that each term in the sequences is at least 2, and since the sequences are defined recursively, each subsequent term depends on the previous terms, which are all greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the sequences are monotonically increasing because each term is greater than or equal to the previous term.

Since the sequences are monotonically increasing and bounded below by 2, they cannot be bounded above (because there is no maximum value they can approach without eventually exceeding it). Therefore, none of the sequences \( \{x_n\} \), \( \{y_n\} \), or \( \{z_n\} \) can be bounded.

The final answer is that at most zero of the three sequences can be bounded.</code></pre>
