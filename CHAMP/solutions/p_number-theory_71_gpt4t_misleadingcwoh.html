What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. For integer a, b and odd n, a + b | a^n + b^n.
2. a^n-1=(a-1)(a^(n-1)+a^(n-2)+...+a+1).
3. If a | c, b | c and gcd(a, b)=1, then ab | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n, we need to consider the properties given and try to find a pair of (m, n) that minimizes this expression.

First, let&#x27;s consider the properties:

1. For integer a, b and odd n, a + b | a^n + b^n.
This property tells us that if n is odd, then a + b will divide a^n + b^n.

2. a^n - 1 = (a - 1)(a^(n-1) + a^(n-2) + ... + a + 1).
This property is a factorization of a^n - 1.

3. If a | c, b | c and gcd(a, b) = 1, then ab | c.
This property tells us that if a divides c, b divides c, and a and b are coprime, then the product ab will also divide c.

Now, let&#x27;s try to apply these properties to our problem. We want to minimize |12^m - 5^n|. One way to approach this is to look for cases where 12^m and 5^n are close to each other, which would happen when one is a small increment or decrement away from the other.

Let&#x27;s consider the case where m = 1 and n is odd. According to property 1, since n is odd, 12 + 5 will divide 12^n + 5^n. However, we are looking for 12^m - 5^n, not the sum. So, this property doesn&#x27;t directly help us minimize the expression.

Next, let&#x27;s consider property 2. If we can find m and n such that 12^m is just 1 more than a power of 5, or 5^n is just 1 more than a power of 12, we could apply this property. However, since 12 and 5 are not one apart and their powers grow quickly, it&#x27;s unlikely we&#x27;ll find small m and n that satisfy this condition.

Finally, let&#x27;s consider property 3. We want to find a case where 12^m - 5^n is divisible by both 12 and 5, which would imply it&#x27;s divisible by 60 since gcd(12, 5) = 1. However, since 12^m will always be divisible by 12 and 5^n will never be divisible by 12 (for n &gt; 0), this property doesn&#x27;t seem to help us directly either.

Given the difficulty in applying these properties directly, we might need to take a more brute force approach, trying out small values of m and n to find when |12^m - 5^n| is minimized.

Let&#x27;s start with small values of m and n and calculate |12^m - 5^n|:

For m = 1, n = 1: |12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7
For m = 1, n = 2: |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13
For m = 2, n = 1: |12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139
...

We can see that the difference grows quickly as we increase m or n. We&#x27;re looking for the smallest value, so we want to keep m and n small. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a more systematic approach to find the smallest value.

One observation we can make is that since 12^m and 5^n are both increasing functions of m and n, respectively, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| will occur when m and n are as small as possible. We can also note that 12^m will always be even, and 5^n will always be odd, so |12^m - 5^n| will never be zero (since an even number minus an odd number is odd).

Given these observations, we can try to find the smallest value by looking for the smallest m and n such that 12^m is just slightly larger than 5^n or vice versa. We can do this by trial and error:

For m = 1, n = 1: |12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7
For m = 1, n = 2: |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13
For m = 2, n = 1: |12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139
For m = 2, n = 2: |12^2 - 5^2| = |144 - 25| = 119
For m = 2, n = 3: |12^2 - 5^3| = |144 - 125| = 19
For m = 3, n = 2: |12^3 - 5^2| = |1728 - 25| = 1703
...

We can see that the smallest value we&#x27;ve found so far is when m = 2 and n = 3, which gives us |12^2 - 5^3| = |144 - 125| = 19. This is the smallest value we&#x27;ve found through this trial and error process.

Without a more systematic approach or additional properties to apply, we can tentatively say that the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n that we&#x27;ve found through this process is 19, when m = 2 and n = 3. However, to be certain that this is indeed the smallest value, we would need to check all pairs of (m, n) that could potentially give a smaller result, which could be a very large number of cases to consider.</code></pre>
