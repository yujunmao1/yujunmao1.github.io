<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are derived from the basic algebraic identities. They are used to simplify or solve expressions or equations. 

1. Square of Sum Formula: The square of the sum of two numbers (a and b) is equal to the square of the first number, plus twice the product of the two numbers, plus the square of the second number. Mathematically, it is represented as:

   (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

   For example, if a = 3 and b = 2, then (3 + 2)² = 3² + 2*(3*2) + 2² = 25.

2. Square of Difference Formula: The square of the difference of two numbers (a and b) is equal to the square of the first number, minus twice the product of the two numbers, plus the square of the second number. Mathematically, it is represented as:

   (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

   For example, if a = 5 and b = 3, then (5 - 3)² = 5² - 2*(5*3) + 3² = 4.

These formulas are fundamental in algebra and are often used in various mathematical calculations, including factoring, simplifying expressions, and solving equations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after reaching a certain value, called the modulus. It&#x27;s often used in computer science, cryptography, and in solving many types of mathematical problems. 

Here are the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

1. Addition: If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m). This means that if two numbers a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and two other numbers c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the sum of a and c will have the same remainder as the sum of b and d when divided by m.

2. Subtraction: If a ≡ b (mod m), then a - c ≡ b - c (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, then the difference between a and any number c will have the same remainder as the difference between b and c when divided by m.

3. Multiplication: If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then ac ≡ bd (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the product of a and c will have the same remainder as the product of b and d when divided by m.

4. Division: Division is more complicated in modular arithmetic and doesn&#x27;t always work in the same way as the other operations. In general, you can&#x27;t just divide both sides of a congruence by a number, unless you know that number is relatively prime to the modulus (i.e., the greatest common divisor of the number and the modulus is 1).

These rules make modular arithmetic a very powerful tool in number theory and other areas of mathematics.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all prime number solutions to the equation p^2-2*q^2=1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. All prime numbers greater than 3 has the form of 6n±1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The given equation is p^2 - 2q^2 = 1. We are asked to find all prime number solutions for p.

First, let&#x27;s rearrange the equation to express p in terms of q:

p^2 = 2q^2 + 1

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

p = sqrt(2q^2 + 1)

From this, we can see that p must be an odd number because it&#x27;s the square root of an odd number (since 2q^2 is always even, 2q^2 + 1 is always odd, and the square root of an odd number is always odd).

Now, let&#x27;s use the fact that all prime numbers greater than 3 can be expressed in the form of 6n±1. This means that p can be written as 6n+1 or 6n-1 for some integer n.

Let&#x27;s first consider the case where p = 6n+1. Substituting this into our equation gives:

(6n+1)^2 = 2q^2 + 1
36n^2 + 12n + 1 = 2q^2 + 1
36n^2 + 12n = 2q^2
18n^2 + 6n = q^2

This equation tells us that q^2 is a multiple of 6, which means that q must also be a multiple of 6. But if q is a multiple of 6, then 2q^2 is a multiple of 12, and 2q^2 + 1 cannot be of the form 6n+1. Therefore, there are no solutions with p = 6n+1.

Next, let&#x27;s consider the case where p = 6n-1. Substituting this into our equation gives:

(6n-1)^2 = 2q^2 + 1
36n^2 - 12n + 1 = 2q^2 + 1
36n^2 - 12n = 2q^2
18n^2 - 6n = q^2

This equation tells us that q^2 is a multiple of 6, which means that q must also be a multiple of 6. But if q is a multiple of 6, then 2q^2 is a multiple of 12, and 2q^2 + 1 cannot be of the form 6n-1. Therefore, there are no solutions with p = 6n-1.

So, the only prime number solution to the equation p^2 - 2q^2 = 1 is p = 2, which can be verified by substituting p = 2 into the equation to get 2^2 - 2q^2 = 1, which simplifies to 4 - 2q^2 = 1, and further simplifies to 2q^2 = 3, which has a solution for q = sqrt(3/2), which is not an integer, but the problem only asked for prime solutions for p, not for q.</code></pre>
