<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is one way to solve the problem:

We can think of each child as being in one of 11 possible positions. The first child has 11 choices, the second child has 10 choices, and so on. So, there are $11\times10\times9\times8\times7\times6\times5\times4\times3\times2\times1 = 11!$ possible rearrangements.

However, we are counting each rearrangement multiple times. For example, the rearrangements 12345678910 and 10987654321 are the same, but we counted them as two different rearrangements. So, we need to divide the number of possible rearrangements by the number of ways to rearrange the children without changing the order.

There are 11! ways to rearrange 11 objects, but we need to divide by 2! because there are two ways to rearrange the children without changing the order. So, the number of possible rearrangements is $\frac{11!}{2!} = 55,248,800$.

Another way to solve the problem is to use the concept of permutations. A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order. The number of permutations of n objects is given by the formula $n!$.

In this problem, we have 11 objects (the children) and each object can be in any of 11 positions. So, the number of permutations is $11!$. However, we are counting each rearrangement multiple times. For example, the rearrangements 12345678910 and 10987654321 are the same, but we counted them as two different rearrangements. So, we need to divide the number of permutations by the number of ways to rearrange the children without changing the order.

There are 11! ways to rearrange 11 objects, but we need to divide by 2! because there are two ways to rearrange the children without changing the order. So, the number of possible rearrangements is $\frac{11!}{2!} = 55,248,800$.</code></pre>
