<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider an example where you have free time during the weekend and you want to choose an activity to do on Saturday. You have several options, but you can only do one activity due to time constraints.

Action 1: Watch a movie.
- You have 3 movies you&#x27;re interested in watching.

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.

Action 2: Read a book.
- You have 2 new books to choose from.

There are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.

Action 3: Go for a hike.
- There are 4 different trails nearby.

There are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

Action 4: Visit a friend.
- You have 5 friends you could potentially visit.

There are p_4 = 5 ways to perform the fourth action.

Since you can only choose one activity to do on Saturday, the total number of ways you can spend your time is the sum of the ways to perform each individual action:

Total number of ways to spend Saturday = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4
                                        = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5
                                        = 14

So, there are 14 different ways you could choose to spend your Saturday, given these activity options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which the horses can finish the race, including the possibility of ties. We&#x27;ll break it down into cases based on the number of ties and then sum the number of ways for each case.

Case 1: No ties (all horses finish in a unique order)
There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to order 4 horses without ties.
4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways

Case 2: One tie and two unique places
This case involves a tie for one place and the other two horses finishing in the remaining two places. The tie can occur in the first, second, or third place, and for each tie position, we have to arrange the remaining horses.

- Tie for 1st place: There are C(4,2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie for 1st place, and then 2! ways to arrange the remaining 2 horses for 2nd and 3rd place.
- Tie for 2nd place: There are C(4,2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie for 2nd place, and then 2 ways to choose the horse for 1st place (the remaining horse is 3rd).
- Tie for 3rd place: There are C(4,2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie for 3rd place, and then 2! ways to arrange the remaining 2 horses for 1st and 2nd place.

For each tie position, we have:
C(4,2) × 2! = 6 × 2 = 12 ways

Since the tie can occur in any of the three positions, we multiply by 3:
3 × 12 = 36 ways

Case 3: Two ties
This case involves two separate ties. The ties can be for (1st and 2nd) places or (2nd and 3rd) places.

- Tie for 1st and 2nd places: There are C(4,2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie for 1st place, and then C(2,2) = 1 way to choose the remaining 2 horses that tie for 2nd place.
- Tie for 2nd and 3rd places: There are C(4,2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie for 2nd place, and then 2 ways to choose the horse for 1st place (the remaining horse is 4th).

For each tie combination, we have:
C(4,2) = 6 ways

Since there are two different tie combinations, we multiply by 2:
2 × 6 = 12 ways

Case 4: Three-way tie and one unique place
This case involves a three-way tie for one place and one horse finishing in a unique place. The tie can be for 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place.

- Three-way tie for 1st place: There are C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 horses that tie for 1st place, and then 1 way to choose the remaining horse for 2nd place.
- Three-way tie for 2nd place: There are C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 horses that tie for 2nd place, and then 1 way to choose the remaining horse for 1st place.
- Three-way tie for 3rd place: There are C(4,3) ways to choose the 3 horses that tie for 3rd place, and then 1 way to choose the remaining horse for 1st place.

For each tie position, we have:
C(4,3) = 4 ways

Since the tie can occur in any of the three positions, we multiply by 3:
3 × 4 = 12 ways

Case 5: Four-way tie
All horses tie for 1st place. There is only 1 way this can happen.

Now, we sum the number of ways for each case to get the total number of ways the 4 horses can finish the race (with the possibility of ties):

Total number of ways = Case 1 + Case 2 + Case 3 + Case 4 + Case 5
                     = 24 + 36 + 12 + 12 + 1
                     = 85 ways

Therefore, there are 85 different ways for 4 horses to go through the finish line, considering all possible tie scenarios.</code></pre>
