<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence is defined by a_1=sqrt(2), a_(n+1)=sqrt(2)^a_n. Does the limit for the sequence exist, and if so, find it.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study the monotonicity and boundedness of the sequence.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the limit of the sequence exists, we need to check if the sequence is monotonic and bounded. If it is both, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the sequence will converge.

Let&#x27;s start by examining the first few terms of the sequence to get a sense of its behavior:

a_1 = sqrt(2)
a_2 = sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2))
a_3 = sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2)))
...

It&#x27;s not immediately clear whether the sequence is monotonic or bounded just by looking at the first few terms, so we&#x27;ll need to analyze it further.

Let&#x27;s assume that the sequence is bounded above by some number M and increasing (monotonic). If the sequence is increasing, then for all n, we have a_n ≤ a_(n+1). If it&#x27;s bounded above by M, then a_n ≤ M for all n.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the function f(x) = sqrt(2)^x. The sequence can be thought of as iteratively applying this function, starting with x = sqrt(2). We want to show that f(x) is an increasing function for x in the interval [sqrt(2), M] if the sequence is indeed increasing and bounded.

To show that f(x) is increasing, we can look at its derivative:

f&#x27;(x) = d/dx [sqrt(2)^x] = sqrt(2)^x * ln(sqrt(2))

Since sqrt(2) &gt; 1, ln(sqrt(2)) &gt; 0, and thus f&#x27;(x) &gt; 0 for all x &gt; 0. This means that f(x) is indeed an increasing function for x &gt; 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the boundedness. If the sequence is increasing and bounded above by M, then we must have:

sqrt(2)^M ≤ M

Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get:

M * ln(sqrt(2)) ≤ ln(M)

Since ln(sqrt(2)) &gt; 0, we can divide both sides by ln(sqrt(2)) to get:

M ≤ ln(M) / ln(sqrt(2))

This inequality must hold for M to be an upper bound of the sequence. However, as M grows larger, the right-hand side of the inequality grows slower than the left-hand side because ln(M) grows slower than M. This suggests that there might not be a finite upper bound M that satisfies this inequality.

To resolve this, let&#x27;s consider the limit of the sequence. Suppose the limit L exists. Then, by the definition of the sequence, we have:

L = sqrt(2)^L

Taking the logarithm of both sides gives us:

ln(L) = L * ln(sqrt(2))

Dividing both sides by ln(sqrt(2)), we get:

L = ln(L) / ln(sqrt(2))

This is the same inequality we derived for M. However, now we are looking for a fixed point L where the value of the sequence stabilizes. To find such an L, we need to solve the equation:

L = sqrt(2)^L

This is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved using elementary algebraic methods. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the solution. One way to do this is to iterate the function f(x) = sqrt(2)^x starting with an initial guess and continue until the value stabilizes.

Let&#x27;s start with x = sqrt(2) and iterate:

x_1 = sqrt(2)
x_2 = sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2))
x_3 = sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2)^(sqrt(2)))
...

We can continue this process until the difference between successive terms is smaller than a chosen tolerance level, indicating that we have found an approximate fixed point.

However, without a computer or calculator, we cannot easily find this fixed point. We can only say that if the sequence is increasing and bounded, then it will converge to some limit L that satisfies L = sqrt(2)^L. If the sequence is not bounded, then it will diverge.

Given the complexity of the transcendental equation, it&#x27;s likely that the sequence is not bounded and thus does not converge to a finite limit. However, without a rigorous proof of the boundedness or lack thereof, we cannot definitively conclude the behavior of the sequence.</code></pre>
