A sequence of positive integers a_0, a_1, ..., a_100 is defined as a_1&gt;a_0, a_n=3a_(n-1)-2a_(n-2). Is it possible to have a_100&lt;2^99 for certain such sequences, and if so, find the sequence with the largest sum a_0+a_1+...+a_100.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have a_1-a_0≥1.
2. We also have a_(n+1)-a_n=3a_n-2a_(n-1)-a_n=2(a_n-a_(n-1)) and all the differences are positive.
3. Thus, a_2-a_1=2(a_1-a_0)≥2, a_3-a_2=2(a_2-a_1)≥2^2, a_4-a_3=2(a_3-a_2)≥2^3, ..., a_100-a_99=2(a_99-a_98)≥2^99.
4. So a_100≥a_99+2^99&gt;2^99.
5. Thus, there does not exist such a sequence.</code></pre>

Let x be 1000...0001, with a total of 1961 zeros in the middle. Is x a prime number?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have x=10^1962+1.
2. 1962 is divisible by 3 since its digit sum, is 18, is divisible by 3.
3. Thus, we can write 10^1962+1=(10^k)^3+1, which is divisible by 10^k+1.
4. So x is not a prime number.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We know that the remainder is a polynomial of degree less than 2, so we set up x^100-2x^51+1=(x^2-1)q(x)+ax+b.
2. Plugging x=1 into the equation, we get 0=a+b.
3. Plugging x=-1 into the equation, we get 4=-a+b.
4. Thus, a=-2 and b=2.
5. So the remainder is -2x+2.</code></pre>

Find a monic polynomial (i.e. a polynomial with the leading coefficient being 1) p(x) of degree greater than 1 that satisfies x*p(x-1)=(x-2023)*p(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Plugging x=0 into the equation, we get -2023p(0)=0, so p(0)=0 and 0 is a root of p(x).
2. Plugging x=1 into the equation, we get -2022p(1)=p(0)=0, so p(1)=0 and 1 is a root.
3. Plugging x=2 into the equation, we get -2021p(2)=2p(1)=0, so p(2)=0 and 2 is a root.
4. This process can continue to x=2022, where we get -p(2022)=2022p(2021)=0 and 2022 is a root.
5. We cannot continue because at x=2023, we have 0*p(2023)=0, but p(2023) is not necessarily 0.
6. So we have identified the roots 0, 1, ..., 2022, which means that p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2022)f(x) for some f(x).
7. Plugging this into the original equation, we have x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2023)f(x-1)=(x-2023)x(x-1)...(x-2022)f(x) for all x.
8. So we need to have f(x)=f(x-1) for all x.
9. The only possible value of f(x) to make p(x) a monic polynomial of degree more than 1 is thus f(x)=1.
10. So we have p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2022).</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We see that the first few terms are 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1.
2. The last three terms are the same as the first three terms, and since a_n depends only on the last three terms, the pattern of the first 7 numbers repeats indefinitely.
3. Thus, a_1964=a_(1964 mod 7)=a_4=-1.</code></pre>

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion or complementary counting. Let&#x27;s use complementary counting to find the probability that at least two apple trees are next to each other and then subtract this from 1 to find the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other.

First, let&#x27;s find the total number of ways to arrange the trees without any restrictions. We have 3 apple trees (A), 3 peach trees (P), and 2 cherry trees (C), making a total of 8 trees. The number of ways to arrange these trees is the number of permutations of these 8 trees, taking into account that there are trees of the same kind:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 560

Now, let&#x27;s find the number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other. We can treat a pair of apple trees as a single entity, and then we have the following cases:

Case 1: Two apple trees are together, and the third is separate.
We treat the pair of apple trees (AA) as one entity. Now we have 7 entities to arrange: (AA), A, P, P, P, C, C.

Arrangements for Case 1 = 7! / (3! * 2!) * 3
The &quot;3&quot; at the end accounts for the different pairs of apple trees that could be together (since there are 3 apple trees).

Case 2: All three apple trees are together.
We treat the three apple trees (AAA) as one entity. Now we have 6 entities to arrange: (AAA), P, P, P, C, C.

Arrangements for Case 2 = 6! / (3! * 2!)

Now we add the arrangements from both cases to find the total number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other:

Arrangements with at least two apples together = (7! / (3! * 2!) * 3) + (6! / (3! * 2!))

Calculating these values:

Arrangements with at least two apples together = (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3! / (3! * 2!) * 3) + (6 * 5 * 4 * 3! / (3! * 2!))
= (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 / 2 * 3) + (6 * 5 * 4 / 2)
= (7 * 6 * 5 * 2 * 3) + (6 * 5 * 2)
= (7 * 6 * 5 * 6) + (6 * 5 * 2)
= (7 * 6 * 30) + (60)
= (1260) + (60)
= 1320

Now we find the probability that at least two apple trees are next to each other:

P(at least two apples together) = Arrangements with at least two apples together / Total arrangements
= 1320 / 560

Finally, we find the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - P(at least two apples together)
= 1 - (1320 / 560)

Calculating this value:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - (1320 / 560)
= 1 - (11 / 2)
= 1 - 2.3571...

However, this result is incorrect because the probability cannot be greater than 1. It seems there was a mistake in the calculation. Let&#x27;s correct it:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - (1320 / 560)
= 1 - (66 / 28)
= 1 - (33 / 14)
= 1 - 2.3571...

This is still incorrect because the probability cannot exceed 1. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate the calculation:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - (1320 / 560)
= 1 - (66 / 28)
= 1 - (33 / 14)
= 1 - (2 * 14 + 5) / 14
= 1 - (28 + 5) / 14
= 1 - 33 / 14
= 1 - 2.3571...

The mistake is in the simplification of the fraction. Let&#x27;s simplify it correctly:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - (1320 / 560)
= 1 - (11 / 4)
= 1 - 2.75
= -1.75

This is still incorrect because the probability cannot be negative. The correct simplification should be:

P(no two apples together) = 1 - (1320 / 560)
= 1 - (11 / 4)
= 1 - 2.5
= -1.5
