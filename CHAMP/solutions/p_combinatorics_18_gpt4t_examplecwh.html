<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

1+2+...+n=n(n+1)/2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The formula you&#x27;ve provided is the sum of the first n natural numbers, which is known as the arithmetic series. To apply this concept, let&#x27;s calculate the sum of the first 10 natural numbers:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10

Using the formula:

n(n + 1)/2

we substitute n with 10:

10(10 + 1)/2 = 10 * 11 / 2 = 110 / 2 = 55

So, the sum of the first 10 natural numbers is 55.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described seems to be a bit off. If you have n actions, each with a certain number of ways to perform it, and you can only perform one action at a time, you don&#x27;t simply add the number of ways to perform each action to get the total number of ways to perform one action. Instead, you would add them to get the total number of ways to perform any one of the actions, not the sequence of all actions.

However, if you want to perform all n actions in sequence, and each action has a specific number of ways it can be performed independently of the others, then you would multiply the number of ways to perform each action to get the total number of ways to perform the sequence of actions. This is due to the rule of product in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of actions and each action can be performed in a number of ways independent of the others, the total number of ways to perform all actions in sequence is the product of the number of ways to perform each action.

Let&#x27;s correct the concept and then apply it:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and the actions are performed in sequence (one after another), then there are p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n ways to perform all the actions in total.

Example:

Suppose you have 3 actions to perform:

1. Choosing an outfit from 4 different options.
2. Selecting a pair of shoes from 3 different pairs.
3. Picking a hat from 2 different hats.

To find the total number of ways to perform all three actions (choose an outfit, then shoes, then a hat), you would multiply the number of ways to perform each action:

p_1 * p_2 * p_3 = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24

So, there are 24 different ways to choose an outfit, a pair of shoes, and a hat from the given options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many different ordered triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers are there such that a+b+c=99?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For any given value of c, how many possible values can (a, b) take?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of stars and bars, which is a combinatorial method to determine the number of ways to distribute indistinguishable items into distinguishable bins.

In this case, we want to distribute 99 indistinguishable units (which could represent things like points, counters, etc.) into 3 distinguishable bins (labeled as a, b, and c) such that the sum of the units in the bins is 99. The bins represent the values of a, b, and c, and since a, b, and c are non-negative integers, we can have zero units in one or more bins.

Using stars and bars, we can represent the 99 units as stars (*) and use 2 bars (|) to divide them into 3 sections. Each section between the bars (or between the end and a bar) represents the number of units in one of the bins.

For example, a configuration like this:

**|*******|*********

Would represent a = 2, b = 7, c = 90.

Since we have 99 units to distribute, we will have 99 stars. We need 2 bars to create 3 sections. The total number of symbols (stars and bars) will be 99 + 2 = 101.

Now, we need to choose 2 positions out of these 101 to place the bars. The number of ways to do this is given by the binomial coefficient &quot;101 choose 2&quot;, which is calculated as:

C(101, 2) = 101! / (2! * (101 - 2)!)

Simplifying this, we get:

C(101, 2) = 101! / (2! * 99!)
           = (101 * 100) / (2 * 1)
           = 101 * 50
           = 5050

So, there are 5050 different ordered triples (a, b, c) of non-negative integers such that a + b + c = 99.</code></pre>
