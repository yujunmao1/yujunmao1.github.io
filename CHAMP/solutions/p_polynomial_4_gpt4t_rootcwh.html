<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study the positivity of P(x) when x≤0.
2. For x&gt;0, study the positivity of x*P(x)+P(x).
3. a+a*r+a*r^2+...+a*r^n=a(1-r^(n+1))/(1-r), a+a*r+a*r^2+...=a/(1-r).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the polynomial P(x) and determine for how many values of n it has at least one real-valued root. Let&#x27;s follow the hints provided.

1. Study the positivity of P(x) when x ≤ 0.

For x ≤ 0, all the terms of the form \(x^{2k}\) where k is a non-negative integer will be non-negative because an even power of a non-positive number is non-negative. The terms of the form \(x^{2k-1}\) will be non-positive because an odd power of a non-positive number is non-positive. Since the coefficients of the \(x^{2k}\) terms are positive and the coefficients of the \(x^{2k-1}\) terms are negative, every term in P(x) will be non-negative when x ≤ 0. Additionally, the constant term 2n+1 is always positive. Therefore, P(x) is strictly positive for x ≤ 0.

2. For x &gt; 0, study the positivity of x*P(x) + P(x).

Let&#x27;s consider the expression x*P(x) + P(x). This can be written as:

x*P(x) + P(x) = x*(x^(2n) - 2x^(2n-1) + 3x^(2n-2) - ... - 2nx + 2n+1) + (x^(2n) - 2x^(2n-1) + 3x^(2n-2) - ... - 2nx + 2n+1)

Simplifying, we get:

x*P(x) + P(x) = (x+1)*(x^(2n) - 2x^(2n-1) + 3x^(2n-2) - ... - 2nx + 2n+1)

Now, let&#x27;s look at the terms inside the parentheses. We can see that the terms form an alternating series with increasing powers of x. The coefficients are increasing by 1 in magnitude, and the signs are alternating. This series resembles the sum of a geometric series with alternating signs.

3. Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

The sum of a geometric series is given by:

a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... + a*r^n = a(1 - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r), for r ≠ 1

In our case, the series is alternating, so we can consider r = -x. The first term a is x^(2n), and the series goes down to the linear term -2nx. However, the series does not fit the geometric series formula exactly because the coefficients are not the same for all terms. Instead, they increase linearly. This means we cannot directly apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

However, we can still analyze the behavior of the terms. For x &gt; 0, the terms with even powers of x will be positive, and the terms with odd powers of x will be negative. The magnitude of the coefficients increases as the power of x decreases. This means that for sufficiently large x, the positive terms will dominate, and x*P(x) + P(x) will be positive.

Since P(x) is strictly positive for x ≤ 0 and x*P(x) + P(x) is positive for sufficiently large x, we need to determine if there is a value of x &gt; 0 where P(x) could be zero or negative.

Let&#x27;s consider the derivative of P(x), P&#x27;(x). The derivative will tell us about the increasing or decreasing behavior of P(x). If P&#x27;(x) is always positive for x &gt; 0, then P(x) is strictly increasing, and since P(0) = 2n+1 &gt; 0, P(x) will never be zero or negative for x &gt; 0.

P&#x27;(x) = 2n*x^(2n-1) - 2*(2n-1)*x^(2n-2) + 3*(2n-2)*x^(2n-3) - ... - 2n

For x &gt; 0, the terms of P&#x27;(x) are alternating in sign, similar to P(x). However, the magnitude of the coefficients is decreasing as the power of x decreases. This means that for sufficiently small x &gt; 0, the negative terms could dominate, suggesting that P&#x27;(x) could be negative, indicating that P(x) could have a local maximum and potentially be zero or negative for some x &gt; 0.

To determine if P&#x27;(x) can be negative, we need to find if there is an x &gt; 0 such that the sum of the negative terms outweighs the sum of the positive terms. This is a non-trivial task and requires a more detailed analysis of the coefficients and powers of x.

However, we can make a general observation: if P&#x27;(x) has a real root for x &gt; 0, then P(x) has a local maximum at that point. If P(x) is positive at x = 0 and has a local maximum for some x &gt; 0, then it must cross the x-axis at least once, which means P(x) has at least one real root.

Since the problem asks for how many values of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) have at least one real-valued root, we need to find for which values of n the polynomial P(x) is not strictly increasing for x &gt; 0.

Given the complexity of the polynomial and the alternating nature of the terms, it is not straightforward to determine the exact number of n values for which P(x) has a real root without further detailed analysis or computational assistance. However, we can conjecture that for most values of n, P(x) will have at least one real root because the alternating series suggests that P&#x27;(x) will have real roots for x &gt; 0, leading to P(x) having real roots as well.

To provide a more precise answer, we would need to perform a detailed analysis of P&#x27;(x) for each value of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}, which is beyond the scope of this explanation. If computational tools are allowed, one could use a computer algebra system to analyze P&#x27;(x) for each n and determine the exact number of n values for which P(x) has at least one real root.</code></pre>
