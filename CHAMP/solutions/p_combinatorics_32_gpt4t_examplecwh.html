<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider an example where you have free time during the weekend and you want to choose an activity to do on Saturday. You have several options, but you can only do one activity due to time constraints.

Action 1: Watch a movie.
- You have 3 movies you&#x27;re interested in watching.

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.

Action 2: Read a book.
- You have 2 new books to choose from.

There are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.

Action 3: Go for a hike.
- There are 4 different trails nearby.

There are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

Action 4: Visit a friend.
- You have 5 friends you could potentially visit.

There are p_4 = 5 ways to perform the fourth action.

Since you can only choose one activity to do on Saturday, the total number of ways you can spend your time is the sum of the ways to perform each individual action:

Total number of ways to spend Saturday = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4
                                        = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5
                                        = 14

So, there are 14 different ways you could choose to spend your Saturday, given these activity options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let H(n, r) represent the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups (where horses in each group are tied).
2. Find H(n, 1).
3. Find H(n, r) as a function of H(n-1, r-1) and H(n-1, r).
4. Express the number of finishes P(n) for n horses in terms of H(n, r).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the provided information and the concept of partitions (groups) to determine the number of ways 4 horses can finish a race with the possibility of ties.

1. H(n, r) represents the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups.

2. H(n, 1) is the number of ways n horses can finish if there are no ties, which means all horses finish in a single group. This is simply 1 way because there is only one way to have all horses tied for the same place.

So, H(n, 1) = 1 for any n.

3. To find H(n, r) as a function of H(n-1, r-1) and H(n-1, r), we consider two cases for the nth horse:
   - The nth horse finishes in a new group by itself. There are H(n-1, r-1) ways for the first n-1 horses to finish in r-1 groups, and then we add the nth horse as a new group.
   - The nth horse finishes in a group with other horses. There are H(n-1, r) ways for the first n-1 horses to finish in r groups, and the nth horse can join any of these r groups.

Therefore, H(n, r) = H(n-1, r-1) + r * H(n-1, r).

4. The number of finishes P(n) for n horses is the sum of the number of ways the horses can finish in r groups, for r ranging from 1 to n:

P(n) = H(n, 1) + H(n, 2) + ... + H(n, n).

Now, let&#x27;s calculate P(4) for 4 horses:

- H(4, 1) = 1 (all horses tied in one group).
- H(4, 2) = H(3, 1) + 2 * H(3, 2) (either the 4th horse finishes in a new group, or it joins one of the 2 groups formed by the first 3 horses).
- H(4, 3) = H(3, 2) + 3 * H(3, 3) (either the 4th horse finishes in a new group, or it joins one of the 3 groups formed by the first 3 horses).
- H(4, 4) = H(3, 3) + 4 * H(3, 4) (either the 4th horse finishes in a new group, or it joins one of the 4 groups formed by the first 3 horses).

We already know that H(n, 1) = 1 for any n, so we can fill in some values:

- H(3, 1) = 1
- H(3, 2) = H(2, 1) + 2 * H(2, 2) = 1 + 2 * 1 = 3 (since H(2, 1) = 1 and H(2, 2) = 1).
- H(3, 3) = H(2, 2) + 3 * H(2, 3) = 1 + 3 * 1 = 4 (since H(2, 2) = 1 and H(2, 3) = 1).

Now we can calculate H(4, 2), H(4, 3), and H(4, 4):

- H(4, 2) = H(3, 1) + 2 * H(3, 2) = 1 + 2 * 3 = 7.
- H(4, 3) = H(3, 2) + 3 * H(3, 3) = 3 + 3 * 4 = 15.
- H(4, 4) = H(3, 3) + 4 * H(3, 4) = 4 + 4 * 1 = 8 (since H(3, 4) = 1, as there&#x27;s only one way for 3 horses to finish in 4 groups, which is not possible, so it&#x27;s considered as each horse in its own group).

Finally, we can find P(4):

P(4) = H(4, 1) + H(4, 2) + H(4, 3) + H(4, 4)
     = 1 + 7 + 15 + 8
     = 31.

Therefore, there are 31 different ways for 4 horses to finish a race with the possibility of ties.</code></pre>
