<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 5 rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles (i.e., a 2 x 2 tile without a corner).

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a_n be the number of ways to tile a 2 x n rectangle.
2. Find the expression for a_(n+1) in terms of a_n, a_(n-1) and a_(n-2).
3. Find a_1, a_2 and a_3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to establish a recursive relationship for a_n, which represents the number of ways to tile a 2 x n rectangle. We will then use this relationship to find a_5, since we are interested in a 2 x 5 rectangle.

First, let&#x27;s find a_1, a_2, and a_3.

a_1: There is only one way to tile a 2 x 1 rectangle, which is by placing two 1 x 1 tiles vertically. So, a_1 = 1.

a_2: There are two ways to tile a 2 x 2 rectangle. You can either place four 1 x 1 tiles or one single 2 x 2 L-shaped tile. So, a_2 = 2.

a_3: For a 2 x 3 rectangle, we can tile it in the following ways:
- Place three 2 x 1 vertical tiles (1 way).
- Place one 2 x 2 L-shaped tile at either end and fill the remaining space with 1 x 1 tiles (2 ways).
- Place one 2 x 1 vertical tile in the middle and a 2 x 2 L-shaped tile on either side (2 ways).
So, a_3 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

Now, let&#x27;s find the recursive formula for a_(n+1). To tile a 2 x (n+1) rectangle, we can consider the following cases:

1. Place a 2 x 1 tile vertically at the end. The remaining part to be tiled is a 2 x n rectangle. There are a_n ways to do this.
2. Place a 2 x 2 L-shaped tile at the end. The remaining part to be tiled is a 2 x (n-1) rectangle. There are a_(n-1) ways to do this.
3. Place a 2 x 2 L-shaped tile at the end, and then another L-shaped tile that shares a 1 x 1 tile with the first L-shaped tile. The remaining part to be tiled is a 2 x (n-2) rectangle. There are a_(n-2) ways to do this.

Therefore, the recursive formula is:
a_(n+1) = a_n + a_(n-1) + a_(n-2)

Now we can find a_4 and a_5 using the values we have for a_1, a_2, and a_3.

a_4 = a_3 + a_2 + a_1
a_4 = 5 + 2 + 1
a_4 = 8

a_5 = a_4 + a_3 + a_2
a_5 = 8 + 5 + 2
a_5 = 15

So, there are 15 ways to fill a 2 x 5 rectangle with 1 x 1 tiles and three-cell L-shaped tiles.</code></pre>
