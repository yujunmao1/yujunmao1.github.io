Find a perfect square number that can be written as aabb (i.e., first two digits are the same, and last two digits are the same).

You may find the following information useful:

1. If a | b and c | d, then ac | bd.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find a perfect square number of the form aabb, we can express this number as:

aabb = 1100a + 11b

Since we are looking for a perfect square, we can also express this as:

aabb = (100a + b)^2

However, we know that a perfect square must have an even number of each prime factor. The number 11 is prime, and it appears in the factorization of aabb. Therefore, both 100a and b must be multiples of 11 for their square to be a multiple of 11^2, which is necessary for aabb to be a perfect square.

Let&#x27;s express 100a and b as multiples of 11:

100a = 11 * 9a (since 100 is not a multiple of 11, a must be a multiple of 11 for 100a to be a multiple of 11)
b = 11c (where c is an integer)

Now, we can rewrite aabb as:

aabb = 1100 * 9a + 11 * 11c
aabb = 11 * (100 * 9a + 11c)

For aabb to be a perfect square, (100 * 9a + 11c) must also be a perfect square. Since 100 * 9a is a multiple of 11, c must also be a multiple of 11 for 11c to be a multiple of 11^2.

Let&#x27;s set c = 1 (the smallest non-zero integer multiple of 11 is 11 itself), and find the corresponding value of a:

b = 11c = 11 * 1 = 11

Now we need to find a value of a such that 100 * 9a + 11c is a perfect square. Since c = 1, we have:

100 * 9a + 11 = 900a + 11

We know that a must be a multiple of 11, so let&#x27;s try the smallest non-zero multiple, which is 11:

a = 11

Now let&#x27;s check if 900a + 11 is a perfect square:

900a + 11 = 900 * 11 + 11 = 9900 + 11 = 9911

9911 is not a perfect square, so we need to try a larger multiple of 11 for a. Let&#x27;s try a = 22:

a = 22

900a + 11 = 900 * 22 + 11 = 19800 + 11 = 19811

19811 is not a perfect square either. We can continue this process, but to save time, let&#x27;s consider the constraints on a and b. Since a and b are digits, they must be between 0 and 9. We already established that a must be a multiple of 11, but since a is a digit, the only possibility is a = 0. However, this would not give us a four-digit number.

Therefore, we need to reconsider our approach. Since aabb is a four-digit number, a cannot be 0. We also know that aabb is divisible by 11, so it must satisfy the divisibility rule for 11, where the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is a multiple of 11.

Let&#x27;s apply this rule to aabb:

(a + b) - (a + b) = 0

This means that any number of the form aabb will be divisible by 11, which is consistent with our earlier observation.

Now, let&#x27;s find a perfect square. We know that the last two digits of a perfect square can only be certain combinations, due to the way squaring works. The last two digits of a perfect square (when considered independently) must themselves form a perfect square when the number is considered modulo 100. The possible last two digits for perfect squares (00, 01, 04, 09, 16, 21, 24, 25, 29, 36, 41, 44, 49, 56, 61, 64, 69, 76, 81, 84, 89, 96) are limited.

Since b is the last digit of our perfect square, it must be one of the last digits from the list above. Also, since we are looking for a number of the form aabb, b must be such that when doubled and multiplied by 11, it still results in a perfect square.

Let&#x27;s try b = 0 (which is a trivial case and would result in a number 00, which is not four digits). The next possible value for b that could work is b = 1, since 11 is a perfect square.

If b = 1, then we have:

aabb = 1100a + 11b = 1100a + 11

Now, we need to find a value for a such that aabb is a perfect square. Since we are looking for a digit, a can only be between 1 and 9. Let&#x27;s try to find a perfect square by trial and error, checking the perfect squares of numbers ending in 1, since the last digit of our perfect square is 1.

The perfect squares of numbers ending in 1 are:
- 1^2 = 01
- 11^2 = 121
- 21^2 = 441
- 31^2 = 961
- 41^2 = 1681
- 51^2 = 2601
- 61^2 = 3721
- 71^2 = 5041
- 81^2 = 6561
- 91^2 = 8281

Looking at these perfect squares, we see that 961 is a perfect square that fits the form aabb, where a = 9 and b = 6.

Therefore, the perfect square number of the form aabb is 961, and the number we are looking for is 9966.</code></pre>
