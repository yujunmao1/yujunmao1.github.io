What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We see that |12^m-5^n| cannot be 0 for positive m, n due to different parity.
2. Since gcd(12, 5)=1, we have gcd(12^m, 5^n)=1, so 12^m-5^n will not be divisible by factor of 12 or 5 (other than 1), i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
3. We first check if |12^m-5^n|=1 has a solution.
4. If 12^m-5^n=1, we have 5^n=12^m-1=(6^m+1)(6^m-1), but 6^m+1 ends in 7 and thus is not divisible by 5.
5. Since 5^n only has prime factor of 5, the equation has no solution.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |12^m-5^n|, we need to consider the possible values of m and n.

From step 2, we know that 12^m-5^n will not be divisible by factors of 12 or 5 (other than 1). This means that the difference will not be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

From step 4, we know that the equation 12^m-5^n=1 has no solution.

Therefore, we need to consider the next smallest possible difference, which is 2.

Let&#x27;s assume that 12^m-5^n=2.

Rearranging the equation, we have 12^m=2+5^n.

Since 2 is even and 5^n is odd, the right side of the equation will always be odd. This means that 12^m must also be odd.

The only way for 12^m to be odd is if m is even.

Let&#x27;s substitute m=2k, where k is a positive integer, into the equation:

12^(2k)=2+5^n.

Simplifying, we have (12^k)^2=2+5^n.

This means that (12^k)^2-2=5^n.

From step 2, we know that the difference (12^k)^2-2 will not be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Therefore, the next smallest possible difference is 3.

Let&#x27;s assume that 12^m-5^n=3.

Following the same logic as before, we can substitute m=2k into the equation:

12^(2k)=3+5^n.

This means that (12^k)^2-7=5^n.

From step 2, we know that the difference (12^k)^2-7 will not be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Therefore, the next smallest possible difference is 8.

Let&#x27;s assume that 12^m-5^n=8.

Following the same logic as before, we can substitute m=2k into the equation:

12^(2k)=8+5^n.

This means that (12^k)^2-8=5^n.

From step 2, we know that the difference (12^k)^2-8 will not be divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Therefore, the next smallest possible difference is 9.
