<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
In other words, you can add the remainders of two numbers and the sum will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
Similar to addition, you can subtract the remainders of two numbers and the difference will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
When you multiply two numbers, you can multiply their remainders to get the remainder of the product when divided by the modulus.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You cannot simply divide the remainders unless the number you are dividing by is coprime with the modulus (they share no common divisors other than 1). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), and c has a multiplicative inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / d) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
You can raise both sides of a congruence to a power, and the result will be congruent modulo n.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have modular inverses; an integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory, as well as in practical applications such as calculating the day of the week for a given date. It simplifies arithmetic for large numbers by dealing with their remainders and has properties that are useful in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.</code></pre>

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.
4. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
5. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
6. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
7. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
8. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
9. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive value of the absolute difference |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. Let&#x27;s go through the steps and hints provided:

1. **Expression equal to 0:**
   If |12^m - 5^n| = 0, then 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are coprime (they share no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions for m and n that satisfy this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. **Expression equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:**
   Since 5 and 12 are coprime, their powers will also be coprime. This means that the difference between their powers cannot be 1. We can also quickly check small values of m and n to see if the difference can be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, since 12^1 - 5^1 = 7 and 5^1 - 12^1 = -7, and the powers grow quite rapidly, it&#x27;s unlikely that we&#x27;ll find small differences like these for larger powers.

3. **gcd(a, b^n) = 1:**
   Since the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a coprime pair a and b raised to any power n is 1, and 12 and 5 are coprime, it follows that 12^m and 5^n will also be coprime for any positive integers m and n.

4. **12^m - 5^n = 1:**
   If 12^m - 5^n = 1, then 5^n would have to be one less than a power of 12. However, since 5^n is always one more than a multiple of 4 (because 5 ≡ 1 (mod 4)), and 12^m is always a multiple of 4 (because 12 ≡ 0 (mod 4)), their difference cannot be 1.

5. **5^n - 12^m = 1 (mod 3):**
   Considering the equation modulo 3, we have 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 12 ≡ 0 (mod 3). Therefore, 5^n ≡ 2^n (mod 3). For 5^n - 12^m to be 1, we need 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 3), which happens when n is even.

6. **Even n, factor 5^n - 1:**
   For even n, 5^n - 1 can be factored using the difference of squares: 5^n - 1 = (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). Both factors must be even, and at least one of them must be divisible by 4.

7. **Prime factor splitting:**
   Since 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we need to split the prime factors 2 and 3 among the two factors of 5^n - 1. However, since 5^n - 1 is always even, the factor of 2 is accounted for. The factor of 3 is more challenging because 3^m must divide one of the factors of 5^n - 1.

8. **Divisibility by 3:**
   The difference between the factors (5^(n/2) + 1) and (5^(n/2) - 1) is 2, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, only one of the factors can be divisible by 3.

9. **Study possible solutions:**
   We need to find the smallest m and n such that one of the factors of 5^n - 1 is divisible by 3^m. Since 5^2 - 1 = 24, which is divisible by 3, and 5^2 + 1 = 26, which is not divisible by 3, we have a potential solution with n = 2 and m = 1. This gives us |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13.

Given the constraints and the rapid growth of the powers, it&#x27;s reasonable to conjecture that |12^m - 5^n| = 13 might be the smallest positive value for the absolute difference for positive integers m and n. However, without a systematic search through all possible values, we cannot be absolutely certain. The problem as stated seems to be a number-theoretic puzzle that may require deeper analysis or computational verification to find the smallest value with certainty.</code></pre>
