<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m, we can consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.

Let&#x27;s consider two cases:

Case 1: n is even
If n is even, then one of the numbers (n-1) or (n+1) must be divisible by 2. Since they are consecutive numbers, one of them must be divisible by 2 and the other must be odd. Therefore, (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 2.

However, a^m is an integer power of a, and if a is odd, then a^m is also odd. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Case 2: n is odd
If n is odd, then both (n-1) and (n+1) are even. Since they are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4. Therefore, (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 8.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of a. Let a = p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pn^kn, where p1, p2, ..., pn are distinct prime numbers.

Since (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 8, it must have at least three factors of 2 in its prime factorization. This means that at least one of (n-1), n, or (n+1) must be divisible by 4.

If (n-1) is divisible by 4, then n is congruent to 1 modulo 4.
If n is divisible by 4, then (n+1) is congruent to 1 modulo 4.
If (n+1) is divisible by 4, then n is congruent to 3 modulo 4.

Therefore, n can only be congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1). Since (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by a^m, each prime factor of a must appear in the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) with a power of at least m.

Let&#x27;s consider the prime factor 2. Since (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 8, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) must be at least 3. This means that at least one of (n-1), n, or (n+1) must be divisible by 8.

If (n-1) is divisible by 8, then n is congruent to 1 modulo 8.
If n is divisible by 8, then (n+1) is congruent to 1 modulo 8.
If (n+1) is divisible by 8, then n is congruent to 7 modulo 8.

Therefore, n can only be congruent to 1, 3, or 7 modulo 8.

In summary, the possible congruences of n modulo 8 are 1, 3, or 7, and the possible congruences of n modulo 4 are 1 or 3.

Now, we need to check if these congruences are sufficient to satisfy the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m.

Let&#x27;s consider the case where n is congruent to 1 modulo 8 and congruent to 1 modulo 4. In this case, n can be written as n = 8k + 1 and n = 4m + 1 for some integers k and m.

Substituting these expressions into the equation, we get:
(8k + 1 - 1)(8k + 1)(8k + 1 + 1) = a^m
(8k)(8k + 1)(8k + 2) = a^m

Since 8k is divisible by 8, (8k)(8k + 1)(8k + 2) is divisible by 8. Therefore, a^m must also be divisible by 8.

Let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of a^m. Since a^m is divisible by 8, the power of 2 in the prime factorization of a^m must be at least 3. This means that a must be divisible by 2.

Therefore, if n is congruent to 1 modulo 8 and congruent to 1 modulo 4, then a must be divisible by 2.

Similarly, we can consider the other possible congruences of n modulo 8 and modulo 4, and we will find that a must be divisible by 2 in all cases.

Therefore, the possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m are given by:
n = 8k + 1 or 8k + 3, where k is an integer, and a is any positive integer divisible by 2.

Note: This solution assumes that a is a positive integer. If a can be any positive real number, then there are infinitely many solutions to the equation.</code></pre>
