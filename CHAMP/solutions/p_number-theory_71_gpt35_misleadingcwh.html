<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |12^m-5^n|, we can start by considering the possible values of the expression.

1. If the expression is equal to 0, then we have 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are coprime (they have no common factors), this equation has no solutions for positive integers m and n.

2. If the expression is equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, we can observe that 5 and 12 are coprime, so their difference can only be a multiple of 1. Therefore, these values are not possible.

3. For integer a, b, and odd n, we have the property that a + b divides a^n + b^n. Applying this property to our expression, we have 12^m + 5^n is divisible by 12 + 5 = 17.

4. To determine if the expression can be equal to 1, we can express 5^n in terms of m and study its factors. We have 5^n = 12^m - 1. Using the property mentioned in point 5, we can write 5^n - 1 = (12^m - 1) - 1 = 12^m - 2. Since 12^m - 2 is divisible by 2, it cannot be equal to 1.

5. Using the property mentioned in point 6, we can consider the equation modulo 3. We have 5^n ≡ 12^m (mod 3). Since 12 ≡ 0 (mod 3), we have 5^n ≡ 0 (mod 3). This means that n must be even.

6. For even n, we can factor 5^n - 1 as (5^(n/2) - 1)(5^(n/2) + 1). We can check the divisibility of these factors by 4. If both factors are divisible by 4, then the expression can be equal to 1. However, since 5^(n/2) ≡ 1 (mod 4), we have (5^(n/2) - 1) ≡ 0 (mod 4), and (5^(n/2) + 1) ≡ 2 (mod 4). Therefore, neither factor is divisible by 4, and the expression cannot be equal to 1.

7. We can express 12^m as 2^(2m) * 3^m. To split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1, we can set up the equation 2^(2m) * 3^m = 5^n - 1. 

8. We can check whether the factors P = 2^(2m) and Q = 3^m can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference. If P - Q is divisible by 3, then both factors can be divisible by 3. We have P - Q = 2^(2m) - 3^m. Since 2^(2m) ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 3^m ≡ 0 (mod 3), we have P - Q ≡ 1 (mod 3), which means that P - Q is not divisible by 3. Therefore, P and Q cannot both be divisible by 3.

9. From the previous step, we know that P and Q cannot both be divisible by 3. Therefore, one of them must be divisible by 2^2 = 4. Since P = 2^(2m), P is divisible by 4. This means that Q = 3^m must be divisible by 4. Since 3^m is always odd, m must be even.

10. We have determined that n must be even and m must be even. Let&#x27;s say n = 2x and m = 2y, where x and y are positive integers. Substituting these values into the equation 2^(2m) * 3^m = 5^n - 1, we have 2^(4y) * 3^(2y) = 5^(2x) - 1.

11. We can study possible solutions for the factor splitting. Since 2^(4y) * 3^(2y) = 5^(2x) - 1, we can consider the equation modulo 5. We have 2^(4y) * 3^(2y) ≡ (-1)^(2x) - 1 (mod 5). Simplifying, we have 2^(4y) * 3^(2y) ≡ 1 - 1 (mod 5), which means that 2^(4y) * 3^(2y) ≡ 0 (mod 5). This implies that at least one of the factors 2^(4y) or 3^(2y) must be divisible by 5.

12. Since 2^(4y) is not divisible by 5, we must have 3^(2y) divisible by 5. This means that 2y must be divisible by 1, which implies that y must be divisible by 1. Therefore, y can be any positive integer.

13. We have determined that m = 2y, where y is a positive integer. Substituting this into the expression |12^m - 5^n|, we have |12^(2y) - 5^(2x)|.

14. Since y can be any positive integer, we can choose y = 1 to minimize the value of |12^(2y) - 5^(2x)|. This gives us |12^2 - 5^(2x)| = |144 - 25^(2x)|.

15. To minimize the value further, we can choose x = 1. This gives us |144 - 25^2| = |144 - 625| = |-481| = 481.

Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is 481.</code></pre>
