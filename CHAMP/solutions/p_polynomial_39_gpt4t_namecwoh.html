<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Polynomial division is a process similar to long division for numbers, but it is used to divide one polynomial by another. The goal of polynomial division is to determine how many times the divisor polynomial can &quot;fit&quot; into the dividend polynomial, and to find the remainder if the division is not exact.

Here&#x27;s the definition and a brief explanation of the terms involved:

**Dividend**: The polynomial that is being divided. This is analogous to the number you start with in numerical long division.

**Divisor**: The polynomial by which you are dividing the dividend. In numerical division, this would be the number you divide by.

**Quotient**: The result of the division, representing how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend without considering the remainder.

**Remainder**: The part of the dividend that is left over after the division process has been completed. If the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor, the division process is complete.

The process of polynomial division can be done using long division or synthetic division (which is a shortcut method applicable when the divisor is a binomial of the form x - c).

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step outline of the long division process for polynomials:

1. Arrange both the dividend and the divisor polynomials in descending order of their degrees (the highest power of x comes first).

2. Divide the leading term (the term with the highest power of x) of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This gives you the first term of the quotient.

3. Multiply the entire divisor by the term you just found and subtract the result from the dividend. This gives you a new polynomial.

4. Repeat the process using the new polynomial as the dividend. Divide the leading term of the new polynomial by the leading term of the divisor to find the next term of the quotient.

5. Continue this process until the degree of the remainder polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor or until the remainder is zero.

6. The final quotient and remainder give you the result of the division, which can be expressed as:

   Dividend = (Divisor × Quotient) + Remainder

For example, if we want to divide the polynomial 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 by x - 2, we would use polynomial long division to find that the quotient is 2x^2 + 7x + 13 and the remainder is 21. So, the division can be expressed as:

   2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 = (x - 2)(2x^2 + 7x + 13) + 21

Polynomial division is useful in various areas of algebra, including simplifying rational expressions, finding polynomial roots, and solving polynomial equations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the remainder of x^1959−1 divided by (x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. The cube root of unity w=e^(i*pi/3) satisfies w+w^2+1=0 and w^n=w^(n mod 3).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the remainder of \( x^{1959} - 1 \) divided by \( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \), we can use the properties of complex numbers and the roots of unity.

First, let&#x27;s factor the divisor \( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \). The factor \( x^2 + 1 \) can be factored over the complex numbers as \( (x - i)(x + i) \), where \( i \) is the imaginary unit with the property \( i^2 = -1 \).

The factor \( x^2 + x + 1 \) is a bit trickier. It is associated with the cube roots of unity. The roots of this quadratic are the two non-real cube roots of unity, which we can denote as \( \omega \) and \( \omega^2 \), where \( \omega = e^{i\pi/3} \) and \( \omega^2 = e^{2i\pi/3} \). These satisfy the equation \( \omega^3 = 1 \) and the relation \( \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0 \).

Now, we want to find the remainder when \( x^{1959} - 1 \) is divided by \( (x - i)(x + i)(x - \omega)(x - \omega^2) \).

Since \( \omega \) and \( \omega^2 \) are roots of \( x^2 + x + 1 \), we have \( \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0 \) and \( (\omega^2)^2 + \omega^2 + 1 = 0 \). Similarly, \( i \) and \( -i \) are roots of \( x^2 + 1 \), so \( i^2 + 1 = 0 \) and \( (-i)^2 + 1 = 0 \).

The remainder will have a degree less than the divisor, which has a degree of 4. Therefore, the remainder can be written in the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \). To find the coefficients \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \), we can evaluate the remainder at the roots of the divisor.

Let&#x27;s evaluate \( x^{1959} - 1 \) at \( x = i \):
\( i^{1959} - 1 = (i^2)^{979} \cdot i - 1 = (-1)^{979} \cdot i - 1 = -i - 1 \)

Since \( i \) is a root of the divisor, \( -i - 1 \) must also be the value of the remainder at \( x = i \). This gives us one equation for the coefficients of the remainder.

Next, let&#x27;s evaluate \( x^{1959} - 1 \) at \( x = \omega \):
\( \omega^{1959} - 1 = \omega^{1959 \mod 3} - 1 = \omega^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)

Since \( \omega \) is a root of the divisor, the remainder must also be 0 at \( x = \omega \). This gives us another equation for the coefficients.

We can do the same for \( x = \omega^2 \), and we will also get 0 because \( \omega^2 \) is a root of the divisor.

Now we have the following system of equations for the remainder \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \):

1. \( ai^3 + bi^2 + ci + d = -i - 1 \)
2. \( a\omega^3 + b\omega^2 + c\omega + d = 0 \)
3. \( a(\omega^2)^3 + b(\omega^2)^2 + c\omega^2 + d = 0 \)

Since \( \omega^3 = 1 \) and \( (\omega^2)^3 = 1 \), equations 2 and 3 simplify to:

2. \( a + b\omega^2 + c\omega + d = 0 \)
3. \( a + b\omega + c\omega^2 + d = 0 \)

We also know that \( \omega + \omega^2 = -1 \) from the relation \( \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0 \).

Now, let&#x27;s solve the system of equations. We can use the fact that the remainder must be 0 at \( \omega \) and \( \omega^2 \) to conclude that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), \( c = 0 \), and \( d = 0 \). This is because the only polynomial that has more roots than its degree is the zero polynomial.

Therefore, the remainder of \( x^{1959} - 1 \) divided by \( (x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \) is simply \( 0 \).</code></pre>
