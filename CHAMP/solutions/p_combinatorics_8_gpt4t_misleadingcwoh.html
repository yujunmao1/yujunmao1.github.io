<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 5 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors (i.e., the string does not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings).

You may find the following information useful:

1. sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)=2^n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to count the number of strings of length 5 that consist of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the restriction that 1 and 2 cannot be adjacent.

Let&#x27;s break this down into cases based on the number of 1s and 2s in the string.

Case 1: No 1s or 2s
If there are no 1s or 2s, then each position in the string can only be a 3 or a 4. There are 2 choices for each of the 5 positions, so there are 2^5 = 32 such strings.

Case 2: One 1 or one 2, but not both
If there is exactly one 1 or one 2, then there are 5 positions where the 1 or 2 can be placed. For each of these positions, the remaining 4 positions can be filled with 3s or 4s. So there are 5 * 2^4 = 5 * 16 = 80 such strings for one 1 and the same number for one 2, giving a total of 80 + 80 = 160 strings.

Case 3: One 1 and one 2, not adjacent
If there is exactly one 1 and one 2, and they are not adjacent, we need to place them in the string such that there is at least one digit between them. There are 4 ways to place the 1 and 2 with one digit between them (1_2__, _1_2_, __1_2, 2_1__, _2_1_, __2_1), and for each of these, there are 2 choices for the digit between them and 2^2 choices for the remaining two digits, giving a total of 4 * 2 * 2^2 = 4 * 2 * 4 = 32 strings.

If there are two digits between the 1 and 2, there are 3 ways to place them (1__2_, _1__2, 2__1_, _2__1), and for each of these, there are 2^2 choices for the two digits between them and 2 choices for the remaining digit, giving a total of 3 * 2^2 * 2 = 3 * 4 * 2 = 24 strings.

If there are three digits between the 1 and 2, there are 2 ways to place them (1___2, 2___1), and for each of these, there are 2^3 choices for the three digits between them, giving a total of 2 * 2^3 = 2 * 8 = 16 strings.

Adding these up gives 32 + 24 + 16 = 72 strings for one 1 and one 2, not adjacent.

Case 4: More than one 1 or 2
If there are more than one 1 or 2, they must be separated by at least one other digit to avoid being adjacent. However, with a string of length 5, we cannot have more than two of either digit without them being adjacent. So we need to consider strings with two 1s and one 2, or two 2s and one 1, with the 1s and 2s not adjacent.

For two 1s and one 2, the 1s cannot be adjacent to each other or to the 2. There are 3 ways to place the 1s and 2 such that they are not adjacent (1_1_2, 1_2_1, 2_1_1), and for each of these, there are 2 choices for each of the two remaining positions, giving a total of 3 * 2^2 = 3 * 4 = 12 strings.

Similarly, for two 2s and one 1, there are also 3 ways to place the 2s and 1 such that they are not adjacent (2_2_1, 2_1_2, 1_2_2), and for each of these, there are 2 choices for each of the two remaining positions, giving another 12 strings.

Adding these up gives 12 + 12 = 24 strings for cases with more than one 1 or 2.

Adding up all the cases, we get:
Case 1: 32 strings
Case 2: 160 strings
Case 3: 72 strings
Case 4: 24 strings

Total number of strings = 32 + 160 + 72 + 24 = 288 strings

Therefore, there are 288 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that do not have any 1 and 2 as neighbors.</code></pre>
