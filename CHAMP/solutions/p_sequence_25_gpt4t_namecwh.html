<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r ≠ 1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Is it possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... such that the sum is 1/5, and if so, what is the sequence?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Assume that the geometric sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a ratio of 1/2^b.
2. Consider separately the cases of a=b, a&lt;b, a&gt;b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find an infinite geometric sequence within the given sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... that sums up to 1/5. We are told to assume that the geometric sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a common ratio of 1/2^b.

Let&#x27;s use the sum to infinity formula for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. In our case, the first term is 1/2^a and the common ratio is 1/2^b. We want the sum to be 1/5:

1/5 = (1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the three cases separately:

1. Case a = b:
In this case, the common ratio r is 1/2^a. The sum to infinity formula becomes:

1/5 = (1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^a)

Multiplying both sides by (1 - 1/2^a) and then by 2^a, we get:

2^a / 5 = 1 - 1/2^a
2^a - 1/5 = 1
2^a = 1 + 1/5
2^a = 6/5

Since 2^a must be a power of 2, and 6/5 is not a power of 2, this case is not possible.

2. Case a &lt; b:
In this case, the common ratio r is smaller than the first term. The sum to infinity formula is still:

1/5 = (1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b)

Since a &lt; b, the denominator (1 - 1/2^b) is close to 1, but not equal to 1. This means that 1/2^a must be less than 1/5 for the equation to hold. However, since the sequence starts at 1/2, the smallest possible value for a is 1 (since the sequence starts at 1/2^a). This would make the first term 1/2, which is greater than 1/5. Therefore, this case is not possible either.

3. Case a &gt; b:
In this case, the common ratio r is larger than the first term. The sum to infinity formula is:

1/5 = (1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b)

Since a &gt; b, we can simplify the denominator to approximately 1, as 1/2^b will be a very small number. This gives us:

1/5 ≈ 1/2^a
2^a ≈ 5

Now, we need to find a value of a such that 1/2^a is close to 1/5. Since 2^2 = 4 and 2^3 = 8, and 5 is between 4 and 8, we can guess that a = 3 might work. Let&#x27;s check:

1/5 = (1/2^3) / (1 - 1/2^b)
1/5 = 1/8 / (1 - 1/2^b)
1/5 = 1/8 * (1 / (1 - 1/2^b))

Now we need to find a value of b such that the denominator equals 8/5. Let&#x27;s solve for b:

8/5 = 1 / (1 - 1/2^b)
8 - 8/2^b = 5
8/2^b = 3
2^b = 8/3
b = log2(8/3)
b = 3 - log2(3)

Since b must be an integer and 3 - log2(3) is not an integer, this case is also not possible.

Therefore, it is not possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the given sequence such that the sum is 1/5.</code></pre>
