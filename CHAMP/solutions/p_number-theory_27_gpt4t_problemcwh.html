<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Factorize x^4+x^2+1 into terms of integer coefficients.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^4+x^2+1=x^4+2x^2+1-x^2=(x^2+1)^2-x^2=(x^2+x+1)(x^2-x+1).

Problem: Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?
Step-wise solution:
1. Assume that there are only finitely many composite numbers.
2. This means that we can only use 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 finitely many times since numbers ending in them are composite.
3. In addition, number 1 and 7 can also only be used finitely many times since they increase the digit sum mod 3 by one, which means that adding them at most three times will result in a multiple of 3.
4. So we can only append 3 after a certain place.
5. We want to show that starting from a prime p, appending a certain number of 3s would produce a number that is a multiple of p.
6. For p, we have p | 10^p-10, and since gcd(10, p)=1, we have p | 10^(p-1)-1, which is 99...99 (with p-1 9s).
7. Thus, we have p | 33...33 since gcd(p, 3)=1.
8. So appending this sequence to p would result in a composite number, and repeating this process means that we have infinitely many composite numbers.

Problem: Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?
Step-wise solution:
1. We let d be the first digit of the k+1 digit number and r be the last k digits.
2. Thus, the original number is 10^k*d+r and the new number is r.
3. So we have 10^k*d+r=57r, which is 10^k*d=56r.
4. Thus, 56 | 10^k*d, which means 7 | 10^k*d and 8 | 10^k*d.
5. Since 10^k only has prime factors 2 and 5 and is not divisible by 7, we must have d=7.
6. So we need 8 | 10^k and the smallest k is 3.
7. Thus, we have 7000+r=57r, and r=125.
8. So the number that we are finding is 7125.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n be 22...22, with a total of 1980 digits. What is n mod 1982?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Find the expression for n by studying n/2*9.
2. 991 is a prime.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve for \( n \mod 1982 \), we first need to understand what \( n \) is. The number \( n \) is composed of 1980 digits, all of which are 2. We can express \( n \) as a sum of 2&#x27;s multiplied by powers of 10:

\[ n = 2 + 20 + 200 + 2000 + \ldots + 2 \cdot 10^{1978} + 2 \cdot 10^{1979} \]

This is a geometric series with the first term \( a = 2 \) and the common ratio \( r = 10 \). However, we can simplify this expression by considering the following:

\[ \frac{n}{9} = \frac{2}{9} + \frac{2}{9} \cdot 10 + \frac{2}{9} \cdot 10^2 + \ldots + \frac{2}{9} \cdot 10^{1978} + \frac{2}{9} \cdot 10^{1979} \]

This is a geometric series with the first term \( \frac{2}{9} \) and the common ratio \( 10 \). The sum of this series is:

\[ \frac{n}{9} = \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{1 - 10^{1980}}{1 - 10} \]

Multiplying both sides by 9 to solve for \( n \), we get:

\[ n = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 10^{1980}}{1 - 10} \]

\[ n = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 10^{1980}}{-9} \]

\[ n = \frac{2}{9} \cdot (10^{1980} - 1) \]

Now, we want to find \( n \mod 1982 \). Since 1982 is not a prime number, we can&#x27;t directly apply Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem. However, we can break down 1982 into its prime factors:

\[ 1982 = 2 \cdot 991 \]

We know that 991 is a prime number. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve for \( n \mod 1982 \) by finding \( n \mod 2 \) and \( n \mod 991 \) separately.

First, let&#x27;s find \( n \mod 2 \):

Since \( n \) is composed entirely of the digit 2, it is clearly an even number. Therefore, \( n \mod 2 = 0 \).

Next, let&#x27;s find \( n \mod 991 \):

We can use the fact that \( 10^{990} \equiv 1 \mod 991 \) by Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem since 991 is prime. Since 1980 is twice 990, we have:

\[ 10^{1980} \equiv (10^{990})^2 \mod 991 \]
\[ 10^{1980} \equiv 1^2 \mod 991 \]
\[ 10^{1980} \equiv 1 \mod 991 \]

Now we can find \( n \mod 991 \):

\[ n = \frac{2}{9} \cdot (10^{1980} - 1) \]
\[ n \equiv \frac{2}{9} \cdot (1 - 1) \mod 991 \]
\[ n \equiv 0 \mod 991 \]

Now we have \( n \mod 2 = 0 \) and \( n \mod 991 = 0 \). Since 2 and 991 are coprime, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to conclude that:

\[ n \mod 1982 = 0 \]

Therefore, \( n \) is divisible by 1982, and \( n \mod 1982 = 0 \).</code></pre>
