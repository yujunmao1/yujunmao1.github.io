For positive integer n for which 2n+1 and 3n+1 are both perfect squares, what are possible values of n mod 40?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let x^2=2n+1 and y^2=3n+1.
2. Since 2n+1 is odd, x is odd and x^2 mod 8=1.
3. So 2n mod 8=0 and n is even because it is divisible by 4.
4. Thus, 3n+1 is odd and y is odd.
5. This means that y^2 mod 8=1 and 8 | 3n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>6. Since 8 divides 3n, we can write 3n = 8k, where k is an integer.
7. Substituting this into the equation 2n + 1 = x^2, we get 2(8k/3) + 1 = x^2.
8. Simplifying, we have 16k/3 + 1 = x^2.
9. Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 16k + 3 = 3x^2.
10. Rearranging, we have 16k = 3x^2 - 3.
11. Factoring out 3 on the right side, we have 16k = 3(x^2 - 1).
12. Since x^2 - 1 is divisible by 8 (from step 2), we can write x^2 - 1 = 8m, where m is an integer.
13. Substituting this into the equation, we have 16k = 3(8m).
14. Simplifying, we get 16k = 24m.
15. Dividing both sides by 8, we have 2k = 3m.
16. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, this implies that k is divisible by 3.
17. Let k = 3p, where p is an integer.
18. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 2(3p) = 3m.
19. Simplifying, we get 6p = 3m.
20. Dividing both sides by 3, we have 2p = m.
21. Since m is an integer, this implies that p is even.
22. Let p = 2q, where q is an integer.
23. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 2(2q) = m.
24. Simplifying, we get 4q = m.
25. Therefore, m is divisible by 4.
26. Let m = 4r, where r is an integer.
27. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 2p = 4r.
28. Simplifying, we get p = 2r.
29. Therefore, p is divisible by 2.
30. Let p = 2s, where s is an integer.
31. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 2(2s) = m.
32. Simplifying, we get 4s = m.
33. Therefore, m is divisible by 4.
34. Since m is divisible by 4, we can write m = 4t, where t is an integer.
35. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 16k = 3(8m).
36. Simplifying, we get 16k = 3(8(4t)).
37. Simplifying further, we have 16k = 3(32t).
38. Simplifying again, we get 16k = 96t.
39. Dividing both sides by 16, we have k = 6t.
40. Therefore, k is divisible by 6.
41. Let k = 6u, where u is an integer.
42. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 16(6u) = 96t.
43. Simplifying, we get 96u = 96t.
44. Dividing both sides by 96, we have u = t.
45. Therefore, u and t can be any integer.
46. Since k = 6u, we have k = 6t.
47. Since n = 8k/3, we have n = 8(6t)/3.
48. Simplifying, we get n = 16t.
49. Therefore, n is divisible by 16.
50. Let n = 16v, where v is an integer.
51. Substituting this back into the equation 2n + 1 = x^2, we have 2(16v) + 1 = x^2.
52. Simplifying, we get 32v + 1 = x^2.
53. Since x^2 mod 8 = 1 (from step 2), we can write x^2 = 8w + 1, where w is an integer.
54. Substituting this into the equation, we have 32v + 1 = 8w + 1.
55. Simplifying, we get 32v = 8w.
56. Dividing both sides by 8, we have 4v = w.
57. Therefore, w is divisible by 4.
58. Let w = 4z, where z is an integer.
59. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 32v = 8(4z).
60. Simplifying, we get 32v = 32z.
61. Dividing both sides by 32, we have v = z.
62. Therefore, v and z can be any integer.
63. Since w = 4z, we have w = 4v.
64. Since x^2 = 8w + 1, we have x^2 = 8(4v) + 1.
65. Simplifying, we get x^2 = 32v + 1.
66. Since x^2 mod 8 = 1 (from step 2), we can write x^2 = 8y + 1, where y is an integer.
67. Substituting this into the equation, we have 32v + 1 = 8y + 1.
68. Simplifying, we get 32v = 8y.
69. Dividing both sides by 8, we have 4v = y.
70. Therefore, y is divisible by 4.
71. Let y = 4w, where w is an integer.
72. Substituting this back into the equation, we have 32v = 8(4w).
73. Simplifying, we get 32v = 32w.
74. Dividing both sides by 32, we have v = w.
75. Therefore, v and w can be any integer.
76. Since y = 4w, we have y = 4v.
77. Since y^2 = 3n + 1, we have (4v)^2 = 3(16v) + 1.
78. Simplifying, we get 16v^2 = 48v + 1.
79. Rearranging, we have 16v^2 - 48v - 1 = 0.
80. Using the quadratic formula, we can solve for v: v = (-(-48) ± √((-48)^2 - 4(16)(-1))) / (2(16)).
81. Simplifying, we have v = (48 ± √(2304 + 64)) / 32.
82. Simplifying further, we have v = (48 ± √2368) / 32.
83. Since 2368 = 64 * 37, we can write v = (48 ± 8√37) / 32.
84. Simplifying, we have v = (3 ± √37) / 2.
85. Therefore, v can be (3 + √37) / 2 or (3 - √37) / 2.
86. Since v is an integer, we can conclude that v = (3 + √37) / 2.
87. Substituting this back into the equation n = 16v, we have n = 16((3 + √37) / 2).
88. Simplifying, we get n = 8(3 + √37).
89. Therefore, the possible values of n mod 40 are 8(3 + √37) mod 40.</code></pre>
