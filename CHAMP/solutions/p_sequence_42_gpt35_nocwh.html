<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

1324 persons are arranged in a circle and numbered from 1 to 1324. Then every 2nd person is removed (i.e., the first four removed people are those numbered 2, 4, 6 and 8) until there is only one person left. What is the number of the last person left?

You may find the following information useful:

1. If there are 2^m people, which one will be the last person left?
2. For 2^m+k people (with k&lt;2^m), what happens when there are exactly 2^m people left?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the information provided.

1. If there are 2^m people, the last person left will be the person numbered 1. This means that if the number of people is a power of 2, the last person left will always be numbered 1.

2. For 2^m+k people (with k&lt;2^m), when there are exactly 2^m people left, the same process will repeat. This means that the last person left will be the same as the last person left when there are 2^m people.

Now let&#x27;s apply this information to the given problem.

The number of people, 1324, is not a power of 2. However, we can find the largest power of 2 that is less than 1324, which is 2^10 = 1024. This means that when there are exactly 1024 people left, the same process will repeat.

To find the last person left when there are 1024 people, we can use the information from point 1. The last person left will be numbered 1.

Now, we need to determine what happens when there are exactly 1024 people left. We can subtract 1024 from 1324 to find the remaining number of people, which is 300.

Since 300 is not a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 300, which is 2^8 = 256. This means that when there are exactly 256 people left, the same process will repeat.

Again, using the information from point 1, the last person left when there are 256 people will be numbered 1.

Now, we need to determine what happens when there are exactly 256 people left. We can subtract 256 from 300 to find the remaining number of people, which is 44.

Since 44 is not a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 44, which is 2^5 = 32. This means that when there are exactly 32 people left, the same process will repeat.

Using the information from point 1, the last person left when there are 32 people will be numbered 1.

Now, we need to determine what happens when there are exactly 32 people left. We can subtract 32 from 44 to find the remaining number of people, which is 12.

Since 12 is not a power of 2, we need to find the largest power of 2 that is less than 12, which is 2^3 = 8. This means that when there are exactly 8 people left, the same process will repeat.

Using the information from point 1, the last person left when there are 8 people will be numbered 1.

Now, we need to determine what happens when there are exactly 8 people left. We can subtract 8 from 12 to find the remaining number of people, which is 4.

Since 4 is a power of 2, we can use the information from point 1. The last person left when there are 4 people will be numbered 1.

Finally, we need to determine what happens when there are exactly 4 people left. We can subtract 4 from 4 to find the remaining number of people, which is 0.

Since there are no people left, we have reached the end of the process.

Therefore, the number of the last person left is 1.</code></pre>
