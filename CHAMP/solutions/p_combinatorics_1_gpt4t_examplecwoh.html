<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of strings of length 6 where each pair of adjacent digits differs by at most 1. This means that for any digit in the string, the next digit can either be the same, one less, or one more, provided it is within the set {1, 2, 3}.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid strings of length n that end with the digit i as S(n, i). We want to find the total number of valid strings of length 6, which is S(6, 1) + S(6, 2) + S(6, 3).

To build up to this, we start with strings of length 1 and work our way up.

For n = 1, we have:
S(1, 1) = 1 (the string &quot;1&quot;)
S(1, 2) = 1 (the string &quot;2&quot;)
S(1, 3) = 1 (the string &quot;3&quot;)

For n = 2, we consider the possible predecessors for each ending digit:
S(2, 1) can be preceded by 1 or 2, so S(2, 1) = S(1, 1) + S(1, 2) = 1 + 1 = 2
S(2, 2) can be preceded by 1, 2, or 3, so S(2, 2) = S(1, 1) + S(1, 2) + S(1, 3) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
S(2, 3) can be preceded by 2 or 3, so S(2, 3) = S(1, 2) + S(1, 3) = 1 + 1 = 2

For n = 3 and beyond, we use the same logic:
S(n, 1) = S(n-1, 1) + S(n-1, 2)
S(n, 2) = S(n-1, 1) + S(n-1, 2) + S(n-1, 3)
S(n, 3) = S(n-1, 2) + S(n-1, 3)

Now we can build up to n = 6 using the above recurrence relations:

For n = 3:
S(3, 1) = S(2, 1) + S(2, 2) = 2 + 3 = 5
S(3, 2) = S(2, 1) + S(2, 2) + S(2, 3) = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
S(3, 3) = S(2, 2) + S(2, 3) = 3 + 2 = 5

For n = 4:
S(4, 1) = S(3, 1) + S(3, 2) = 5 + 7 = 12
S(4, 2) = S(3, 1) + S(3, 2) + S(3, 3) = 5 + 7 + 5 = 17
S(4, 3) = S(3, 2) + S(3, 3) = 7 + 5 = 12

For n = 5:
S(5, 1) = S(4, 1) + S(4, 2) = 12 + 17 = 29
S(5, 2) = S(4, 1) + S(4, 2) + S(4, 3) = 12 + 17 + 12 = 41
S(5, 3) = S(4, 2) + S(4, 3) = 17 + 12 = 29

Finally, for n = 6:
S(6, 1) = S(5, 1) + S(5, 2) = 29 + 41 = 70
S(6, 2) = S(5, 1) + S(5, 2) + S(5, 3) = 29 + 41 + 29 = 99
S(6, 3) = S(5, 2) + S(5, 3) = 41 + 29 = 70

The total number of valid strings of length 6 is the sum of the counts for each ending digit:
Total = S(6, 1) + S(6, 2) + S(6, 3) = 70 + 99 + 70 = 239

Therefore, there are 239 strings of length 6 where each pair of adjacent digits differs by at most 1.</code></pre>
