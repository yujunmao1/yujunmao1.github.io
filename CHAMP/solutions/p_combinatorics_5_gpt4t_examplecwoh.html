<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} have no two successive numbers?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., 10} that do not contain any pair of successive numbers. We can approach this problem using a method similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

Let&#x27;s define a subset that ends with the number i as a subset where i is the largest number in the subset. We will count the number of such subsets for each i and then sum them up.

Let&#x27;s denote by S(i) the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., i} that do not contain successive numbers and that include the number i. We will also consider the empty set as a valid subset for our count.

For S(1), there is only 1 subset: {1}.
For S(2), we cannot include 1 because we cannot have successive numbers, so there is only 1 subset: {2}.

Now, for i &gt; 2, we have two options for forming a subset that ends with i and has no successive numbers:
1. We include i in our subset. If we do this, we cannot include i-1, but we can include any subset from {1, 2, ..., i-2} that does not have successive numbers.
2. We do not include i in our subset. In this case, we are simply looking for subsets of {1, 2, ..., i-1} that do not have successive numbers.

Therefore, the recurrence relation for S(i) is:
S(i) = S(i-2) + S(i-1) for i &gt; 2

This is because to form a subset ending in i, we can take any subset ending in i-2 and add i to it (S(i-2)), or we can take any subset that does not end in i-1 (S(i-1)).

Let&#x27;s calculate the values up to S(10):

S(1) = 1 (subset: {1})
S(2) = 1 (subset: {2})
S(3) = S(1) + S(2) = 1 + 1 = 2 (subsets: {1, 3}, {3})
S(4) = S(2) + S(3) = 1 + 2 = 3 (subsets: {2, 4}, {1, 3, 4}, {4})
S(5) = S(3) + S(4) = 2 + 3 = 5 (subsets: {1, 3, 5}, {3, 5}, {2, 4, 5}, {1, 4, 5}, {5})
...
We can continue this process, but we can also notice that this sequence is very similar to the Fibonacci sequence, except it is shifted by one position. In the Fibonacci sequence, F(1) = F(2) = 1, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n &gt; 2. Our sequence starts with S(1) = 1 and S(2) = 1, just like the Fibonacci sequence.

So, we can use the Fibonacci numbers to find S(10):

F(1) = 1
F(2) = 1
F(3) = 2
F(4) = 3
F(5) = 5
F(6) = 8
F(7) = 13
F(8) = 21
F(9) = 34
F(10) = 55

Thus, S(10) = F(10) = 55.

However, we are not done yet. We have only counted the subsets that include the number 10. We also need to count the subsets that do not include 10, which are the same as the subsets of {1, 2, ..., 9} that do not have successive numbers. This count is given by S(9), which is F(9) = 34.

Therefore, the total number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., 10} that do not have successive numbers is S(10) + S(9) = F(10) + F(9) = 55 + 34 = 89.</code></pre>
