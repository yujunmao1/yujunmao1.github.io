<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: transitivity of divisibility.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept of transitivity of divisibility is a fundamental property of integers. It states that if one integer divides another integer, and that second integer divides a third integer, then the first integer also divides the third integer.

More formally, let&#x27;s say we have three integers, a, b, and c. If a divides b, denoted as a | b, and b divides c, denoted as b | c, then it follows that a divides c, denoted as a | c.

In simpler terms, if we have a situation where a is a factor of b, and b is a factor of c, then a must also be a factor of c.

For example, let&#x27;s consider the integers 2, 4, and 8. We know that 2 divides 4 because 4 is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder (2 | 4). Similarly, we know that 4 divides 8 because 8 is divisible by 4 without leaving a remainder (4 | 8). Therefore, by the transitivity of divisibility, we can conclude that 2 divides 8 (2 | 8).

This property is important in various areas of mathematics, including number theory and algebra. It allows us to establish relationships between different numbers based on their divisibility, and it helps us solve problems involving factors and multiples.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The polynomial f(x) has integer coefficients and there exists an integer k such that f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2) are all divisible by 3. For integer m in {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, at least how many of them have f(m) divisible by 3, as an expression of k?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.
2. If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s start by considering the given information. We know that f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2) are all divisible by 3. This means that f(k) ≡ 0 (mod 3), f(k+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3), and f(k+2) ≡ 0 (mod 3).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(m) for m in {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}. We want to determine how many of these values of m will result in f(m) being divisible by 3.

Using the information given, we can apply the concept of transitivity of divisibility. Since f(k) ≡ 0 (mod 3) and f(k+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3), we can conclude that f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)^n - f(k+1)^n for any positive integer n.

Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2. Similarly, we have f(k+1) - f(k+2) | f(k+1)^2 - f(k+2)^2.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2. Using the second given information, we know that if d | a and d | b, then d | a + b and d | a - b. Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | (f(k) + f(k+1))(f(k) - f(k+1)).

Since f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2 and f(k) - f(k+1) | (f(k) + f(k+1))(f(k) - f(k+1)), we can conclude that f(k) - f(k+1) | (f(k) + f(k+1))(f(k) - f(k+1)) - (f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2).

Simplifying the expression, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)^2 + f(k)f(k+1) + f(k+1)f(k) + f(k+1)^2 - f(k)^2 + f(k+1)^2.

This simplifies further to f(k) - f(k+1) | 2f(k)f(k+1) + 2f(k+1)^2.

Since f(k) - f(k+1) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2f(k)f(k+1) + 2f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k+1)^2 - f(k+2)^2. Using the same reasoning as above, we can conclude that f(k+1) - f(k+2) | 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2.

Since f(k+1) - f(k+2) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)f(k+2) - f(k+1)^2. Using the first given information, we know that a - b | a^n - b^n. Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2.

Since f(k) - f(k+1) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that f(k)^2 - f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)f(k+2) - f(k+1)^2. Using the second given information, we know that if d | a and d | b, then d | ax + by. Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)f(k+2) - f(k+1)^2.

Since f(k) - f(k+1) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that f(k)f(k+2) - f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2. Using the second given information, we know that if d | a and d | b, then d | ax + by. Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2.

Since f(k) - f(k+1) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2. Using the second given information, we know that if d | a and d | b, then d | a - b. Applying this property, we have f(k) - f(k+1) | f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2.

Since f(k) - f(k+1) is divisible by 3, we can conclude that f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+2) - 2f(k+1)f(k+2) - 2f(k+2)^2. This simplifies to -2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2.

Since -2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that -2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the expression -2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 + 2f(k)f(k+1) + 2f(k+1)^2. This simplifies to 0.

Therefore, we have shown that f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+2) - 2f(k+1)f(k+2) - 2f(k+2)^2 is divisible by 3, which means that f(k)f(k+2) + 2f(k+1)f(k+2) + 2f(k+2)^2 - 2f(k)f(k+1) - 2f(k+1)^2 is also divisible by 3.

Therefore, for any value of k, f(m) is divisible by 3 for all m in {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}.

So, the answer to the problem is that all of the integers in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k} have f(m) divisible by 3.</code></pre>
