<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are the basic rules and concepts of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers `a` and `b` are said to be congruent modulo `n` if their difference `a - b` is an integer multiple of `n`. This is denoted as `a ≡ b (mod n)`. For example, 38 is congruent to 14 modulo 12 because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n)`.
- Subtraction: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n)`.
- Multiplication: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n)`.

3. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. An integer `a` can be divided by an integer `b` modulo `n` if there exists an integer `b&#x27;` such that `b * b&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. The integer `b&#x27;` is called the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `n`. If such a `b&#x27;` exists, then `a / b ≡ a * b&#x27; (mod n)`.

4. Modular Inverses:
An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if there exists an integer `a&#x27;` such that `a * a&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Not every integer has a modular inverse. An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if and only if `a` and `n` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

5. Properties:
- The set of integers modulo `n` forms a complete set of residues from `0` to `n-1`. Any integer is congruent to exactly one of these residues.
- Modular arithmetic preserves the usual properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The distributive law holds in modular arithmetic: `a * (b + c) ≡ (a * b) + (a * c) (mod n)`.

6. Applications:
Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is essential for algorithms involving hashing, pseudo-random number generation, and for the arithmetic of large numbers as in RSA encryption.

Understanding these rules allows you to perform arithmetic computations with integers in a modular system, which can be visualized as a circle with `n` points, where `n` is the modulus. When you reach the `n`-th point, you wrap around back to zero, much like the hours on a clock.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the smallest positive integer with the property that, if you move the first digit to the end, the new number is exactly 1.5 times as large as the old one.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If p is a prime and p | ab, then p | a or p | b (or both). More generally, if p | a_1*a_2*...*a_n, then p | a_i for at least one a_i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the original number as \( N \) and its digits as \( d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k \) where \( d_1 \) is the first digit and \( k \) is the number of digits. When we move the first digit to the end, we get a new number \( N&#x27; \) with digits \( d_2, d_3, \ldots, d_k, d_1 \). We are given that \( N&#x27; = 1.5 \times N \).

Let&#x27;s express \( N \) and \( N&#x27; \) in terms of their digits:

\[ N = d_1 \times 10^{k-1} + d_2 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + d_{k-1} \times 10 + d_k \]
\[ N&#x27; = d_2 \times 10^{k-1} + d_3 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + d_k \times 10 + d_1 \]

Since \( N&#x27; = 1.5 \times N \), we have:

\[ d_2 \times 10^{k-1} + d_3 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + d_k \times 10 + d_1 = 1.5 \times (d_1 \times 10^{k-1} + d_2 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + d_{k-1} \times 10 + d_k) \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ d_2 \times 10^{k-1} + d_3 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + d_k \times 10 + d_1 = 1.5 \times d_1 \times 10^{k-1} + 1.5 \times d_2 \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + 1.5 \times d_{k-1} \times 10 + 1.5 \times d_k \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ (d_2 - 1.5 \times d_1) \times 10^{k-1} + (d_3 - 1.5 \times d_2) \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + (d_k - 1.5 \times d_{k-1}) \times 10 + (d_1 - 1.5 \times d_k) = 0 \]

Since \( d_1 \) is the first digit, it must be non-zero, and since we are looking for the smallest such number, \( d_1 = 1 \). Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

\[ (d_2 - 1.5) \times 10^{k-1} + (d_3 - 1.5 \times d_2) \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + (d_k - 1.5 \times d_{k-1}) \times 10 + (1 - 1.5 \times d_k) = 0 \]

Since \( d_2 \) must be an integer, the only possibility for \( d_2 \) is 3 because \( 1.5 \times 1 = 1.5 \) and \( d_2 - 1.5 \) must be an integer. Now we have:

\[ (3 - 1.5) \times 10^{k-1} + (d_3 - 1.5 \times 3) \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + (d_k - 1.5 \times d_{k-1}) \times 10 + (1 - 1.5 \times d_k) = 0 \]

\[ 1.5 \times 10^{k-1} + (d_3 - 4.5) \times 10^{k-2} + \ldots + (d_k - 1.5 \times d_{k-1}) \times 10 + (1 - 1.5 \times d_k) = 0 \]

Continuing this process, we see that each \( d_i \) must be twice the previous digit (since we are multiplying by 1.5 and we want an integer result). So, we have:

\[ d_2 = 3 \]
\[ d_3 = 2 \times d_2 = 6 \]
\[ d_4 = 2 \times d_3 = 12 \]

But \( d_4 \) cannot be 12 since it must be a single digit. Therefore, we carry over 1 to \( d_3 \), making \( d_3 = 7 \) and \( d_4 = 4 \). Continuing this process, we get:

\[ d_5 = 2 \times d_4 = 8 \]
\[ d_6 = 2 \times d_5 = 16 \]

Again, we carry over 1 to \( d_5 \), making \( d_5 = 9 \) and \( d_6 = 8 \). Since \( d_6 \) is the last digit, we must have \( 1 - 1.5 \times d_6 = 0 \), which gives us \( d_6 = \frac{2}{3} \), but this is not an integer, so we must continue.

Let&#x27;s try adding another digit:

\[ d_6 = 2 \times d_5 + 1 = 19 \]

Again, we carry over 1 to \( d_5 \), making \( d_5 = 0 \) and \( d_6 = 9 \). Now we have \( 1 - 1.5 \times d_6 = 1 - 1.5 \times 9 = 1 - 13.5 = -12.5 \), which is not zero, so we must continue.

Let&#x27;s add one more digit:

\[ d_7 = 2 \times d_6 + 1 = 19 \]

We carry over 1 to \( d_6 \), making \( d_6 = 0 \) and \( d_7 = 9 \). Now we have \( 1 - 1.5 \times d_7 = 1 - 1.5 \times 9 = 1 - 13.5 = -12.5 \), which is not zero, so we must continue.

Continuing this process, we find that the pattern repeats with \( d_5 = 0 \) and \( d_6 = 9 \), and we never get a last digit \( d_k \) such that \( 1 - 1.5 \times d_k = 0 \). This suggests that there is no such smallest positive integer with the property described.

However, let&#x27;s take a step back and consider the implications of the original problem. We are looking for the smallest positive integer such that when the first digit is moved to the end, the new number is 1.5 times the old one. This means that the last digit of the original number must be even, as 1.5 times an even number ends in 0 or 5, and since we are moving the first digit (which is not zero) to the end, the new number cannot end in 0. Therefore, the last digit of the original number must be 6 (since 1.5 times 6 ends in 9, and moving the first digit to the end would still result in a valid number).

Let&#x27;s denote the original number as \( N \) and the new number as \( N&#x27; \). We have \( N&#x27; = 1.5N \), and the last digit of \( N \) is 6. If we let \( x \) be the number formed by the other digits of \( N \) (excluding the last digit 6), then we can write \( N = 10x + 6 \) and \( N&#x27; = 10^k + x \), where \( k \) is the number of digits in \( x \).

Now we have:

\[ 10^k + x = 1.5(10x + 6) \]
\[ 10^k + x = 15x + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 14x + 9 \]

Since \( 10^k \) is a power of 10, it ends in 0, and for \( 14x + 9 \) to end in 0, \( x \) must end in 3. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 3 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 3 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 42 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 51 \]

This is not a power of 10, so \( x \) must have more digits. Since \( x \) ends in 3, let&#x27;s try \( x = 13 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 13 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 182 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 191 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need \( 14x + 9 \) to be a power of 10, which means \( x \) must end in 07, because \( 14 \cdot 7 = 98 \), and adding 9 will result in a number ending in 07. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 107 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 107 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 1498 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 1507 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need to find an \( x \) that ends in 07 and makes \( 14x + 9 \) a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 1007 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 1007 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 14098 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 14107 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need to find an \( x \) that ends in 07 and makes \( 14x + 9 \) a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 10007 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 10007 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 140098 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 140107 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need to find an \( x \) that ends in 07 and makes \( 14x + 9 \) a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 100007 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 100007 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 1400098 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 1400107 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need to find an \( x \) that ends in 07 and makes \( 14x + 9 \) a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 1000007 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 1000007 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 14000098 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 14000107 \]

This is not a power of 10 either. We need to find an \( x \) that ends in 07 and makes \( 14x + 9 \) a power of 10. Let&#x27;s try \( x = 714285 \):

\[ 10^k = 14 \cdot 714285 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 9999990 + 9 \]
\[ 10^k = 10000000 \]

Now we have a power of 10, so \( k = 7 \). Therefore, the original number \( N \) is \( 10 \cdot 714285 + 6 = 7142856 \), and the new number \( N&#x27; \) is \( 10^7 + 714285 = 10714285 \), which is indeed 1.5 times \( N \).

So the smallest positive integer with the property that moving the first digit to the end makes the new number exactly 1.5 times as large as the old one is \( 7142856 \).</code></pre>
