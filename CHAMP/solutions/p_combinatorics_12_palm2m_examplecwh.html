<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.

Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

I hope this helps!</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be the sequence of parking preferences of the drivers. We will show that there are $\binom{n+1}{n}$ sequences that satisfy the condition that every driver can park.

To see this, we can first convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an $(n+1)$-th lot that connects to both the $n$-th lot and the 1st lot. Now, consider all driver preference sequences of length $n+1$ but taking values in 1 to $n+1$. For each such sequence, we can construct a corresponding parking configuration on the circular lot as follows:

1. Start by parking the car with preference 1 in the first lot.
2. For each subsequent car, park it in the first empty lot that is clockwise from the lot where the previous car was parked.

It is easy to see that this construction always results in a valid parking configuration, since every car parks in its preferred lot. Conversely, given any valid parking configuration on the circular lot, we can easily reconstruct the corresponding driver preference sequence. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between valid parking configurations on the circular lot and driver preference sequences of length $n+1$.

Now, there are $\binom{n+1}{n}$ ways to choose which $n$ of the $n+1$ lots will be occupied by cars. Therefore, there are $\binom{n+1}{n}$ sequences that satisfy the condition that every driver can park.

**Remark:** The same argument can be used to show that there are $\binom{n+1}{k}$ sequences that satisfy the condition that the first $k$ drivers can park.</code></pre>
