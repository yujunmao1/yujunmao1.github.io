<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If ab | c, then a | c and b | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The statement &quot;If ab | c, then a | c and b | c&quot; is not generally true. The correct statement should be &quot;If ab | c, then a | c or b | c is not necessarily true, but if a and b are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), then a | c and b | c.&quot;

Let&#x27;s give an example where a and b are coprime:

Let a = 3, b = 4, and c = 12.

Since 3 and 4 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), we can check if both 3 and 4 divide 12.

Indeed, 3 | 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4, which is an integer.
And 4 | 12 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3, which is also an integer.

Since both a and b divide c, and ab (which is 3 × 4 = 12) also divides c, the statement holds true in this case.

However, if a and b are not coprime, it is not necessarily true that both a and b divide c. For example:

Let a = 6, b = 4, and c = 24.

Here, ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and indeed ab | c because 24 ÷ 24 = 1, which is an integer.

However, while it is true that 6 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 6 = 4) and 4 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 4 = 6), this does not always hold for non-coprime a and b. If we change c to 48, then:

ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and ab | 48 because 48 ÷ 24 = 2, which is an integer.

But if we take a = 6 and b = 4, they are not coprime (they share a common divisor of 2), and while it is still true that 6 | 48 and 4 | 48, if we had a different c where the common divisor of a and b does not divide c, the statement would not hold. For example, if c were 36, then ab = 24 does not divide 36, and while 6 divides 36, 4 does not.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If p is a prime and p | ab, then p | a or p | b (or both). More generally, if p | a_1*a_2*...*a_n, then p | a_i for at least one a_i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is known as Euclid&#x27;s lemma, which is a fundamental result in number theory. It states that if a prime number divides the product of two integers, it must divide at least one of those integers. More generally, if a prime number divides a product of several integers, it must divide at least one of those integers.

Let&#x27;s illustrate this with an example:

Let p = 5 (which is a prime number), and consider the product of two integers a = 6 and b = 10.

We have ab = 6 * 10 = 60.

Now, 5 | 60 because 60 ÷ 5 = 12, which is an integer.

According to Euclid&#x27;s lemma, since 5 is prime and it divides the product ab, it must divide at least one of a or b.

Checking a = 6, we see that 5 does not divide 6, since 6 ÷ 5 is not an integer.

Checking b = 10, we find that 5 does divide 10, since 10 ÷ 5 = 2, which is an integer.

So in this case, p (which is 5) divides b (which is 10), confirming Euclid&#x27;s lemma.

For the more general case, let&#x27;s consider p = 3 (a prime number) and the product of several integers a_1 = 4, a_2 = 5, a_3 = 6.

We have a_1 * a_2 * a_3 = 4 * 5 * 6 = 120.

Now, 3 | 120 because 120 ÷ 3 = 40, which is an integer.

According to the general statement of Euclid&#x27;s lemma, since 3 divides the product a_1 * a_2 * a_3, it must divide at least one of the a_i.

Checking a_1 = 4, we see that 3 does not divide 4.
Checking a_2 = 5, we see that 3 does not divide 5.
Checking a_3 = 6, we find that 3 does divide 6, since 6 ÷ 3 = 2, which is an integer.

So in this case, p (which is 3) divides a_3 (which is 6), again confirming the general statement of Euclid&#x27;s lemma.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is related to the property of coprime integers and their divisors. If two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, meaning their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1, and if \( a \) divides the product \( bc \), then \( a \) must divide \( c \).

Let&#x27;s illustrate this with an example:

Let \( a = 7 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 3 \).

First, we check that \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime:
\( \text{gcd}(7, 5) = 1 \), since 7 and 5 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the product \( bc \):
\( bc = 5 \times 3 = 15 \).

We want to know if \( a \) divides \( bc \). In this case, \( a = 7 \) does not divide \( 15 \), so the condition \( a | bc \) is not satisfied, and we cannot conclude anything about \( a | c \) from this.

To apply the concept correctly, we need to ensure that \( a | bc \). Let&#x27;s modify \( c \) to make this true. Let&#x27;s take \( c = 14 \) instead.

Now, we have:
\( bc = 5 \times 14 = 70 \).

We can see that \( a = 7 \) divides \( bc = 70 \) because \( 70 \div 7 = 10 \), which is an integer.

Since \( a \) divides \( bc \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \), according to the concept, \( a \) must also divide \( c \). Indeed, \( a = 7 \) divides \( c = 14 \) because \( 14 \div 7 = 2 \), which is an integer.

Therefore, the example satisfies the concept: \( a | bc \) and \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 1 \) implies \( a | c \).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let the original number has k+1 digits, with the first digit d, and the last k digits representing the number r.
2. Set up the equation of digit manipulation involving k, d, r.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the original number as \( N \), which has \( k+1 \) digits. The first digit is \( d \), and the remaining \( k \) digits represent the number \( r \). When the first digit is removed, we are left with the number \( r \).

The original number \( N \) can be expressed in terms of \( d \), \( r \), and \( k \) as follows:
\[ N = d \times 10^k + r \]

According to the problem, when the first digit is removed, the number becomes 57 times smaller. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ r = \frac{N}{57} \]

Substituting the expression for \( N \) into the equation, we get:
\[ r = \frac{d \times 10^k + r}{57} \]

Multiplying both sides by 57 to clear the fraction, we have:
\[ 57r = d \times 10^k + r \]

Now, let&#x27;s isolate \( r \) on one side:
\[ 57r - r = d \times 10^k \]
\[ 56r = d \times 10^k \]

Since \( r \) is the number formed by the last \( k \) digits of \( N \), and \( d \) is a single digit, \( r \) must be divisible by 56 for the equation to hold true. Moreover, \( d \times 10^k \) must be a multiple of 56, and \( d \) must be such that \( d \times 10^k \) is just one digit followed by \( k \) zeros.

The smallest digit \( d \) that is not zero is 1, so let&#x27;s start by testing \( d = 1 \):
\[ 56r = 1 \times 10^k \]

For the smallest positive integer, we want the smallest \( k \) such that \( 10^k \) is divisible by 56. Since 56 is divisible by 7 and 8, \( 10^k \) must be at least 1000 to be divisible by 8 (because 100 is not divisible by 8). Therefore, \( k \) must be at least 3.

Let&#x27;s test \( k = 3 \):
\[ 56r = 10^3 \]
\[ r = \frac{10^3}{56} \]
\[ r = \frac{1000}{56} \]
\[ r = 17 \text{ with a remainder (since 56 * 18 = 1008)} \]

Since 1000 is not exactly divisible by 56, we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( 10^k \) is exactly divisible by 56. We can do this by increasing \( k \) until we find a suitable value.

Let&#x27;s try \( k = 4 \):
\[ 56r = 10^4 \]
\[ r = \frac{10^4}{56} \]
\[ r = \frac{10000}{56} \]
\[ r = 178 \text{ with a remainder (since 56 * 179 = 10064)} \]

Again, we have a remainder. Let&#x27;s try \( k = 5 \):
\[ 56r = 10^5 \]
\[ r = \frac{10^5}{56} \]
\[ r = \frac{100000}{56} \]
\[ r = 1785 \text{ with a remainder (since 56 * 1786 = 100016)} \]

We still have a remainder. Let&#x27;s try \( k = 6 \):
\[ 56r = 10^6 \]
\[ r = \frac{10^6}{56} \]
\[ r = \frac{1000000}{56} \]
\[ r = 17857 \text{ with no remainder (since 56 * 17857 = 1000000)} \]

Now we have found an \( r \) that is an integer with no remainder. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( N \) that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed is:
\[ N = d \times 10^k + r \]
\[ N = 1 \times 10^6 + 17857 \]
\[ N = 1000000 + 17857 \]
\[ N = 1017857 \]

So, the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition is \( 1017857 \).</code></pre>
