<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
In other words, you can add the remainders of two numbers and the sum will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
Similar to addition, you can subtract the remainders of two numbers and the difference will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
When you multiply two numbers, you can multiply their remainders to get the remainder of the product when divided by the modulus.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You cannot simply divide the remainders unless the number you are dividing by is coprime with the modulus (they share no common divisors other than 1). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), and c has a multiplicative inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / d) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
You can raise both sides of a congruence to a power, and the result will be congruent modulo n.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have modular inverses; an integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory, as well as in practical applications such as calculating the day of the week for a given date. It simplifies arithmetic for large numbers by dealing with their remainders and has properties that are useful in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we are looking for the smallest positive value of the absolute difference between 12^m and 5^n, where m and n are positive integers. We are looking for |12^m - 5^n|.

Let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of 12, which is 2^2 * 3. Since 5 is a prime number and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 5 and 12 is 1, it follows from the given information that 5^n will not have any factors of 2 or 3 for any positive integer n. This means that 5^n will always be 1 more or 1 less than a multiple of 12 for it to be close to a power of 12.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the powers of 5 modulo 12 to see if we can find a power of 5 that is congruent to 1 or -1 modulo 12, which would mean it is 1 more or 1 less than a multiple of 12.

5^1 ≡ 5 (mod 12)
5^2 ≡ 25 ≡ 1 (mod 12)

We find that 5^2 is congruent to 1 modulo 12. This means that 5^2 is one more than a multiple of 12. Therefore, 5^(2n) will also be congruent to 1 modulo 12 for any positive integer n, because (5^2)^n = 5^(2n) and we can use the property of powers in modular arithmetic.

Now, we want to find the smallest m such that 12^m is close to 5^(2n). Since 5^2 is just over a multiple of 12, we want to find the smallest power of 12 that is just over a multiple of 5^2. The first power of 12 that is greater than 1 is 12^1 itself, but 12 is not just over a power of 5^2.

However, 12^2 = 144, and 5^2 = 25. The difference between 144 and 25 is 119, which is not minimal since we are looking for the smallest absolute difference.

Let&#x27;s try squaring 5^2 to get 5^4 and see if that brings us closer to a power of 12:

5^4 = 625

Now, let&#x27;s find the closest power of 12 to 625. Since 12^2 = 144, let&#x27;s try 12^3:

12^3 = 1728

The difference between 1728 and 625 is 1103, which is still not minimal.

However, if we consider 12^1, we have:

12^1 = 12

And we already know that 5^2 = 25. The difference between 25 and 12 is:

|25 - 12| = 13

This is a smaller difference than 119, and since we are looking for the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|, we need to check if there&#x27;s an even smaller difference for some other powers of 5 and 12.

Let&#x27;s try the next power of 5, which is 5^3:

5^3 = 125

Now, we want to find the closest power of 12 to 125. We already know that 12^2 = 144, which is close to 125. The difference is:

|144 - 125| = 19

This is larger than 13, so the smallest difference we&#x27;ve found so far is still 13.

Since we are looking for the smallest positive value of |12^m - 5^n| and we&#x27;ve found that |25 - 12| = 13 is the smallest difference with m = 1 and n = 2, we can conclude that the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is 13.</code></pre>
