<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 12 geometric progressions be selected from the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 such that every number is in exactly one progression?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. For three different prime numbers, p&lt;q&lt;r, we have r/q≠q/p, because otherwise q^2=pr implies that p=q=r.
2. So no three prime numbers can be in one geometric progression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider how we can form geometric progressions (GPs) from the numbers 1 to 100 such that each number is included in exactly one GP.

A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a constant called the common ratio. For example, in the GP 2, 4, 8, ..., the common ratio is 2.

Given the constraint that no three prime numbers can be in one geometric progression, we must consider how to distribute the prime numbers among the GPs. Since there are 25 prime numbers between 1 and 100 (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97), each of these must be the first term of its own GP, as no other terms can be prime. This immediately gives us 25 GPs.

Now, we need to consider the non-prime numbers. Each non-prime number must be part of a GP that starts with a prime number. Since we have 25 prime numbers, and each of these starts a GP, we need to distribute the remaining 75 non-prime numbers among these GPs.

The non-prime numbers can be powers of primes or products of different primes. For a non-prime number to be in a GP with a prime start, it must be a power of that prime. For example, the number 8 can be in the GP starting with 2 (2, 4, 8, ...), and the number 27 can be in the GP starting with 3 (3, 9, 27, ...).

Let&#x27;s consider the powers of 2 first. The powers of 2 up to 100 are 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. We&#x27;ve already counted 2, so we have 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 to distribute. These all go into the GP starting with 2. We do the same for the other primes.

For each prime p, we can only include powers of p in the GP starting with p. The highest power of p less than or equal to 100 is given by p^k ≤ 100, solving for k. For example, for p = 3, we have 3^1, 3^2, 3^3, 3^4 (3, 9, 27, 81) all included in the GP starting with 3.

After distributing all powers of primes to their respective GPs, we need to consider the products of different primes. These numbers cannot be included in any of the GPs we have formed so far because they would require a non-prime common ratio.

For example, the number 6 is the product of the primes 2 and 3. It cannot be in the GP starting with 2 because the next term (by multiplying by 3) would be 18, which is not a power of 2. Similarly, it cannot be in the GP starting with 3 because the next term (by multiplying by 2) would be 12, which is not a power of 3.

Therefore, each product of different primes must start its own GP. However, we are limited to a total of 12 GPs, and we have already used 25 GPs for the prime numbers.

At this point, we can see that the problem as stated is impossible to solve under the given constraints. We cannot form only 12 GPs with the numbers 1 to 100 such that each number is in exactly one GP, given that no three prime numbers can be in one GP and that each GP must start with a prime number.

The partial solution provided is correct in stating that no three prime numbers can be in one GP, but the problem does not seem to have a solution under the constraints given. If the problem has been stated incorrectly or if there are additional constraints or rules that have not been mentioned, please provide them so that we can attempt to solve the problem again.</code></pre>
