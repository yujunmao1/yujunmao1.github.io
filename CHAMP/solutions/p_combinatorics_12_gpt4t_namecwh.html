<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of derangements, also known as the &quot;hat-check problem.&quot; A derangement is a permutation of a set where none of the elements appear in their original position.

Let&#x27;s follow the steps outlined in the problem:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By converting the linear parking lot into a circular one, we are essentially looking for a circular permutation where no car parks in its favorite spot (since if it did, the car would block the sequence for any car whose favorite spot is further down the line).

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

The condition is that no car parks in its favorite spot, as mentioned above. This is because if a car parks in its favorite spot, it could potentially block another car from parking.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

Since we are considering a circular arrangement, each sequence of preferences can be rotated to create n different sequences. However, only one of these rotations will correspond to a valid linear parking arrangement where no car is in its favorite spot.

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Since there are (n+1) lots and n cars, there will always be one empty lot. For a given sequence, we can think of the empty lot as a &quot;dummy&quot; car that takes the place of one of the cars. This dummy car can be in any of the (n+1) positions, and the remaining n cars will be arranged in a derangement around it.

The number of derangements of n objects is given by the subfactorial function, denoted as !n or D(n). The formula for the number of derangements is:

\[ !n = n! \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \]

Since there are (n+1) possible positions for the dummy car, we multiply the number of derangements by (n+1) to get the total number of valid sequences:

\[ \text{Total valid sequences} = (n+1) \cdot !n \]

This is the expression for the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park, as an expression of n.</code></pre>
