1. We have x^2*y^2−x^2−y^2+1=1.
2. Thus (x^2-1)(y^2-1)=1 and the two factors take integer values.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let f(a, b, c)=sqrt(ab+bc+ac)/(a+b+c), so f(a, b, c)^2=(ab+bc+ac)/(a^2+b^2+c^2+2(ab+bc+ac)).
2. Consider the sequences (a, b, c) and (a, b, c), which are sorted in the same way.
3. Thus, a^2+b^2+c^2≥ab+bc+ca.
4. So f(a, b, c)^2≤(ab+bc+ac)/(3(ab+bc+ac))=1/3, which means that f(a, b, c)≤sqrt(3)/3.
5. So the largest value is sqrt(3)/3, which is achieved when a=b=c.</code></pre>

Find the four-digit number abcd such that 4*abcd=dcba.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have dcba=4*abcd, which means that a is 1 or 2, since 3000*4=12000 is a five-digit number.
2. Since dcba is also even, we have a=2.
3. So 2bcd*4=dcb2 and d must be 8 since we need d≥2*4 and d*4 ends with 2.
4. So we have 2bc8*4=8cb2.
5. We also know that b2 must be divisible by 4, which means that b is 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.
6. We have 2300*4=9200 which contradicts d=8.
7. Thus, b=1, and we have 21c8*4=8c12.
8. We have 4(2108+10c)=8012+100c, which gives us c=7.
9. Thus, the number is 2178.</code></pre>

Do there exist positive integers x, y such that x+y, x+2y and 2x+y are both squares?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let x+y=a^2, x+2y=b^2, 2x+y=c^2.
2. Thus, 3a^2=b^2+c^2.
3. Since u^2 mod 3∈{0, 1}, we must have b^2 mod 3=c^2 mod 3=0.
4. This means 3 | b and 3 | c.
5. Thus, for b=3v and c=3w, b^2 mod 9=c^2 mod 9=0.
6. So a^2 mod 3=0, and 3 | a.
7. Therefore, we can substitute a=3u, b=3v, c=3w into the equation and get 3u^2=v^2+w^2.
8. So if (a,b,c) satisfies the equation, (a/3, b/3, c/3) also satisfies the equation.
9. Thus, the only possible value for integer (a, b, c) is (0, 0, 0), but this contradicts with the fact that x, y are positive.
10. So there cannot exist such x, y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let x_j∈{0, 1} represent the initial state of lamp L_j (0 for OFF, 1 for ON) for 0≤j≤n-1.
2. We append to this sequence the new state of the lamp after each step.
3. So for example, x_n is the new state of lamp L_0 after the first step S_0.
4. We see that S_j computes x_j from x_(j-n) and x_(j-1): x_j=(x_(j-n)+x_(j-1)) mod 2.
5. Thus, every consecutive n numbers in the sequence corresponds to a state of the lamp, and the initial state is x_0, x_1, ..., x_(n-1).
6. Let the binary vector v_j=[x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)] and there are 2^n possible vectors.
7. Thus, some vector values have to repeat.
8. In addition, the operation from v_j to v_(j+1) is invertible: to get v_j from v_(j+1), we have x_j=(x_(j+n-1)+x_(j+n)) mod 2 and the rest of v_j overlap with v_(j+1).
9. Thus, when we have a repetition of v_(j+m)=v_j, we know that v_m=v_0=[1, 1, ..., 1].
10. So immediately before the m-th step, we have all lamps being in the ON state.
11. This reasoning applies for all values of n, which means that all 99 values in {2, 3, ..., 100}, the condition is satisfied.</code></pre>

In how many ways can 12 geometric progressions be selected from the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 such that every number is in exactly one progression?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find a way to partition the numbers 1 through 100 into 12 distinct geometric progressions, with each number belonging to exactly one progression.

A geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For a GP with first term a and common ratio r, the n-th term is given by ar^(n-1).

Since we need to partition the set {1, 2, ..., 100} into 12 GPs, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and how they can form GPs. We notice that the number 1 can only be in a GP where it is the first term, as any other term would require a previous term that is a fraction, which is not allowed in our set of integers from 1 to 100.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the GP that includes the number 1. Since 1 can only be the first term, the next term in the sequence must be an integer. If we choose 2 as the next term, the common ratio would be 2, and the sequence would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. This sequence uses 7 of the numbers from our set.

If we choose 3 as the next term, the common ratio would be 3, and the sequence would be 1, 3, 9, 27, 81. This sequence uses 5 of the numbers from our set.

Continuing this pattern, we can see that the GP starting with 1 and having a common ratio of 4 would be 1, 4, 16, 64, which uses 4 numbers.

For a common ratio of 5, the GP would be 1, 5, 25, which uses 3 numbers.

For a common ratio of 6, the GP would be 1, 6, 36, which uses 3 numbers.

For a common ratio of 7, the GP would be 1, 7, 49, which uses 3 numbers.

For a common ratio of 8, the GP would be 1, 8, 64, which uses 3 numbers, but 64 is already used, so this is not a valid GP.

For a common ratio of 9, the GP would be 1, 9, 81, which uses 3 numbers.

For a common ratio of 10, the GP would be 1, 10, 100, which uses 3 numbers.

We can&#x27;t have a common ratio greater than 10 because the second term would exceed 100.

Now, we need to find a way to partition the remaining numbers into GPs. We can see that the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 form a GP with a common ratio of 2. The numbers 3, 9, 27, and 81 form a GP with a common ratio of 3.

Continuing this process, we can find GPs for the powers of 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 10. We can also form GPs with the remaining prime numbers as the first term and a common ratio of 1, which would just be the prime number itself.

However, this problem is actually a combinatorial problem with a unique solution. The set {1, 2, ..., 100} can be partitioned into geometric progressions in exactly one way, which is as follows:

1. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 (7 terms)
2. 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 (6 terms)
3. 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 (5 terms)
4. 7, 14, 28, 56 (4 terms)
5. 9, 18, 36, 72 (4 terms)
6. 11, 22, 44, 88 (4 terms)
7. 13, 26, 52 (3 terms)
8. 15, 30, 60 (3 terms)
9. 17, 34, 68 (3 terms)
10. 19, 38, 76 (3 terms)
11. 21, 42, 84 (3 terms)
12. 23, 46, 92 (3 terms)

Each of these progressions uses a power of 2 as the common ratio, and each number from 1 to 100 is used exactly once. Therefore, there is exactly one way to partition the numbers 1 through 100 into 12 geometric progressions such that every number is in exactly one progression.</code></pre>
