<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: If f(x)=x^5-x+a is divisible by x-b for some integer b, what are possible values of a mod 5?
Step-wise solution:
1. We can write f(x)=x^5-x+a=(x-b)q(x).
2. Thus, f(b)=b^5-b+a=0, or b^5-b=-a.
3. Since 5 is a prime number, we have 5 | b^5-b, which means that a mod 5=0.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the remainder of x^100-2x^51+1 divided by x^2-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the remainder of the polynomial x^100 - 2x^51 + 1 divided by x^2 - 1, we can use polynomial long division. 

First, let&#x27;s write the polynomial in descending order of powers of x:

x^100 - 2x^51 + 1

Now, let&#x27;s divide the leading term of the dividend (x^100) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2) to get the first term of the quotient:

x^100 / x^2 = x^98

Next, we multiply the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the quotient (x^98) and subtract it from the dividend:

(x^98)(x^2 - 1) = x^100 - x^98

(x^100 - 2x^51 + 1) - (x^100 - x^98) = -x^98 - 2x^51 + 1

Now, we repeat the process with the new dividend (-x^98 - 2x^51 + 1):

- x^98 - 2x^51 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-x^98) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

- x^98 / x^2 = -x^96

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-x^96) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-x^96)(x^2 - 1) = -x^98 + x^96

(-x^98 - 2x^51 + 1) - (-x^98 + x^96) = -2x^51 + x^96 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

Continuing the division, we have:

-2x^51 + x^96 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^51) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^51 / x^2 = -2x^49

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^49) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^49)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^51 + 2x^49

(-2x^51 + x^96 + 1) - (-2x^51 + 2x^49) = x^96 - 2x^49 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^96 - 2x^49 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^96) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^96 / x^2 = x^94

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^94) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^94)(x^2 - 1) = x^96 - x^94

(x^96 - 2x^49 + 1) - (x^96 - x^94) = -2x^49 + x^94 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^49 + x^94 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^49) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^49 / x^2 = -2x^47

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^47) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^47)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^49 + 2x^47

(-2x^49 + x^94 + 1) - (-2x^49 + 2x^47) = x^94 - 2x^47 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^94 - 2x^47 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^94) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^94 / x^2 = x^92

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^92) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^92)(x^2 - 1) = x^94 - x^92

(x^94 - 2x^47 + 1) - (x^94 - x^92) = -2x^47 + x^92 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^47 + x^92 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^47) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^47 / x^2 = -2x^45

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^45) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^45)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^47 + 2x^45

(-2x^47 + x^92 + 1) - (-2x^47 + 2x^45) = x^92 - 2x^45 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^92 - 2x^45 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^92) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^92 / x^2 = x^90

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^90) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^90)(x^2 - 1) = x^92 - x^90

(x^92 - 2x^45 + 1) - (x^92 - x^90) = -2x^45 + x^90 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^45 + x^90 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^45) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^45 / x^2 = -2x^43

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^43) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^43)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^45 + 2x^43

(-2x^45 + x^90 + 1) - (-2x^45 + 2x^43) = x^90 - 2x^43 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^90 - 2x^43 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^90) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^90 / x^2 = x^88

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^88) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^88)(x^2 - 1) = x^90 - x^88

(x^90 - 2x^43 + 1) - (x^90 - x^88) = -2x^43 + x^88 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^43 + x^88 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^43) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^43 / x^2 = -2x^41

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^41) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^41)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^43 + 2x^41

(-2x^43 + x^88 + 1) - (-2x^43 + 2x^41) = x^88 - 2x^41 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^88 - 2x^41 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^88) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^88 / x^2 = x^86

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^86) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^86)(x^2 - 1) = x^88 - x^86

(x^88 - 2x^41 + 1) - (x^88 - x^86) = -2x^41 + x^86 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^41 + x^86 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^41) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^41 / x^2 = -2x^39

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^39) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^39)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^41 + 2x^39

(-2x^41 + x^86 + 1) - (-2x^41 + 2x^39) = x^86 - 2x^39 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^86 - 2x^39 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^86) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^86 / x^2 = x^84

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^84) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^84)(x^2 - 1) = x^86 - x^84

(x^86 - 2x^39 + 1) - (x^86 - x^84) = -2x^39 + x^84 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^39 + x^84 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (-2x^39) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

-2x^39 / x^2 = -2x^37

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (-2x^37) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(-2x^37)(x^2 - 1) = -2x^39 + 2x^37

(-2x^39 + x^84 + 1) - (-2x^39 + 2x^37) = x^84 - 2x^37 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

x^84 - 2x^37 + 1

Dividing the leading term of the new dividend (x^84) by the leading term of the divisor (x^2), we get:

x^84 / x^2 = x^82

Multiplying the divisor (x^2 - 1) by the first term of the new quotient (x^82) and subtracting it from the new dividend, we get:

(x^82)(x^2 - 1) = x^84 - x^82

(x^84 - 2x^37 + 1) - (x^84 - x^82) = -2x^37 + x^82 + 1

We continue this process until the degree of the new dividend is less than the degree of the divisor.

-2x^37 + x^82 + 1
