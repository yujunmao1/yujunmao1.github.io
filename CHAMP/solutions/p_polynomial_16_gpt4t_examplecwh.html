<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a property of integers that states if \( a \) and \( b \) are integers and \( n \) is a positive integer, then \( a - b \) divides \( a^n - b^n \). This is a consequence of the factorization of \( a^n - b^n \) using the difference of nth powers.

The factorization of \( a^n - b^n \) for \( n \) being a positive integer is given by:

\[ a^n - b^n = (a - b)(a^{n-1} + a^{n-2}b + a^{n-3}b^2 + \ldots + ab^{n-2} + b^{n-1}) \]

This shows that \( a - b \) is a factor of \( a^n - b^n \), and therefore \( a - b \) divides \( a^n - b^n \).

Let&#x27;s take a specific example with \( a = 5 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( n = 3 \):

We want to show that \( a - b \) divides \( a^n - b^n \), so we calculate:

\( a - b = 5 - 2 = 3 \)

\( a^n - b^n = 5^3 - 2^3 = 125 - 8 = 117 \)

Now we check if \( 3 \) divides \( 117 \):

\( 117 \div 3 = 39 \)

Since \( 117 \) is divisible by \( 3 \) without a remainder, we have shown that \( a - b \) divides \( a^n - b^n \) for this particular example.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is known as the transitivity of divisibility in number theory. It states that if an integer \( a \) divides an integer \( b \), and \( b \) divides an integer \( c \), then \( a \) also divides \( c \). In mathematical notation, this is expressed as:

If \( a | b \) and \( b | c \), then \( a | c \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate this concept:

Let&#x27;s take \( a = 4 \), \( b = 12 \), and \( c = 36 \).

First, we show that \( a | b \):
Since \( 12 \) is divisible by \( 4 \), we can write \( b = ka \) for some integer \( k \). In this case, \( k = 3 \) because \( 12 = 4 \times 3 \).

Next, we show that \( b | c \):
Since \( 36 \) is divisible by \( 12 \), we can write \( c = lb \) for some integer \( l \). In this case, \( l = 3 \) because \( 36 = 12 \times 3 \).

Now, we use these two facts to show that \( a | c \):
We have \( c = lb = l(ka) = (lk)a \). Substituting the values of \( k \) and \( l \), we get \( c = 3 \times 3 \times 4 = 36 \), which means \( c \) is divisible by \( a \).

Therefore, \( a = 4 \) divides \( c = 36 \), which confirms the transitivity of divisibility for this example.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a fundamental property of divisibility in number theory. It states that if an integer \( d \) divides two integers \( a \) and \( b \), then \( d \) also divides any linear combination of \( a \) and \( b \), such as \( ax + by \) for any integers \( x \) and \( y \). Additionally, \( d \) will divide the sum \( a + b \) and the difference \( a - b \).

Let&#x27;s take an example with \( d = 6 \), \( a = 18 \), and \( b = 24 \).

First, we show that \( d | a \) and \( d | b \):
- \( 18 \) is divisible by \( 6 \) because \( 18 = 6 \times 3 \).
- \( 24 \) is divisible by \( 6 \) because \( 24 = 6 \times 4 \).

Now, let&#x27;s show that \( d | ax + by \) for some integers \( x \) and \( y \). Let&#x27;s choose \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \):

\( ax + by = 18 \times 2 + 24 \times 3 = 36 + 72 = 108 \)

Since \( 108 \) is divisible by \( 6 \) (because \( 108 = 6 \times 18 \)), we have shown that \( d | ax + by \).

Next, we show that \( d | a + b \):

\( a + b = 18 + 24 = 42 \)

Since \( 42 \) is divisible by \( 6 \) (because \( 42 = 6 \times 7 \)), we have shown that \( d | a + b \).

Finally, we show that \( d | a - b \):

\( a - b = 18 - 24 = -6 \)

Since \( -6 \) is divisible by \( 6 \) (because \( -6 = 6 \times (-1) \)), we have shown that \( d | a - b \).

In summary, for \( d = 6 \), \( a = 18 \), and \( b = 24 \), we have demonstrated that \( d \) divides the linear combination \( ax + by \) for \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \), the sum \( a + b \), and the difference \( a - b \). This example confirms the stated divisibility property.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The polynomial f(x) has integer coefficients and there exists an integer k such that f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2) are all divisible by 3. For integer m in {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, at least how many of them have f(m) divisible by 3, as an expression of k?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. m-k, m-k-1 and m-k-2 are three consecutive numbers and must have a multiple of 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given that \( f(k) \), \( f(k+1) \), and \( f(k+2) \) are all divisible by 3, we can use the fact that for any polynomial \( f(x) \) with integer coefficients, the function \( f(x) - f(x-1) \) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients, and its degree is one less than the degree of \( f(x) \).

Let&#x27;s define a new polynomial \( g(x) = f(x) - f(x-1) \). Since \( f(k) \), \( f(k+1) \), and \( f(k+2) \) are divisible by 3, it follows that \( g(k+1) = f(k+1) - f(k) \) and \( g(k+2) = f(k+2) - f(k+1) \) are also divisible by 3.

Now, consider the polynomial \( h(x) = g(x) - g(x-1) \). This polynomial \( h(x) \) has integer coefficients and is of one degree less than \( g(x) \). Since \( g(k+1) \) and \( g(k+2) \) are divisible by 3, it follows that \( h(k+2) = g(k+2) - g(k+1) \) is also divisible by 3.

The polynomial \( h(x) \) represents the second finite difference of \( f(x) \), and since \( h(k+2) \) is divisible by 3, we know that \( h(x) \) is divisible by 3 for all integers \( x \). This is because the second finite difference of a polynomial with integer coefficients is a constant when the polynomial is of degree 2, and if it is of higher degree, the second finite difference will be a polynomial of degree \( n-2 \) which will still yield multiples of 3 for consecutive integer inputs given that it does so for three consecutive integers.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the integers \( m \) in the set \( \{k+3, k+4, \ldots, 2k\} \). For each \( m \) in this set, \( m-k \), \( m-k-1 \), and \( m-k-2 \) are three consecutive integers. By the property of \( h(x) \) being divisible by 3 for all integers \( x \), we know that \( g(m-k) \) is divisible by 3 for all \( m \) in the set.

Since \( g(x) = f(x) - f(x-1) \), and \( g(m-k) \) is divisible by 3, it follows that \( f(m-k) \) and \( f(m-k-1) \) leave the same remainder when divided by 3. Therefore, for every three consecutive integers \( m \), at least one of \( f(m) \) must be divisible by 3.

The number of integers in the set \( \{k+3, k+4, \ldots, 2k\} \) is \( 2k - (k+3) + 1 = k - 2 \). Since every three consecutive integers include at least one integer \( m \) for which \( f(m) \) is divisible by 3, we can divide \( k - 2 \) by 3 to find the minimum number of such \( m \).

The minimum number of integers \( m \) for which \( f(m) \) is divisible by 3 is \( \left\lceil \frac{k - 2}{3} \right\rceil \), where \( \lceil \cdot \rceil \) denotes the ceiling function, which rounds up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, for integer \( m \) in the set \( \{k+3, k+4, \ldots, 2k\} \), at least \( \left\lceil \frac{k - 2}{3} \right\rceil \) of them have \( f(m) \) divisible by 3.</code></pre>
