The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example. 

Suppose you have a deck of 52 playing cards and you want to draw a hand of 5 cards. The order in which you draw the cards doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e., drawing a King first and then a Queen is the same as drawing a Queen first and then a King). 

The number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from (52 cards in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (5 cards in this case). 

So, the number of different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck is C(52, 5). 

Using the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, we find that C(52, 5) = 52! / [5!(52-5)!] = 2,598,960. 

So, there are 2,598,960 different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. 

Suppose you are planning your weekend activities. You have three options: going to the cinema, going to a restaurant, or going to a park. 

1. There are 3 different movies playing at the cinema that you are interested in, so there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.
2. There are 2 restaurants you like, so there are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.
3. There are 4 parks in your city that you enjoy visiting, so there are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

According to the principle you mentioned, if no two actions can be performed at the same time (meaning you can only do one thing each weekend), then there are p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 different ways to spend your weekend.

So, you have 9 different options for your weekend activity.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)=2^n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example.

Suppose you have a set of n books on your shelf and you want to choose some to take on a trip. You could take 1 book, 2 books, 3 books, and so on, up to n books. Or, you could decide not to take any books at all.

The number of ways to choose k books from n is given by the combination formula C(n, k). If you sum up all these possibilities from k=0 to n (including the possibility of taking no books), you get the total number of different combinations of books you could take.

According to the formula sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k) = 2^n, there are 2^n different combinations of books you could take. 

For example, if you have 3 books (n=3), there are 2^3 = 8 different combinations of books you could take: no books, any one of the three books, any two of the three books, or all three books. 

Note: The sum starts from k=0 because it includes the possibility of choosing no items.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, k)=C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example.

Suppose you have a group of 10 friends (n=10) and you want to form a team for a basketball game. The team needs 5 players (k=5).

The number of ways to choose 5 players from 10 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), which is C(10, 5).

However, choosing 5 players from 10 is the same as leaving out 5 players (n-k=10-5=5). So, the number of ways to choose 5 players to leave out is also C(10, 5).

Therefore, C(10, 5) = C(10, 10-5) = C(10, 5), which demonstrates the principle that C(n, k) = C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The problem involves choosing n objects out of 3n+1 objects, where n of these objects are indistinguishable and the remaining 2n+1 objects are distinct.

We can break this problem into two cases:

1. We choose k indistinguishable objects and n-k distinguishable objects. 

The number of ways to choose k indistinguishable objects out of n is always 1, because all indistinguishable objects are the same.

The number of ways to choose n-k distinguishable objects out of 2n+1 is given by the combination formula C(2n+1, n-k).

2. We sum over all possible values of k from 0 to n.

The total number of ways to choose n objects is therefore given by the sum of the number of ways to choose for each possible value of k:

sum_(k=0)^n C(2n+1, n-k)

This is the final expression for the number of ways to choose n objects out of 3n+1 where n are indistinguishable and the remaining ones are distinct.</code></pre>
