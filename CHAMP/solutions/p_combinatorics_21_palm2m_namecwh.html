<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of division.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of division is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of event A occurring, given that event B has already occurred, is equal to the probability of event A occurring and event B occurring divided by the probability of event B occurring. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred is 0.5 / 0.6 = 0.833.

The rule of division can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of getting a head on a coin toss after getting a tail on the previous toss, the probability of getting a six on a die after getting a five on the previous roll, or the probability of getting a black card after getting a red card.

The rule of division is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of division is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of getting a head on a coin toss is not affected by the probability of getting a tail on the previous toss.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of division cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of getting a six on a die after getting a five on the previous roll is not equal to the probability of getting a six on a die divided by the probability of getting a five on a die. This is because the probability of getting a six on a die after getting a five on the previous roll is affected by the fact that the die is not a fair die.

The rule of division is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of either event A or event B occurring is 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1.

The rule of sum can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of getting heads or tails on a coin toss, the probability of getting a number between 1 and 6 on a die, or the probability of getting a red card or a black card from a deck of cards.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of sum is only valid if the events are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. For example, getting heads and tails on a coin toss are mutually exclusive events.

If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of getting a number between 1 and 6 on a die is not equal to the sum of the probabilities of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This is because the events of getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are not mutually exclusive.

The rule of sum is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 6! = 720 ways to color the faces of a cube with 6 different colors. However, many of these colorings are equivalent up to rotations. For example, the colorings red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange and orange-white-yellow-green-blue-red are the same, since they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube.

To count the number of distinct colorings, we can first consider the case where the second face is painted on the top. There are 6 ways to choose the color for the second face, and then 5! = 120 ways to color the remaining four faces. However, we need to divide this by 2, since the two colorings that are obtained by rotating the cube are the same. So there are $6 \times \frac{120}{2} = 360$ colorings with the second face on top.

Now consider the case where the second face is painted on the side. There are 6 ways to choose the color for the second face, and then 4! = 24 ways to color the remaining four faces. However, we need to divide this by 2, since the four colorings that are obtained by rotating the cube around the axis that passes through the second face are the same. So there are $6 \times \frac{24}{2} = 120$ colorings with the second face on the side.

In total, there are $360 + 120 = 480$ distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors.</code></pre>
