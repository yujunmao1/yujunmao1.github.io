<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of possible arrangements of the trees and the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other.

Step-wise solution:
1. The total number of possible arrangements can be found by calculating the number of permutations of the 8 trees. This can be done using the formula for permutations of objects with repetition, which is given by n! / (n1! * n2! * ... * nk!), where n is the total number of objects and n1, n2, ..., nk are the number of repetitions of each object.
   In this case, we have 8 trees, so the total number of arrangements is 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 3360.

2. To find the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other, we can use the concept of &quot;stars and bars&quot; or &quot;sticks and stones&quot;. We can think of the apple trees as &quot;stars&quot; and the other trees as &quot;bars&quot; that separate them.
   We need to arrange the 3 apple trees and 5 bars (3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees) in a row, such that no two apple trees are adjacent. This can be done by placing the apple trees in the spaces between the bars.
   There are 6 spaces between the 5 bars, and we need to choose 3 of these spaces to place the apple trees. This can be calculated using combinations, which is given by C(6, 3) = 20.

3. Therefore, the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other is 20.

4. The probability of this event occurring is given by the number of favorable outcomes (arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other) divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   So, the probability is 20 / 3360 = 1 / 168.

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is 1/168.</code></pre>
