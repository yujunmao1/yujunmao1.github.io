<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We define P(k) as the number of strings with k number of 1s, so P(k)=C(n, k)*3^(n-k).
2. Thus, the number of length-n strings with an even number of 1s is E(n)=P(0)+P(2)+...=C(n, 0)*3^n+C(n, 2)*3^(n-2)....
3. The number of length-n strings with an odd number of 1s is O(n)=P(1)+P(3)+...=C(n, 1)*3^(n-1)+C(n, 3)*3^(n-3)....
4. We have E(n)+O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*1^k=(3+1)^n=4^n.
5. In addition, E(n)-O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*(-1)^k=(3-1)^n=2^n.
6. Thus, E(n)=(4^n+2^n)/2.

Problem: Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?
Step-wise solution:
1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.
2. We can paint it on top, the remaining four faces have 4! colorings, but we can rotate the cube four times, which makes four colorings the same, so we 4!/4=6 distinct colorings.
3. If the second face is on the side, we can put it on the front, and the two faces uniquely fix the rotation.
4. Thus, any coloring of the remaining four faces is distinct, and we have 4!=24 colorings.
5. In total, we have 30 colorings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. A rotation of the table preserves the neighboring relationship.
2. A reflection (mirroring) of the table through the center preserves the neighboring relationship.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of counting the distinct arrangements of n people sitting around a circular table, we need to consider the symmetries of the circle. Specifically, we need to account for the fact that rotating the table doesn&#x27;t change the neighboring relationships between people, and neither does reflecting the table through its center.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the rotations. If we fix one person in a position, then there are (n-1)! ways to arrange the remaining n-1 people around the table. This is because the circular nature of the table means that we can consider one seat as a reference point, and then arrange the others relative to that seat. This eliminates the rotational symmetry from our count.

Now, we need to consider the reflections. Each arrangement of people can be reflected through the center of the table to produce a mirror image. This reflection symmetry means that each arrangement is equivalent to its mirror image. However, there is one exception: if n is odd, the arrangement where each person is opposite to their mirror position is unique and cannot be paired with a different arrangement. This means that for odd n, we have one extra unique arrangement.

Putting this together, we have:

- For even n, each arrangement has a distinct mirror image, so we divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for reflection symmetry. Thus, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! / 2.
- For odd n, we have the same (n-1)! / 2 distinct arrangements, but we need to add 1 for the unique arrangement where each person is opposite to their mirror position.

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of n people sitting around a circular table, accounting for both rotational and reflectional symmetry, is:

For even n: (n-1)! / 2
For odd n: ((n-1)! / 2) + 1

However, the additional unique arrangement for odd n is already included in the (n-1)! / 2 count, because when we fix one person and arrange the others, the unique arrangement is one of those counted. So, we don&#x27;t need to add 1 for odd n.

Thus, the final expression for the number of distinct arrangements of n people sitting around a circular table is:

(n-1)! / 2

This expression is valid for both even and odd n.</code></pre>
