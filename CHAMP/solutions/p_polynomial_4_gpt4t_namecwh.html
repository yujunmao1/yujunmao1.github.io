<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r ≠ 1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the positivity of P(x) when x≤0.
2. For x&gt;0, study the positivity of x*P(x)+P(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine for how many values of \( n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \) the polynomial \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root, we can use the properties of polynomials and the given hints.

First, let&#x27;s study the positivity of \( P(x) \) when \( x \leq 0 \).

For \( x \leq 0 \), each term in the polynomial \( P(x) \) that has an even power of \( x \) will be non-negative because an even power of a non-positive number is non-negative. The terms with odd powers of \( x \) will be non-positive because an odd power of a non-positive number is non-positive, and these terms have negative coefficients, which makes the product non-negative. The constant term \( 2n+1 \) is always positive. Therefore, for \( x \leq 0 \), \( P(x) \) is a sum of non-negative terms, which means \( P(x) \geq 0 \).

Next, for \( x &gt; 0 \), let&#x27;s study the positivity of \( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) \).

\( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) = P(x)(x + 1) \)

Expanding \( P(x)(x + 1) \), we get:

\( P(x)(x + 1) = x^{2n+1} - x^{2n} + 3x^{2n-1} - 4x^{2n-2} + \ldots - 2nx^2 + (2n+1)x \)

Notice that when we multiply \( P(x) \) by \( x + 1 \), the negative terms in \( P(x) \) will be &quot;canceled out&quot; by the corresponding positive terms from the multiplication by \( x \). This is because the polynomial \( P(x) \) has terms that decrease the exponent by 1 and increase the coefficient by 1 in absolute value. Therefore, \( P(x)(x + 1) \) will have all non-negative coefficients for \( x &gt; 0 \), and since \( x &gt; 0 \), \( P(x)(x + 1) \geq 0 \).

Now, we know that \( P(x) \geq 0 \) for \( x \leq 0 \) and \( P(x)(x + 1) \geq 0 \) for \( x &gt; 0 \). Since \( P(x) \) is continuous and differentiable everywhere (as it is a polynomial), if \( P(x) \) has a real root, it must cross the x-axis. However, from our analysis, \( P(x) \) does not become negative for any \( x \), which means it never crosses the x-axis.

Therefore, \( P(x) \) does not have any real roots for any \( n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \). The answer to the question is that there are 0 values of \( n \) for which \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root.</code></pre>
