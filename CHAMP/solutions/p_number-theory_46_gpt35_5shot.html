What is the smallest value of a^3+b^3+c^3-a^2*b-b^2*c-c^2*a for positive a, b, c?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Consider the two sequences (a^2, b^2, c^2), and (a, b, c), which are sorted in the same way.
2. Thus, S=a^2*a+b^2*b+c^2*c≥a^2*b+b^2*c+c^2*a=T.
3. So S-T≥0.
4. So the smallest value is 0, achieved when a=b=c.</code></pre>

For the polynomial x^3+4x^2+2x+a, what value of a results in one root being equal to the sum of the other two roots?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let the three roots be x_1, x_2, x_3 and suppose that x_3=x_1+x_2.
2. We have x_1+x_2+x_3=-4, x_1*x_2+x_2*x_3+x_1*x_3=2 and x_1*x_2*x_3=-a.
3. Thus, we have x_1+x_2=x_3=-2 from the first equation.
4. From the second equation, we have x_1*x_2=2-x_3*(x_1+x_2)=2-(-2)*(-2)=-2.
5. Thus, a=-x_1*x_2*x_3=-(-2)*(-2)=-4.</code></pre>

Let x_i&gt;0, and s=x_1+x_2+···+x_n. What is the smallest value of s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n) in terms of n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have (s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n))((s-x_1)/s+(s-x_2)/s+...+(s-x_n)/s)=(s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n))((ns-s)/s)=(s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n))(n-1).
2. We also have (s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n))((s-x_1)/s+(s-x_2)/s+...+(s-x_n)/s)≥n^2.
3. Thus, s/(s-x_1)+s/(s-x_2)+...+s/(s-x_n)≥n^2/(n-1), with equality being achieved when each of s-x_i is equal.
4. So the smallest value is n^2/(n-1).</code></pre>

Find all integer values of m such that 1000^m-1 is a factor of 1978^m-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have 1978^m-1000^m=(2*989)^m-(2*500)^m=2^m*(989^m-500^m).
2. Since 1000^m-1 is an odd number, gcd(2^m, 1000^m-1)=1.
3. Thus, if 1000^m-1 | 1978^m-1000^m, we must have 1000^m-1 | 989^m-500^m.
4. But the divisibility cannot be true since 989^m-500^m&lt;1000^m-1.
5. So 1000^m-1 ∤ 1978^m-1000^m.
6. Since 1978^m-1000^m=(1978^m-1)-(1000^m-1), we have 1000^m-1 ∤ 1978^m-1.
7. Thus, there is no such integer m.</code></pre>

For positive a, b, c, at most how many of the three inequalities a(1-b)&gt;1/4, b(1-c)&gt;1/4, c(1-a)&gt;1/4 can be true at the same time?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We can see that a=0.9, b=0.5, c=0.1 makes a(1-b)=0.45&gt;1/4 and b(1-c)=0.45&gt;1/4.
2. Assume that all three inequalities are true.
3. Since we have a, b, c&gt;0, we must have a, b, c&lt;1 for the three inequalities to hold.
4. Thus, we need to have a(1-a)*b(1-b)*c(1-c)&gt;(1/4)^3.
5. However, we know that a(1-a)=-a^2+a=-(a-1/2)^2+1/4≤1/4, and the same for b, c.
6. Thus, we cannot have a(1-a)*b(1-b)*c(1-c)&gt;(1/4)^3, so the three inequalities cannot be true at the same time.
7. So at most 2 inequalities can be true.</code></pre>

For positive integer n for which 2n+1 and 3n+1 are both perfect squares, what are possible values of n mod 40?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let 2n+1 = x^2 and 3n+1 = y^2, where x and y are positive integers.
2. Rearranging the equations, we have 2n = x^2 - 1 and 3n = y^2 - 1.
3. Since n is a positive integer, we have x^2 - 1 &gt; 0 and y^2 - 1 &gt; 0.
4. This implies x &gt; 1 and y &gt; 1.
5. We can rewrite the equations as n = (x^2 - 1)/2 and n = (y^2 - 1)/3.
6. Since n is an integer, both (x^2 - 1) and (y^2 - 1) must be divisible by 2 and 3, respectively.
7. This means x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2) and y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).
8. Solving x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 2), we find that x ≡ 1 (mod 2).
9. Solving y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), we find that y ≡ 1 or y ≡ 2 (mod 3).
10. Combining the congruences, we have x ≡ 1 (mod 2) and y ≡ 1 or y ≡ 2 (mod 3).
11. We can express x as x = 2a + 1 and y as y = 3b + 1, where a and b are non-negative integers.
12. Substituting these values into the equations, we have n = (4a^2 + 4a)/2 = 2a(a + 1) and n = (9b^2 + 6b)/3 = 3b(b + 1).
13. Simplifying, we have n = a(a + 1) and n = 3b(b + 1).
14. Since n is a positive integer, we have a(a + 1) &gt; 0 and 3b(b + 1) &gt; 0.
15. This implies a &gt; -1 and b &gt; -1.
16. We can conclude that a and b are non-negative integers.
17. Now, we need to find the possible values of n mod 40.
18. We can consider the values of a and b mod 40 to determine the possible values of n mod 40.
