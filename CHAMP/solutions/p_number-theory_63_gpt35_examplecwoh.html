A number is a multiple of 4 if and only if the number consisting of its last two digit is divisible by 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s take the number 248.

To determine if 248 is a multiple of 4, we can check if the number formed by its last two digits (48) is divisible by 4.

Since 48 is divisible by 4 (48 ÷ 4 = 12), we can conclude that 248 is indeed a multiple of 4.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s use the concept to solve an example.

Consider the following equation: (7 + 9) mod 5 = ((7 mod 5) + (9 mod 5)) mod 5.

To solve this equation, we first evaluate the expressions on both sides of the equation:

On the left side: (7 + 9) mod 5 = 16 mod 5 = 1.

On the right side: ((7 mod 5) + (9 mod 5)) mod 5 = (2 + 4) mod 5 = 6 mod 5 = 1.

Since both sides of the equation evaluate to the same value (1), we can conclude that the equation (7 + 9) mod 5 = ((7 mod 5) + (9 mod 5)) mod 5 holds true.

This example demonstrates the concept that when performing modular arithmetic, we can break down complex expressions into simpler expressions by applying the modular operation to each individual term and then performing the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or exponentiation) on the resulting remainders.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the expression 385^1980 + 18^1980 is a perfect square, we can simplify the expression using the concept of modular arithmetic.

Let&#x27;s start by considering each term separately:

385^1980 mod 10:
Since we are only interested in the last digit, we can apply the concept that a number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0. The last digit of 385 is 5, and any power of 5 will always end in 5. Therefore, 385^1980 mod 10 = 5.

18^1980 mod 10:
Similarly, the last digit of 18 is 8, and any power of 8 will always end in 8. Therefore, 18^1980 mod 10 = 8.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 10:
Since we are only interested in the last digit, we can add the last digits of each term: 5 + 8 = 13. The last digit of 13 is 3. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 10 = 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 4:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 4:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 4, we can evaluate each term modulo 4. The remainder of 385 divided by 4 is 1, and the remainder of 18 divided by 4 is 2. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 4 = (1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 4.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 4 if its last two digits are divisible by 4, we can simplify further:

(1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 4:
The last two digits of 1^1980 are 01, which is divisible by 4. The last two digits of 2^1980 are also 01, which is divisible by 4. Therefore, (1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 4 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 3:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 3:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 3, we can evaluate each term modulo 3. The remainder of 385 divided by 3 is 2, and the remainder of 18 divided by 3 is 0. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 3 = (2^1980 + 0^1980) mod 3.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, we can simplify further:

(2^1980 + 0^1980) mod 3:
The sum of the digits of 2^1980 is 2, which is not divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 0^1980 is 0, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, (2^1980 + 0^1980) mod 3 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 9:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 9:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 9, we can evaluate each term modulo 9. The remainder of 385 divided by 9 is 5, and the remainder of 18 divided by 9 is 0. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 9 = (5^1980 + 0^1980) mod 9.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9, we can simplify further:

(5^1980 + 0^1980) mod 9:
The sum of the digits of 5^1980 is 5, which is not divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of 0^1980 is 0, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, (5^1980 + 0^1980) mod 9 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 5:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 5:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 5, we can evaluate each term modulo 5. The remainder of 385 divided by 5 is 0, and the remainder of 18 divided by 5 is 3. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 5 = (0^1980 + 3^1980) mod 5.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5, we can simplify further:

(0^1980 + 3^1980) mod 5:
The last digit of 0^1980 is 0, which is divisible by 5. The last digit of 3^1980 is 1, which is not divisible by 5. Therefore, (0^1980 + 3^1980) mod 5 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 7:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 7:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 7, we can evaluate each term modulo 7. The remainder of 385 divided by 7 is 0, and the remainder of 18 divided by 7 is 4. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 7 = (0^1980 + 4^1980) mod 7.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 7 if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, we can simplify further:

(0^1980 + 4^1980) mod 7:
The difference between twice the units digit of 0^1980 and the remaining digits is 0, which is divisible by 7. The difference between twice the units digit of 4^1980 and the remaining digits is also 0, which is divisible by 7. Therefore, (0^1980 + 4^1980) mod 7 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 8:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 8:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 8, we can evaluate each term modulo 8. The remainder of 385 divided by 8 is 1, and the remainder of 18 divided by 8 is 2. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 8 = (1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 8.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits are divisible by 8, we can simplify further:

(1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 8:
The last three digits of 1^1980 are 001, which is divisible by 8. The last three digits of 2^1980 are also 001, which is divisible by 8. Therefore, (1^1980 + 2^1980) mod 8 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 6:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 6:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 6, we can evaluate each term modulo 6. The remainder of 385 divided by 6 is 1, and the remainder of 18 divided by 6 is 0. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 6 = (1^1980 + 0^1980) mod 6.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3, we can simplify further:

(1^1980 + 0^1980) mod 6:
The number 1 is divisible by both 2 and 3, and the number 0 is divisible by both 2 and 3. Therefore, (1^1980 + 0^1980) mod 6 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 25:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 25:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 25, we can evaluate each term modulo 25. The remainder of 385 divided by 25 is 10, and the remainder of 18 divided by 25 is 18. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 25 = (10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 25.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are divisible by 25, we can simplify further:

(10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 25:
The last two digits of 10^1980 are 00, which is divisible by 25. The last two digits of 18^1980 are also 00, which is divisible by 25. Therefore, (10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 25 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 125:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 125:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 125, we can evaluate each term modulo 125. The remainder of 385 divided by 125 is 10, and the remainder of 18 divided by 125 is 18. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 125 = (10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 125.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 125 if its last three digits are divisible by 125, we can simplify further:

(10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 125:
The last three digits of 10^1980 are 000, which is divisible by 125. The last three digits of 18^1980 are also 000, which is divisible by 125. Therefore, (10^1980 + 18^1980) mod 125 = 0.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of these two terms modulo 100:

(385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100:
Since we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 100, we can evaluate each term modulo 100. The remainder of 385 divided by 100 is 85, and the remainder of 18 divided by 100 is 18. Therefore, (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100 = (85^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100.

Using the concept that a number is divisible by 100 if its last two digits are divisible by 100, we can simplify further:

(85^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100:
The last two digits of 85^1980 are 25, which is not divisible by 100. The last two digits of 18^1980 are 24, which is not divisible by 100. Therefore, (85^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100 ≠ 0.

Since the expression (385^1980 + 18^1980) mod 100 ≠ 0, we can conclude that the expression 385^1980 + 18^1980 is not a perfect square.</code></pre>
