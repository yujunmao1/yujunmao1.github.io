<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 6 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2 and 3 have the property that any two adjacent digits differ by at most 1.

You may find the following information useful:

1. C(n, r)=n!/(r!*(n-r)!)=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-r+1)/r!.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 3 choices for each of the 6 digits, so there are $3^6 = 729$ total strings of length 6 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, and 3.

To count the number of strings with the desired property, we can first count the number of strings with no restrictions, and then subtract the number of strings with adjacent digits that differ by more than 1.

The number of strings with no restrictions is $3^6$.

To count the number of strings with adjacent digits that differ by more than 1, we can consider the following cases:

* The first two digits are different. There are $2$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the second digit, so there are $2 \times 3 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The first and third digits are different. There are $2$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the third digit, so there are $2 \times 3 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The first and fourth digits are different. There are $2$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the fourth digit, so there are $2 \times 3 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The first and fifth digits are different. There are $2$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the fifth digit, so there are $2 \times 3 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The first and sixth digits are different. There are $2$ choices for the first digit, and $3$ choices for the sixth digit, so there are $2 \times 3 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The second and third digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the second digit, and $2$ choices for the third digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The second and fourth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the second digit, and $2$ choices for the fourth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The second and fifth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the second digit, and $2$ choices for the fifth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The second and sixth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the second digit, and $2$ choices for the sixth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The third and fourth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the third digit, and $2$ choices for the fourth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The third and fifth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the third digit, and $2$ choices for the fifth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The third and sixth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the third digit, and $2$ choices for the sixth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The fourth and fifth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the fourth digit, and $2$ choices for the fifth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The fourth and sixth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the fourth digit, and $2$ choices for the sixth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.
* The fifth and sixth digits are different. There are $3$ choices for the fifth digit, and $2$ choices for the sixth digit, so there are $3 \times 2 = 6$ strings in this case.

In total, there are $6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 48$ strings with adjacent digits that differ by more than 1.

Therefore, the number of strings of length 6 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, and 3 with the property that any two adjacent digits differ by at most 1 is $729 - 48 = 681$.</code></pre>
