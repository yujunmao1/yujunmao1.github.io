C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s say we have a group of 5 students and we want to choose a committee of 3 students from this group. We can use the concept of combinations to calculate the number of possible committees.

Using the formula C(n, k) = n/k * C(n-1, k-1), we can calculate the number of possible committees as follows:

C(5, 3) = 5/3 * C(4, 2)

To calculate C(4, 2), we can apply the formula again:

C(4, 2) = 4/2 * C(3, 1)

Finally, we calculate C(3, 1):

C(3, 1) = 3/1 * C(2, 0)

Since C(2, 0) is defined as 1, we can substitute it in:

C(3, 1) = 3/1 * 1 = 3

Now, we can substitute the values back into the previous equations:

C(4, 2) = 4/2 * 3 = 6

C(5, 3) = 5/3 * 6 = 10

Therefore, there are 10 possible committees that can be formed from a group of 5 students when choosing 3 students.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s say we have a group of 8 people and we want to choose a team of 5 from this group. We can use the concept of combinations to calculate the number of possible teams.

Using the formula C(n, k) = C(n, n-k), we can calculate the number of possible teams as follows:

C(8, 5) = C(8, 8-5)

To calculate C(8, 8-5), we can substitute the values:

C(8, 5) = C(8, 3)

Now, we can use the formula for combinations to calculate C(8, 3):

C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * (8-3)!)

Simplifying the expression:

C(8, 3) = 8! / (3! * 5!)

Cancelling out common factors:

C(8, 3) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1)

Calculating the numerator and denominator:

C(8, 3) = 336 / 6

Simplifying the fraction:

C(8, 3) = 56

Therefore, there are 56 possible teams that can be formed from a group of 8 people when choosing 5 people.</code></pre>

A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider the sequence {1/n}, where n is a positive integer. This sequence is monotonically decreasing and bounded from above by 1.

To show that this sequence has a limit, we can use the concept of the limit of a sequence. 

First, let&#x27;s prove that the sequence is monotonically decreasing. For any two terms in the sequence, say 1/n and 1/(n+1), we can see that 1/n &gt; 1/(n+1) since n+1 &gt; n. Therefore, the sequence is monotonically decreasing.

Next, let&#x27;s prove that the sequence is bounded from above. We can see that all terms in the sequence are less than or equal to 1. Therefore, the sequence is bounded from above by 1.

Since the sequence is monotonically decreasing and bounded from above, according to the concept mentioned, it has a limit.

To find the limit of the sequence, we can take the limit as n approaches infinity:

lim(n→∞) 1/n = 0

Therefore, the sequence {1/n} has a limit of 0.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let the sequence be defined as a_n=1/C(n, 0)+1/C(n, 1)+...+1/C(n, n). Does the limit of the sequence exist, and if so, what is it?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the relationship between a_n and a_(n-1).
2. For even n, express a_n in terms of a_(n-1) by isolating the first term and grouping each pair of the terms from the two ends.
3. For odd n, express a_n in terms of a_(n-1) by isolating the first term, grouping each pair of the terms from the two ends and adding the remaining middle term.
4. Write out the first few terms of a_n up to a_5 and study the relationship between a_n and 2+2/n.
5. Study the monotonicity of the sequence after a_4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the limit of the sequence defined as a_n = 1/C(n, 0) + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n), we will follow the given instructions and analyze the relationship between the terms.

1. Relationship between a_n and a_(n-1):
Let&#x27;s start by examining the relationship between a_n and a_(n-1). We can express a_n in terms of a_(n-1) by isolating the first term and grouping each pair of terms from the two ends.

For even n:
a_n = 1/C(n, 0) + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n)
     = 1 + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n-1) + 1/C(n, n)
     = 1 + 1/C(n, n) + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n-1)
     = 1 + 1/C(n, n) + 1/C(n, n-1) + ... + 1/C(n, 1)
     = 1 + a_(n-1)

For odd n:
a_n = 1/C(n, 0) + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n)
     = 1 + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n-1) + 1/C(n, n)
     = 1 + 1/C(n, n) + 1/C(n, n-1) + ... + 1/C(n, 1)
     = 1 + a_(n-1) + 1/C(n, n/2)

2. Expressing a_n in terms of a_(n-1) for even n:
From the relationship above, we can see that for even n, a_n = 1 + a_(n-1).

3. Expressing a_n in terms of a_(n-1) for odd n:
From the relationship above, we can see that for odd n, a_n = 1 + a_(n-1) + 1/C(n, n/2).

4. First few terms of a_n up to a_5:
Let&#x27;s calculate the first few terms of a_n up to a_5 to study the relationship between a_n and 2 + 2/n.

For n = 1:
a_1 = 1/C(1, 0) + 1/C(1, 1)
     = 1/1 + 1/1
     = 2

For n = 2:
a_2 = 1/C(2, 0) + 1/C(2, 1) + 1/C(2, 2)
     = 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/1
     = 3

For n = 3:
a_3 = 1/C(3, 0) + 1/C(3, 1) + 1/C(3, 2) + 1/C(3, 3)
     = 1/1 + 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/1
     = 2 + 2/3

For n = 4:
a_4 = 1/C(4, 0) + 1/C(4, 1) + 1/C(4, 2) + 1/C(4, 3) + 1/C(4, 4)
     = 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/4 + 1/1
     = 2 + 2/3 + 1/2

For n = 5:
a_5 = 1/C(5, 0) + 1/C(5, 1) + 1/C(5, 2) + 1/C(5, 3) + 1/C(5, 4) + 1/C(5, 5)
     = 1/1 + 1/5 + 1/10 + 1/10 + 1/5 + 1/1
     = 2 + 2/3 + 1/2 + 2/5

From the calculations above, we can observe that a_n is closely related to 2 + 2/n.

5. Monotonicity of the sequence after a_4:
From the calculations above, we can see that the sequence is monotonically increasing after a_4. This is because each additional term in the sequence is positive and contributes to the sum, making the sequence larger.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the limit of the sequence:

For even n:
a_n = 1 + a_(n-1)
     = 1 + (1 + a_(n-2))
     = 1 + 1 + (1 + a_(n-3))
     = ...
     = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 + a_1
     = n/2 + 2

For odd n:
a_n = 1 + a_(n-1) + 1/C(n, n/2)
     = 1 + (1 + a_(n-2)) + 1/C(n, n/2)
     = 1 + 1 + (1 + a_(n-3)) + 1/C(n, n/2)
     = ...
     = 1 + 1 + ... + 1 + a_1 + 1/C(n, n/2)
     = n/2 + 2 + 1/C(n, n/2)

From the analysis above, we can see that the limit of the sequence does exist. As n approaches infinity, the terms n/2 and 1/C(n, n/2) become negligible compared to the constant term 2. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is 2.

In conclusion, the limit of the sequence defined as a_n = 1/C(n, 0) + 1/C(n, 1) + ... + 1/C(n, n) is 2.</code></pre>
