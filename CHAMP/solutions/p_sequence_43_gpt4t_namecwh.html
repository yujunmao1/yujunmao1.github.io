<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r â‰  1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Is it possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... such that the sum is 1/7, and if so, what is the sequence?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Assume that the geometric sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a ratio of 1/2^b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find values of a and b such that the infinite geometric sequence starting with the term 1/2^a and having a common ratio of 1/2^b sums up to 1/7.

The sum of an infinite geometric series with the first term a and common ratio r (where |r| &lt; 1) is given by:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

In our case, the first term of the sequence is 1/2^a, and the common ratio is 1/2^b. Plugging these into the sum formula for an infinite geometric series, we get:

S_infinity = (1/2^a) / (1 - (1/2^b))

We want this sum to equal 1/7, so we set up the equation:

(1/2^a) / (1 - (1/2^b)) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying to solve for a and b, we get:

1/2^a = 1/7 * (1 - (1/2^b))
1/2^a = (1 - (1/2^b)) / 7

Now, we need to find integer values of a and b that satisfy this equation. Since the sequence starts with 1/2^a, a must be a positive integer. Similarly, b must be a positive integer for the common ratio 1/2^b to be a fraction between 0 and 1.

Let&#x27;s rewrite the right side of the equation to have a common denominator:

1/2^a = (7/7 - 1/2^b) / 7
1/2^a = (7 - 2^b) / (7 * 2^b)

For the two fractions to be equal, their numerators must be equal (since the denominators are already powers of 2):

1 = 7 - 2^b
2^b = 7 - 1
2^b = 6

Now we need to find a value of b such that 2^b equals 6. However, there is no integer b that satisfies this equation because 2^b is always a power of 2, and 6 is not a power of 2. Therefore, it is not possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the given sequence such that the sum is 1/7.</code></pre>
