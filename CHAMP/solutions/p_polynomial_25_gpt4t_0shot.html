<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For how many values of n in {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} can f(x)=x^n+5x^(nâˆ’1)+3 be written as g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are both polynomials of integer coefficients with degree at least 1?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine for how many values of \( n \) the polynomial \( f(x) = x^n + 5x^{n-1} + 3 \) can be factored into two polynomials \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) with integer coefficients, we need to consider the possible factors of the constant term and the leading coefficient.

The constant term of \( f(x) \) is 3, which has the following integer factors: \( \pm1, \pm3 \). The leading coefficient is 1, which has only one factor: \( \pm1 \).

For \( f(x) \) to be factorable into two polynomials with integer coefficients, the constant term of \( f(x) \) must be the product of the constant terms of \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \). Since the leading coefficient of \( f(x) \) is 1, the leading coefficients of \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) must also be \( \pm1 \) to ensure that the product of the leading coefficients is 1.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible factorizations of the constant term 3. We have two possibilities:

1. \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) have constant terms that are 1 and 3 (or -1 and -3), respectively.
2. \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) have constant terms that are -1 and -3 (or 1 and 3), respectively.

However, we must also consider that the polynomial \( f(x) \) has a term \( 5x^{n-1} \). For \( f(x) \) to be factorable into polynomials with integer coefficients, the sum of the products of the coefficients of \( x \) terms in \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) must equal 5. This means that one of the polynomials must have a term with a coefficient that is a factor of 5, and the other must have a term with a coefficient that, when multiplied together, gives 5.

The factors of 5 are \( \pm1 \) and \( \pm5 \). Since the degrees of \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) must be at least 1, and the leading coefficients are \( \pm1 \), we can have the following scenarios for the \( x \) terms:

1. One polynomial has an \( x \) term with a coefficient of \( \pm1 \), and the other has an \( x \) term with a coefficient of \( \pm5 \).
2. Both polynomials have \( x \) terms with coefficients of \( \pm1 \), and the exponents of \( x \) add up to \( n-1 \).

However, we must also ensure that the sum of the products of the coefficients of the \( x \) terms equals 5. This means that we cannot have both coefficients as -1, as this would give us a sum of -5.

Given these constraints, we can see that the polynomial \( f(x) \) can only be factored into two polynomials with integer coefficients if the \( x \) terms in \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) have coefficients that multiply to 5 and add up to 5 when considering the constant terms as well.

Since the constant term of \( f(x) \) is 3, and we cannot change this, we must have one of the polynomials with a constant term of 1 and the other with a constant term of 3. The \( x \) terms must then have coefficients that multiply to 5 and add up to 5.

The only way this is possible is if one polynomial has an \( x \) term with a coefficient of 1 and the other has an \( x \) term with a coefficient of 5. This is because if we had a coefficient of -1 and -5, the sum would be -6, not 5.

Therefore, the polynomial \( f(x) \) can be factored into two polynomials with integer coefficients for all values of \( n \) in the set \( \{2, 3, 4, \ldots, 1993\} \), since the constraints on the constant term and the \( x \) terms can always be satisfied regardless of the value of \( n \).

The final answer is that \( f(x) \) can be factored for all 1992 values of \( n \) in the given set.</code></pre>
