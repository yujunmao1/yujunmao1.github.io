The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a deck of 52 cards. You want to choose a hand of 5 cards. The number of ways to do this is $C(52, 5) = 2,598,960$.

Another example is if you have a group of 10 people and you want to choose a committee of 3 people. The number of ways to do this is $C(10, 3) = 120$.

In general, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is given by the formula $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$ and $k!$ is the factorial of $k$.

The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, $5! = 120$ because $120 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$.

The formula for $C(n, k)$ can be derived using the following argument. Let&#x27;s say we want to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items. We can do this by first choosing the first item, then the second item, and so on until we have chosen $k$ items. There are $n$ choices for the first item, $n-1$ choices for the second item, and so on. So, the total number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.

However, this overcounts the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items, because it doesn&#x27;t take into account the order in which we choose the items. For example, the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is the same set as the set $\\{3, 2, 1\\}$. So, we need to divide the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items by the number of ways to order $k$ items. The number of ways to order $k$ items is $k!$. So, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$.</code></pre>

We can also use the formula to calculate the number of ways to choose a hand of 5 cards from a deck of 52 cards. The number of ways to do this is $C(52, 5) = \frac{52!}{5!(52-5)!} = \frac{52 \cdot 51 \cdot 50 \cdot 49 \cdot 48}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 2,598,960$.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is $\frac{10}{120} = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$.

We can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable. This means that there are 8 indistinguishable objects to be arranged in a row. The number of ways to do this is $8!$.

We can then divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 apple trees in a row, which is 3!. This gives us $8!/3!$.

We can also divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 5 other trees in a row, which is 5!. This gives us $8!/3!5!$.

However, this overcounts the number of arrangements, because it doesn&#x27;t take into account the fact that the apple trees are indistinguishable. So, we need to divide the number of arrangements by the number of ways to order the 3 apple trees. The number of ways to order 3 objects is 3!. So, the number of arrangements of the 8 indistinguishable objects is $\frac{8!}{3!5!}$.

We can now consider the 3 apple trees as 3 distinct objects, and the 5 other trees as 5 distinct objects. This means that there are 8 distinct objects to be arranged in a row. The number of ways to do this is $8!$.

We can then divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 3 apple trees in a row, which is 3!. This gives us $8!/3!$.

We can also divide this by the number of ways to arrange the 5 other trees in a row, which is 5!. This gives us $8!/3!5!$.

This is the number of arrangements of the 8 distinct objects such that no two apple trees are next to each other.

The probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is the number of arrangements of the 8 distinct objects such that no two apple trees are next to each other divided by the number of arrangements of the 8 indistinguishable objects. This is $\frac{8!/3!5!}{8!/3!5!} = \boxed{\frac{1}{12}}$.</code></pre>
