<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The cube of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that express the cube of a sum or difference of two numbers in terms of the individual numbers and their powers. These formulas are useful for expanding expressions that involve cubed binomials.

The cube of sum formula is given by:

(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

This formula states that the cube of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the cube of the second number.

Similarly, the cube of difference formula is given by:

(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

This formula states that the cube of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the difference of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the negative of the cube of the second number.

Both formulas can be derived from the binomial theorem or by directly multiplying out the binomial (a + b) or (a - b) three times. They are particularly useful in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics where simplifying expressions involving cubes is necessary.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that express the square of a sum or difference of two numbers in terms of the individual numbers and their products. These formulas are useful for expanding expressions that involve squared binomials.

The square of sum formula is given by:

(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

This formula states that the square of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the square of the first number, twice the product of the first and second numbers, and the square of the second number.

Similarly, the square of difference formula is given by:

(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

This formula states that the square of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the square of the first number, minus twice the product of the first and second numbers, plus the square of the second number.

Both formulas can be derived by directly multiplying out the binomial (a + b) or (a - b) two times. They are also special cases of the binomial theorem for the power of 2. These identities are widely used in algebra to simplify expressions, solve equations, and in various applications across mathematics and related fields.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: polynomial division definition.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Polynomial division is a process similar to long division for numbers, but it is used to divide one polynomial by another. The goal of polynomial division is to determine how many times the divisor polynomial can &quot;fit&quot; into the dividend polynomial, and to express the result as a quotient with or without a remainder.

There are two common methods for dividing polynomials:

1. Long Division: This method is analogous to the long division of integers. It involves writing the dividend and divisor polynomials in descending order of their degrees, then repeatedly subtracting multiples of the divisor from the dividend until the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor. The result is a quotient polynomial and possibly a remainder.

2. Synthetic Division: This is a simplified form of long division that can be used when the divisor is a binomial of the form (x - c). Synthetic division is more efficient than long division in this case, as it involves fewer calculations. It is performed using a tabular method that allows you to find the quotient and remainder more quickly.

The general form of polynomial division is expressed as:

Dividend ÷ Divisor = Quotient + Remainder/Divisor

where the Dividend and Divisor are polynomials, the Quotient is the result of the division (also a polynomial), and the Remainder is what is left over, which is a polynomial of a lower degree than the Divisor.

Polynomial division is used in various mathematical procedures, including factoring polynomials, finding polynomial roots, and simplifying rational expressions. It is an important concept in algebra, precalculus, and calculus.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation x^3+x^2*y+x*y^2+y^3=8(x^2+xy+y^2+1).

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all integer solutions to the equation \(x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + y^3 = 8(x^2 + xy + y^2 + 1)\), we can start by simplifying and rearranging terms.

First, let&#x27;s expand the right side of the equation:

\[8(x^2 + xy + y^2 + 1) = 8x^2 + 8xy + 8y^2 + 8\]

Now, let&#x27;s rewrite the original equation with the expanded right side:

\[x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + y^3 = 8x^2 + 8xy + 8y^2 + 8\]

Next, we&#x27;ll move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:

\[x^3 + x^2y + xy^2 + y^3 - 8x^2 - 8xy - 8y^2 - 8 = 0\]

Now, let&#x27;s combine like terms:

\[x^3 - 7x^2 + x^2y - 7xy + xy^2 - 7y^2 + y^3 - 8 = 0\]

Group terms with common factors:

\[(x^3 - 7x^2) + (x^2y - 7xy) + (xy^2 - 7y^2) + (y^3 - 8) = 0\]

Factor out the common terms:

\[x^2(x - 7) + xy(x - 7) + y^2(x - 7) + (y^3 - 8) = 0\]

Notice that \(x - 7\) is a common factor in the first three terms, and \(y^3 - 8\) is a difference of cubes, which can be factored as \((y - 2)(y^2 + 2y + 4)\). Let&#x27;s factor these out:

\[(x - 7)(x^2 + xy + y^2) + (y - 2)(y^2 + 2y + 4) = 0\]

Now we have two separate factors that each could be equal to zero:

1. \((x - 7)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 0\)
2. \((y - 2)(y^2 + 2y + 4) = 0\)

Let&#x27;s solve each factor separately:

For the first factor:

\((x - 7)(x^2 + xy + y^2) = 0\)

This gives us two possibilities:

a. \(x - 7 = 0\), which means \(x = 7\)

b. \(x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0\)

However, \(x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0\) has no integer solutions because \(x^2 + xy + y^2\) is always positive for any real numbers \(x\) and \(y\) (it&#x27;s the sum of squares and a product term).

For the second factor:

\((y - 2)(y^2 + 2y + 4) = 0\)

This gives us two possibilities:

a. \(y - 2 = 0\), which means \(y = 2\)

b. \(y^2 + 2y + 4 = 0\)

However, \(y^2 + 2y + 4 = 0\) has no real solutions because the discriminant \(b^2 - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(4) = 4 - 16 = -12\) is negative, and thus there are no real (and hence no integer) solutions.

Combining the integer solutions we found:

\(x = 7\), \(y = 2\)

So the only integer solution to the original equation is \(x = 7\), \(y = 2\).</code></pre>
