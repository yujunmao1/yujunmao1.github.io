<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a factorization formula for a^n - 1, known as the difference of nth powers. It states that you can factor the expression a^n - 1 into (a - 1) times the sum of all lower powers of a, from a^(n-1) down to a^0 (which is 1).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a concrete example. We&#x27;ll use a = 3 and n = 4.

We want to factor 3^4 - 1. According to the formula, this should equal:

(3 - 1)(3^(4-1) + 3^(4-2) + 3^(4-3) + 3^(4-4))

Now, let&#x27;s calculate each part:

3^4 - 1 = 81 - 1 = 80

And for the right-hand side:

(3 - 1)(3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0) = (2)(27 + 9 + 3 + 1) = 2 * 40 = 80

As you can see, both sides of the equation are equal, confirming that the factorization is correct:

3^4 - 1 = (3 - 1)(3^3 + 3^2 + 3^1 + 3^0)
80 = 2 * 40
80 = 80

This demonstrates the application of the factorization formula for a^n - 1.</code></pre>

The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the difference of squares, which is a special case of factoring polynomials. It states that the difference between the squares of two terms x and y can be factored into the product of the sum and the difference of those two terms.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example where x = 5 and y = 3.

We want to factor x^2 - y^2 with these values. According to the formula, this should equal:

(5 + 3)(5 - 3)

Now, let&#x27;s calculate each part:

5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16

And for the right-hand side:

(5 + 3)(5 - 3) = (8)(2) = 16

As you can see, both sides of the equation are equal, confirming that the factorization is correct:

5^2 - 3^2 = (5 + 3)(5 - 3)
16 = 16

This demonstrates the application of the difference of squares formula.</code></pre>

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation 2^x+1=3^y.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study for x≥4 and odd y by considering the divisibility by 4.
2. Study the equation for x≥4 and even y.
3. Let y=2k and 3^k=2a+1.
4. Write the expression for 2^x in terms of a and study its odd factors (besides 1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all positive integer solutions to the equation 2^x + 1 = 3^y, we will consider the cases based on the parity of y and the divisibility by 4.

**Case 1: x ≥ 4 and y is odd**

If y is odd, then 3^y is also odd. Since 2^x is always even for x ≥ 1, 2^x + 1 will be odd. This is consistent with 3^y being odd. However, when x ≥ 4, 2^x is divisible by 4 (since 2^4 = 16 and any higher power of 2 will also be divisible by 4), which means 2^x + 1 will have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

On the other hand, 3^y for odd y will have a remainder of 3 when divided by 4 (since 3^1 = 3, 3^3 = 27, etc., and the pattern of remainders when powers of 3 are divided by 4 is 3, 1, 3, 1, ...). Therefore, 2^x + 1 cannot equal 3^y for x ≥ 4 and odd y, because they have different remainders when divided by 4.

**Case 2: x ≥ 4 and y is even**

Let y = 2k. Then 3^y = 3^(2k) = (3^k)^2. Since 3^k is odd, we can write it as 3^k = 2a + 1 for some integer a. Squaring both sides, we get:

(3^k)^2 = (2a + 1)^2
3^(2k) = 4a^2 + 4a + 1
3^y = 4a(a + 1) + 1

Now, we have 2^x + 1 = 3^y, which means:

2^x + 1 = 4a(a + 1) + 1

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

2^x = 4a(a + 1)

Since the right-hand side is divisible by 4, x must be at least 2 for the left-hand side to also be divisible by 4. We can rewrite the equation as:

2^(x-2) = a(a + 1)

The left-hand side is a power of 2, which means it is either 1 or an even number. Since a(a + 1) is the product of two consecutive integers, one of them must be even, and the other must be odd. Therefore, a(a + 1) can only be a power of 2 if one of the factors is 1 and the other is 2 (since any other even number will have a factor other than 2, making the product not a power of 2).

This means that a = 1 and a + 1 = 2, or vice versa. In either case, we get a = 1. Substituting back, we have:

3^k = 2a + 1
3^k = 2(1) + 1
3^k = 3

This implies that k = 1, and since y = 2k, we have y = 2. Now we can solve for x:

2^x + 1 = 3^y
2^x + 1 = 3^2
2^x + 1 = 9
2^x = 8
x = 3

So, the only solution for x ≥ 4 and even y is (x, y) = (3, 2), but this does not satisfy the condition x ≥ 4. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case for x ≥ 4.

**Conclusion:**

The only positive integer solution to the equation 2^x + 1 = 3^y is (x, y) = (3, 2), which we found by considering the case where x &lt; 4 and y is even. There are no solutions for x ≥ 4, whether y is odd or even.</code></pre>
