<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?
Step-wise solution:
1. We see that each odd-powered x term has a negative coefficient and each even-powered x term has a positive coefficient.
2. Thus, P(x)&gt;0 for x≤0.
3. For x&gt;0, we get x*P(x)=x^(2n+1)-2x^(2n)+3x^(2n-1)-4x^(2n-2)+...+(2n+1)x.
4. We have x*P(x)+P(x)=x^(2n+1)-x^(2n)+x^(2n-1)-x^(2n-2)+...+x+(2n+1)=x(1+x^(2n+1))/(1+x)+2n+1, which is positive for x&gt;0.
5. Thus, P(x)&gt;0 for x&gt;0.
6. So we have P(x)&gt;0 for all x, and the polynomial has no real root for any n.
7. So the answer is 0.

Problem: Factorize x^9+x^4-x-1 into terms of integer coefficients.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^9+x^4-x-1=(x^9-x)+(x^4-1)=x(x^8-1)+(x^4-1)=x(x^4+1)(x^4-1)+(x^4-1)=(x^4-1)(x^5+x+1)=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^5+x+1).
2. To factorize x^5+x+1, we have x^5+x+1=(x^5-x^2)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x^3-1)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x-1)(x^2+x+1)+(x^2+x+1)=(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).
3. Thus, x^9+x^4-x-1=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).

Problem: What are possible values of 20^n+16^n-3^n-1 mod 323 for even n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 323=17*19, we study 20^n+16^n-3^n-1 mod 17 and 20^n+16^n-3^n-1 mod 19.
2. For 17, we have 17 | 20^n-3^n.
3. Furthermore, for even n, we have 16^n-1=(-16)^n-1, which is divisible by -16-1=-17, and hence 17.
4. Thus, 17 | 20^n+16^n-3^n-1.
5. For 19, we have 19 | 20^n-1 because 19 | 20^n-1^n.
6. Furthermore, for even n, we have 16^n-3^n=(-16)^n-3^n, which is divisible by -16-3=-19 and hence 19.
7. Thus, 19 | 20^n+16^n-3^n-1.
8. Combining the above two results, we have 323 | 20^n+16^n-3^n-1 and 20^n+16^n-3^n-1 mod 323=0.

Problem: Can n+2 be a factor of 1^1987+2^1987+...+n^1987 for some n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let s=1^1987+2^1987+...+n^1987.
2. Thus, 2s=1^1987+2^1987+...+n^1987+1^1987+2^1987+...+n^1987=2+(2^1987+n^1987)+(3^1987+(n-1)^1987)+...+((n-1)^1987+3^1987)+(n^1987+2^1987).
3. We have 2s=2+t where t=(2^1987+n^1987)+(3^1987+(n-1)^1987)+...+((n-1)^1987+3^1987)+(n^1987+2^1987).
4. We know 2+n | 2^1987+n^1987, 3+n-1 | 3^1987+(n-1)^1987...
5. Thus, 2+n divides each term in t, so 2+n | t.
6. This means 2+n ∤ 2s so 2+n ∤ s.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Are there prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). If so, what is the smallest one?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. 10001=73*137.
2. For even n, let n+1=m and factorize the expression for a_n.
3. For odd n, let n+1=2k and factorize the expression for a_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if there are prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ..., we need to analyze the pattern of the numbers and see if they can be factorized.

Given the hint that 10001 = 73 * 137, we can see that a_1 is not prime. Now, let&#x27;s look at the structure of the numbers in the sequence. Each number a_n is formed by a pattern of 1s separated by blocks of three 0s. We can write a_n as:

a_n = 1 + 10^4 + 10^8 + ... + 10^(4n)

This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 10^4. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is given by:

S_n = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

For our sequence, this becomes:

a_n = (1 - (10^4)^n) / (1 - 10^4)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the cases for even and odd n separately, as suggested.

For even n:
Let n + 1 = m, which means n = m - 1 and n is even. We can rewrite a_n as:

a_n = (1 - (10^4)^(m-1)) / (1 - 10^4)

Notice that (10^4)^(m-1) is a perfect square since m-1 is odd (because n is even). This means that a_n can be written as a difference of squares:

a_n = ((10^2)^(m-1) - 1) * ((10^2)^(m-1) + 1) / (10^4 - 1)

Since 10^4 - 1 = 9999 = 3^2 * 11 * 101, we can see that a_n is not prime for even n because it has at least two factors.

For odd n:
Let n + 1 = 2k, which means n = 2k - 1 and n is odd. We can rewrite a_n as:

a_n = (1 - (10^4)^(2k-1)) / (1 - 10^4)

Here, (10^4)^(2k-1) is not a perfect square, but we can still factor it using the difference of squares method by pairing terms:

a_n = (1 - 10^4 + 10^8 - ... + 10^(4(2k-2)) - 10^(4(2k-1))) / (1 - 10^4)

This expression is more complex to factorize directly, but we can observe that for k &gt; 1, the number will have more than one term and thus will not be prime.

Since we have already established that a_1 is not prime and that a_n is not prime for even n, we only need to check the odd n terms for n &gt; 1. However, the structure of the sequence suggests that for odd n &gt; 1, the number will also not be prime due to the presence of multiple terms in the sum.

Therefore, there are no prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} for n &gt; 1. The sequence starts with a composite number a_1 = 10001, and the structure of the sequence implies that all subsequent terms will also be composite.</code></pre>
