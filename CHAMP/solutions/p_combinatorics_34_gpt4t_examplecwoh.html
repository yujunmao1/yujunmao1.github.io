<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider an example where you have free time during the weekend and you want to choose an activity to do on Saturday. You have several options, but you can only do one activity due to time constraints.

Action 1: Watch a movie.
- You have 3 movies you&#x27;re interested in watching.

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.

Action 2: Read a book.
- You have 2 new books to choose from.

There are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.

Action 3: Go for a hike.
- There are 4 different trails nearby.

There are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

Action 4: Visit a friend.
- You have 5 friends you could potentially visit.

There are p_4 = 5 ways to perform the fourth action.

Since you can only choose one activity to do on Saturday, the total number of ways you can spend your time is the sum of the ways to perform each individual action:

Total number of ways to spend Saturday = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4
                                        = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5
                                        = 14

So, there are 14 different ways you could choose to spend your Saturday, given these activity options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider how many times the number k can appear in sequences of positive integers that sum up to n.

Let&#x27;s break down the problem:

1. We want to find the number of sequences where the sum is n and the number k appears at least once.
2. Since k &lt; n - 1, there is at least one other number in the sequence.
3. We can think of the problem as first placing k and then finding the number of ways to distribute the remaining n - k among the other numbers in the sequence.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sequence as a composition of n, where we have n - 1 &quot;slots&quot; between the numbers to potentially place &quot;dividers&quot; that separate the numbers in the sequence. For example, if n = 5, the sequence 1 + 1 + 3 can be represented as:

1 | 1 | 3

Here, we have 4 slots and 2 dividers.

When we place k in the sequence, we are left with n - k to distribute. We need to count the number of compositions of n - k, which is equivalent to placing dividers in the remaining n - k - 1 slots (since k takes up one of the original slots).

The number of compositions of n - k is the same as the number of ways to place dividers in these slots, which is given by the binomial coefficient:

C(n - k - 1, r - 1)

where r is the number of parts in the composition. However, since we don&#x27;t have a fixed number of parts, we need to sum over all possible values of r, from 1 to n - k (since we can&#x27;t have more parts than the number we&#x27;re trying to sum up to).

So, the total number of times k appears in sequences summing to n is the sum of the binomial coefficients for all possible values of r:

Sum(C(n - k - 1, r - 1)) for r = 1 to n - k

This sum is actually a well-known identity in combinatorics, which states that the sum of binomial coefficients in this manner equals 2 raised to the power of the upper index:

Sum(C(n - k - 1, r - 1)) = 2^(n - k - 1)

Therefore, the number of times the number k appears in sequences of positive integers that sum to n is:

2^(n - k - 1)

This is the final answer, expressed in terms of n and k.</code></pre>
