<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. How many diagonals are there in a convex polygon of n vertices, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have C(n, 2) vertex pairs, and n of them are between adjacent vertices.
2. Thus, we have C(n, 2)-n=n(n-1)/2-n=n(n-3)/2 diagonals.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations.

Let&#x27;s consider the scenario where each dog gets at least one cookie. In this case, we can distribute the cookies among the dogs in the following ways:

1. One dog gets all three cookies: There are 8 ways to choose the dog that gets all three cookies.

2. Two dogs get two cookies each: There are C(8, 2) ways to choose the two dogs that get two cookies each. Once the dogs are chosen, there are C(3, 2) ways to distribute the two cookies among them.

3. Three dogs get one cookie each: There are C(8, 3) ways to choose the three dogs that get one cookie each. Once the dogs are chosen, there are 3! ways to distribute the three cookies among them.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the scenario where one or more dogs do not get any cookies. In this case, we can distribute the cookies among the dogs in the following ways:

1. One dog gets two cookies, and two dogs get none: There are 8 ways to choose the dog that gets two cookies. Once the dog is chosen, there are C(7, 2) ways to choose the two dogs that get none.

2. Two dogs get one cookie each, and two dogs get none: There are C(8, 2) ways to choose the two dogs that get one cookie each. Once the dogs are chosen, there are C(6, 2) ways to choose the two dogs that get none.

3. Three dogs get one cookie each, and one dog gets none: There are C(8, 3) ways to choose the three dogs that get one cookie each. Once the dogs are chosen, there are C(5, 1) ways to choose the dog that gets none.

Adding up all the possibilities, we get:

Total number of possible results = (1 + C(8, 2) * C(3, 2) + C(8, 3) * 3!) + (8 * C(7, 2) + C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) + C(8, 3) * C(5, 1))

Calculating this expression will give us the final answer.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The total number of possible results for distributing 3 cookies among 8 dogs, where each dog can get more than one cookie or no cookies, is given by (1 + C(8, 2) * C(3, 2) + C(8, 3) * 3!) + (8 * C(7, 2) + C(8, 2) * C(6, 2) + C(8, 3) * C(5, 1)).</code></pre>
