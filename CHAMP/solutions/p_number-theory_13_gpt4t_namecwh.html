<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
In other words, you can add the remainders of two numbers and the sum will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
Similar to addition, you can subtract the remainders of two numbers and the difference will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
When you multiply two numbers, you can multiply their remainders to get the remainder of the product when divided by the modulus.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You cannot simply divide the remainders unless the number you are dividing by is coprime with the modulus (they share no common divisors other than 1). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), and c has a multiplicative inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / d) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
You can raise both sides of a congruence to a power, and the result will be congruent modulo n.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have modular inverses; an integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory, as well as in practical applications such as calculating the day of the week for a given date. It simplifies arithmetic for large numbers by dealing with their remainders and has properties that are useful in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Find the possible last digit of |36^m-5^n|.
2. Determine if |36^m-5^n| can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
3. Determine |36^m-5^n| can be 9 for any m, n by considering the expression modulo 6.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the last digits of powers of 36 and 5, and then use modular arithmetic to analyze the possible values of |36^m - 5^n|.

1. Last digit of powers of 36 and 5:
The last digit of any power of 36 will always be 6, because 36 ends in 6 and multiplying any number ending in 6 by another number ending in 6 will result in a number ending in 6.

The last digit of powers of 5 will always be 5, because 5 raised to any positive integer power will end in 5.

2. Can |36^m - 5^n| be 1?
If |36^m - 5^n| = 1, then we have two cases to consider:
- 36^m - 5^n = 1
- 5^n - 36^m = 1

For the first case, 36^m - 5^n = 1, we can see that this is not possible because 36^m will always end in 6 and 5^n will always end in 5, so their difference cannot end in 1.

For the second case, 5^n - 36^m = 1, this would imply that 5^n is just one more than a number ending in 6, which is not possible because 5^n always ends in 5.

Therefore, |36^m - 5^n| cannot be 1.

3. Can |36^m - 5^n| be 9?
We will consider the expression modulo 6 to see if |36^m - 5^n| can be 9.

Since 36 is a multiple of 6, 36^m (mod 6) is 0 for any positive integer m.

Now, let&#x27;s consider 5^n (mod 6). Since 5 is one less than 6, 5^n (mod 6) will always be 5, regardless of the value of n, because 5 is relatively prime to 6 and Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem tells us that 5^(6-1) ≡ 1 (mod 6), so 5^n ≡ 5 (mod 6) for any positive integer n.

Now, we want to see if the difference can be 9. Since 36^m is 0 modulo 6, the difference |36^m - 5^n| modulo 6 will just be the negative of 5^n modulo 6, which is -5. However, in modular arithmetic, we can add the modulus to get a positive representative, so -5 ≡ 1 (mod 6).

Therefore, |36^m - 5^n| cannot be 9 because its remainder when divided by 6 is 1, not 3 (which would be the remainder if the difference were 9).

Conclusion:
Since |36^m - 5^n| cannot be 1 or 9, we need to consider other possible values. The next smallest value after 1 and 9 is 11, which is possible if 36^m ends in 6 and 5^n ends in 5, and the tens digit of 36^m is one less than the tens digit of 5^n. However, without further constraints on m and n, we cannot definitively say that 11 is the smallest value, but it is the smallest we can conclude based on the given information and the analysis above.</code></pre>
