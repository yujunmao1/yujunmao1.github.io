<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find the four-digit number abcd such that 4*abcd=dcba.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have dcba=4*abcd, which means that a is 1 or 2, since 3000*4=12000 is a five-digit number.
2. Since dcba is also even, we have a=2.
3. So 2bcd*4=dcb2 and d must be 8 since we need dâ‰¥2*4 and d*4 ends with 2.
4. So we have 2bc8*4=8cb2.
5. We also know that b2 must be divisible by 4, which means that b is 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9.
6. We have 2300*4=9200 which contradicts d=8.
7. Thus, b=1, and we have 21c8*4=8c12.
8. We have 4(2108+10c)=8012+100c, which gives us c=7.
9. Thus, the number is 2178.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

2. Find the values of c and d together by setting up an equation of the multiplicative relationship.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s solve the problem step by step:

1. Since we are looking for a five-digit number abcde such that 4*abcde=edcba, we know that a cannot be greater than 2 because 4 times any number starting with 3 or greater would result in a six-digit number. Therefore, a is either 1 or 2.

2. Since edcba is a multiple of 4, e must be even. Therefore, e can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. However, since abcde is a five-digit number, e cannot be 0. So e can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.

3. If a is 1, then e must be 4 because 4 times any number starting with 1 would not be enough to make the last digit of the product 8 or 6 (since 4*10000=40000 and 4*19999=79996). If a is 2, then e must be 8 because 4 times any number starting with 2 would not be enough to make the last digit of the product 2, 4, or 6 (since 4*20000=80000 and 4*29999=119996). Therefore, a=2 and e=8.

4. Now we have 2bcde*4=edcb8. Since edcb8 is a multiple of 4, cb must be a multiple of 4. Since b is a single digit, b can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. However, since abcde is a five-digit number, b cannot be 0. So b can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

5. Let&#x27;s find the values of c and d together. We have the equation:

4*(20000 + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*d + e) = 10000*e + 1000*d + 100*c + 10*b + 8

Substituting e=8 and a=2, we get:

4*(20000 + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*d + 8) = 80000 + 1000*d + 100*c + 10*b + 8

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

80000 + 4000*b + 400*c + 40*d + 32 = 80000 + 1000*d + 100*c + 10*b + 8

Now, let&#x27;s subtract 80000 from both sides:

4000*b + 400*c + 40*d + 32 = 1000*d + 100*c + 10*b + 8

Grouping terms with the same variables together and moving them to one side, we get:

3990*b + 300*c - 960*d + 24 = 0

Since b, c, and d are digits, we can try different values for b and see which one gives us integer values for c and d that satisfy the equation. We can start with the smallest possible value for b, which is 1, and increase it until we find a solution.

Let&#x27;s try b=1:

3990*1 + 300*c - 960*d + 24 = 0
3990 + 300*c - 960*d + 24 = 0
4014 + 300*c - 960*d = 0

Now, we need to find values of c and d that satisfy this equation. We can do this by trial and error, keeping in mind that c and d must be digits (0-9).

Let&#x27;s try d=4 (since 960*4 ends with a 4, which is necessary to cancel out the 4 in 4014):

4014 + 300*c - 960*4 = 0
4014 + 300*c - 3840 = 0
174 + 300*c = 0

This equation cannot be true since 174 is not divisible by 300. So, d cannot be 4. Let&#x27;s try d=3:

4014 + 300*c - 960*3 = 0
4014 + 300*c - 2880 = 0
1134 + 300*c = 0

Now, we need to find a value for c such that 1134 + 300*c is a multiple of 960. Since 1134 is not a multiple of 300, there is no integer value for c that will satisfy this equation. So, d cannot be 3 either.

Let&#x27;s try d=2:

4014 + 300*c - 960*2 = 0
4014 + 300*c - 1920 = 0
2094 + 300*c = 0

This equation cannot be true since 2094 is not divisible by 300. So, d cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try d=1:

4014 + 300*c - 960*1 = 0
4014 + 300*c - 960 = 0
3054 + 300*c = 0

Now, we need to find a value for c such that 3054 + 300*c is a multiple of 960. Since 3054 is not a multiple of 300, there is no integer value for c that will satisfy this equation. So, d cannot be 1.

Let&#x27;s try d=0:

4014 + 300*c - 960*0 = 0
4014 + 300*c = 0

This equation cannot be true since 4014 is not divisible by 300. So, d cannot be 0.

Since none of the values for d worked with b=1, we need to try a different value for b. We can continue this process, trying different values for b and d until we find a combination that works. However, this process is quite tedious and error-prone, so let&#x27;s try a different approach.

We know that 4*(2bcde) = edcb8, and we have already determined that a=2 and e=8. Let&#x27;s look at the last digit of the product 4*(2bcde). Since e=8, the last digit of the product must be 2 (because 4*8=32). This means that the last digit of 2bcde must be 3 (since 4*3=12).

Now we have 2bcd3*4 = 3dcb8. Let&#x27;s look at the tens place. The tens digit of the product must be 1 (since we carry over 1 from 4*3=12). This means that 4*d must end with a 1. The only single-digit number that satisfies this is d=3 (since 4*3=12).

Now we have 2bc33*4 = 33cb8. Let&#x27;s look at the hundreds place. The hundreds digit of the product must be 3 (since we carry over 1 from 4*3=12). This means that 4*c must end with a 3. The only single-digit number that satisfies this is c=8 (since 4*8=32).

Now we have 2b833*4 = 338b8. Let&#x27;s look at the thousands place. The thousands digit of the product must be 3 (since we carry over 3 from 4*8=32). This means that 4*b must end with a 3. The only single-digit number that satisfies this is b=4 (since 4*4=16).

Now we have 24833*4 = 33848. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

4*24833 = 99332

This is not correct, as the last digit should be 8, not 2. We made a mistake in our assumption that 4*b must end with a 3. Instead, we should consider the carry from the multiplication of c. Since c=8 and 4*8=32, we carry over 3 to the next multiplication. Therefore, we need 4*b + 3 to end with a 3. The only single-digit number that satisfies this is b=5 (since 4*5=20 and 20+3=23).

Now we have 25833*4 = 33852. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

4*25833 = 103332

This is correct, as the last digit is 2, and the carryover from the hundreds place (3 from 4*8=32) to the thousands place gives us 4*5+3=23, which ends with a 3 as required.

Therefore, the five-digit number abcde such that 4*abcde=edcba is 25833.</code></pre>
