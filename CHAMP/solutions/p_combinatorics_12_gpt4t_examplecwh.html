<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of circular permutations and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#x27;s go through the steps to solve the problem.

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By doing this, we are creating a circular arrangement where the condition for every driver to park is that there is no sequence of n consecutive lots starting from any point that are all occupied.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

The condition is that there must be at least one free lot in any sequence of n consecutive lots on the circular lot. This ensures that as each car drives around the circle, it will eventually find a free spot before completing a full loop.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

There are (n+1)^n total sequences of length n with values from 1 to n+1. However, not all of these sequences will satisfy the condition. We need to exclude sequences where all n consecutive lots are occupied.

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Each sequence of preferences {a_1, ..., a_n} has exactly n cyclic permutations (including the sequence itself). Since we are considering a circular arrangement, each of these permutations corresponds to a different starting point on the circle.

Now, we need to count the number of sequences where at least one lot is free in any sequence of n consecutive lots. This is equivalent to counting the number of derangements of a sequence of length n, where no element appears in its original position (since a car cannot park in its preferred spot if it&#x27;s taken).

The number of derangements (also known as the subfactorial) of a sequence of length n is given by:

!n = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)

However, we need to adjust this formula because we are considering sequences of length n with values from 1 to n+1. We need to exclude cases where the (n+1)-th lot is chosen n times, which would violate the condition. There are n ways to choose which car takes the extra lot, and then (n-1)! ways to arrange the remaining cars.

So, the number of valid sequences is:

(n+1)^n - n * (n-1)!

Now, since each valid sequence has n cyclic permutations, and each set of cyclic permutations corresponds to exactly one valid parking configuration on the original street, we divide the total number of valid sequences by n to get the number of distinct parking configurations:

Total distinct parking configurations = [(n+1)^n - n * (n-1)!] / n

This is the final expression for the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park.</code></pre>
