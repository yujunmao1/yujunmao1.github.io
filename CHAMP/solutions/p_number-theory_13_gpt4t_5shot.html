Do there exist positive integers x, y such that x+y, x+2y and 2x+y are both squares?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let x+y=a^2, x+2y=b^2, 2x+y=c^2.
2. Thus, 3a^2=b^2+c^2.
3. Since u^2 mod 3âˆˆ{0, 1}, we must have b^2 mod 3=c^2 mod 3=0.
4. This means 3 | b and 3 | c.
5. Thus, for b=3v and c=3w, b^2 mod 9=c^2 mod 9=0.
6. So a^2 mod 3=0, and 3 | a.
7. Therefore, we can substitute a=3u, b=3v, c=3w into the equation and get 3u^2=v^2+w^2.
8. So if (a,b,c) satisfies the equation, (a/3, b/3, c/3) also satisfies the equation.
9. Thus, the only possible value for integer (a, b, c) is (0, 0, 0), but this contradicts with the fact that x, y are positive.
10. So there cannot exist such x, y.</code></pre>

1. We have C(n, 2) vertex pairs, and n of them are between adjacent vertices.

1. We have a_n&lt;b_n for all n&gt;1.
2. In addition, we know that both a_(n+1) and b_(n+1) lie in between a_n and b_n, as they are averages.
3. Thus, we have a_n&lt;a_(n+1)&lt;b_(n+1)&lt;b_n.
4. So a_n is monotonically increasing and b_n is monotonically decreasing.
5. Thus, the ratio a_n/b_n is monotonically increasing.</code></pre>

1. Let the sequence be a_1, a_2, a_3, ....
2. Thus, a_1=10001=73*137.
3. For even n, let n+1=m.
4. We have a_n=1+10^4+10^8+...+10^(4n)=(10^(4m)-1)/(10^4-1)=(10^(2m)+1)(10^(2m)-1)/((10^2+1)(10^2-1))=((100^m+1)/(100+1))*((100^m-1)/(100-1)).
5. Since m is odd, we have 100+1 | 100^m+1 and 100-1 | 100^m-1.
6. Thus, ((100^m+1)/(100+1))*((100^m-1)/(100-1)) gives factorization for even n.
7. For odd n&gt;1, let n+1=2k.
8. We have a_n=1+10^4+10^8+...+10^(4n)=(10^(8k)-1)/(10^4-1)=(10^(4k)-1)(10^(4k)+1)/(10^4-1)=(10000^k-1)/(10000-1)*(10000^k+1).
9. We have 10000-1 | 10000^k-1 for any integer k.
10. Thus, ((10000^k-1)/(10000-1))*(10000^k+1) gives a factorization for odd n.
11. So there are no prime numbers in the sequence.</code></pre>

What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of \( |36^m - 5^n| \) for positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we need to find the smallest difference between a power of 36 and a power of 5. Since 36 is a perfect square (6^2), we can rewrite \( 36^m \) as \( (6^2)^m = 6^{2m} \).

We are looking for the smallest positive difference, so we start by checking the smallest powers of 5 and 36:

For \( m = 1 \), \( 36^m = 36 \).
For \( n = 1 \), \( 5^n = 5 \).

The difference \( |36 - 5| = 31 \), which is not minimal as we can find smaller differences by trying other powers.

Let&#x27;s try a few more values:

For \( m = 2 \), \( 36^m = 36^2 = 1296 \).
For \( n = 2 \), \( 5^n = 5^2 = 25 \).

The difference \( |1296 - 25| = 1271 \), which is larger than 31.

We can notice that since 36 is a perfect square, its powers will always end in 6, and since 5 is the base of the other sequence, its powers will always end in 5. Therefore, the difference between a power of 36 and a power of 5 will always end in 1. This means that the smallest possible value for \( |36^m - 5^n| \) is 1.

Now, we need to find the smallest powers of 36 and 5 that are closest to each other. We can do this by trial and error or by using logarithms to estimate the powers.

Let&#x27;s try a few more values:

For \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 3 \), \( 36^m = 36 \) and \( 5^n = 5^3 = 125 \).
The difference \( |36 - 125| = 89 \), which is larger than 31.

For \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 4 \), \( 36^m = 1296 \) and \( 5^n = 5^4 = 625 \).
The difference \( |1296 - 625| = 671 \), which is larger than 31.

We can see that the powers of 5 are increasing much faster than the powers of 36. We need to find powers such that \( 36^m \) is just one more or one less than \( 5^n \).

Let&#x27;s try a few more values:

For \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 5 \), \( 36^m = 36^3 = 46656 \) and \( 5^n = 5^5 = 3125 \).
The difference \( |46656 - 3125| = 43531 \), which is larger than 31.

We can see that the difference is still quite large. We need to find powers that are closer together. We can use logarithms to estimate the values of \( m \) and \( n \) that will give us a difference of 1.

Let&#x27;s assume that \( 36^m \) is just one more than \( 5^n \), i.e., \( 36^m = 5^n + 1 \).

Taking logarithms to the base 10 of both sides, we get:
\( m \log 36 = n \log 5 + \log 1 \)

Since \( \log 1 = 0 \), we have:
\( m \log 36 = n \log 5 \)

Now we can try to find integers \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation approximately. We can use a calculator to find the values of \( \log 36 \) and \( \log 5 \), and then find a ratio of \( m \) to \( n \) that makes the two sides of the equation nearly equal.

However, we can also notice that \( 36 = 6^2 \) and \( 6 = 5 + 1 \), so we can look for powers of 6 that are close to powers of 5, plus 1.

For example, \( 6^1 = 5 + 1 \), but \( 6^2 = 36 \) is not equal to \( 5^2 + 1 \). We can try higher powers:

\( 6^3 = 216 \) and \( 5^3 = 125 \), the difference is \( |216 - 125| = 91 \), which is still large.

\( 6^4 = 1296 \) and \( 5^4 = 625 \), the difference is \( |1296 - 625| = 671 \), which is still large.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that we need a systematic way to find the smallest difference. One way to do this is to write a simple computer program to check the differences for increasing values of \( m \) and \( n \) until we find the smallest difference of 1.

However, we can also use a mathematical approach to find the solution. We can rewrite the equation \( 36^m = 5^n + 1 \) as \( (6^2)^m = 5^n + 1 \), which simplifies to \( 6^{2m} = 5^n + 1 \).

Now, we can look for a power of 6 that when squared is one more than a power of 5. We can try small values of \( m \) and \( n \) to find the solution.

Let&#x27;s try \( m = 1 \):
\( 6^{2(1)} = 6^2 = 36 \), which is not one more than a power of 5.

Let&#x27;s try \( m = 2 \):
\( 6^{2(2)} = 6^4 = 1296 \), which is not one more than a power of 5.

Let&#x27;s try \( m = 3 \):
\( 6^{2(3)} = 6^6 = 46656 \), which is not one more than a power of 5.

We can see that this process is not yielding a solution quickly. We need to find a power of 6 that is just one more than a power of 5. This is a difficult problem to solve without the aid of a computer or more advanced mathematical tools.

However, we can use the fact that \( 6^2 = 36 \) and \( 5^2 = 25 \) to notice that \( 6^2 - 5^2 = 11 \), which is relatively close. We can look for powers of 6 and 5 that have a similar relationship.

Let&#x27;s try \( m = 4 \):
\( 6^{2(4)} = 6^8 = 1679616 \), which is not one more than a power of 5.

Let&#x27;s try \( m = 5 \):
\( 6^{2(5)} = 6^{10} \), which is a very large number and not practical to compute by hand.

At this point, it&#x27;s clear that finding the smallest value of \( |36^m - 5^n| \) for positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is a non-trivial problem that may require computational assistance or a more advanced mathematical approach.

One possible approach is to consider the problem modulo a certain number to find a congruence that must be satisfied by \( 36^m \) and \( 5^n \). For example, we can consider the problem modulo 4, modulo 10, or modulo other numbers that might give us insight into the powers of 36 and 5.

However, without further information or computational tools, we cannot easily find the smallest value of \( |36^m - 5^n| \) for positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) by hand.</code></pre>
