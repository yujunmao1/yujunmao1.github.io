Find all integer solutions to the equation x^2-3y^2=17.

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. For any integer x, we have x^2 mod 3∈{0, 1}.
2. We further have 3y^2 mod 3=0 and 17 mod 3=2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 17, we can use the information provided in the partial solution.

First, let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo 3:

x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 17 (mod 3)

Using the facts from the partial solution:

1. x^2 mod 3 ∈ {0, 1}
2. 3y^2 mod 3 = 0
3. 17 mod 3 = 2

We can simplify the equation modulo 3:

x^2 ≡ 2 (mod 3)

Since x^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1, and we need it to be congruent to 2 modulo 3, the only possibility is that x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3). This means that x must be of the form 3k + 1 or 3k + 2 for some integer k, because (3k)^2 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and (3k + 1)^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3) and (3k + 2)^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3).

Now, let&#x27;s look at the original equation:

x^2 - 3y^2 = 17

If x = 3k + 1, then:

(3k + 1)^2 - 3y^2 = 17
9k^2 + 6k + 1 - 3y^2 = 17
9k^2 + 6k - 3y^2 = 16
3(3k^2 + 2k - y^2) = 16

This is impossible because the left side is divisible by 3, but the right side is not.

If x = 3k + 2, then:

(3k + 2)^2 - 3y^2 = 17
9k^2 + 12k + 4 - 3y^2 = 17
9k^2 + 12k - 3y^2 = 13
3(3k^2 + 4k - y^2) = 13

Again, this is impossible because the left side is divisible by 3, but the right side is not.

Therefore, there are no integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 when considering the equation modulo 3. However, we made an error in our reasoning. We should not have concluded that there are no integer solutions based on the modulo 3 argument alone. Let&#x27;s correct this and find the actual integer solutions.

We know that x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), so x must be of the form 3k + 1 or 3k + 2. Let&#x27;s try to find solutions by testing small values of x and checking if they yield integer values for y.

For x = 1 (which is 3*0 + 1), we have:

1^2 - 3y^2 = 17
1 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = 16
y^2 = -16/3

This does not yield an integer solution for y.

For x = 2 (which is 3*0 + 2), we have:

2^2 - 3y^2 = 17
4 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = 13

This does not yield an integer solution for y either.

Let&#x27;s try x = 4 (which is 3*1 + 1):

4^2 - 3y^2 = 17
16 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = 1
y^2 = -1/3

Again, no integer solution for y.

Now, let&#x27;s try x = 5 (which is 3*1 + 2):

5^2 - 3y^2 = 17
25 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = -8
y^2 = 8/3

No integer solution for y here either.

Continuing this process, we eventually try x = 8 (which is 3*2 + 2):

8^2 - 3y^2 = 17
64 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = 17 - 64
-3y^2 = -47
y^2 = 47/3

This does not yield an integer solution for y.

However, if we try x = 7 (which is 3*2 + 1):

7^2 - 3y^2 = 17
49 - 3y^2 = 17
-3y^2 = 17 - 49
-3y^2 = -32
y^2 = 32/3
y^2 = 10.666...

This does not yield an integer solution for y either.

We need to find values of x and y that satisfy the equation and are integers. Let&#x27;s try a systematic approach by squaring different integers and checking if they fit the equation.

We are looking for x^2 = 3y^2 + 17. Since x^2 is always non-negative, we need to find squares that are 17 more than a multiple of 3. Let&#x27;s list some squares and see if any fit this pattern:

1^2 = 1
2^2 = 4
3^2 = 9
4^2 = 16
5^2 = 25
6^2 = 36
7^2 = 49
8^2 = 64
9^2 = 81
10^2 = 100
...

We are looking for a square that when we subtract 17, we get a multiple of 3. Let&#x27;s check these:

1 - 17 = -16 (not a multiple of 3)
4 - 17 = -13 (not a multiple of 3)
9 - 17 = -8 (not a multiple of 3)
16 - 17 = -1 (not a multiple of 3)
25 - 17 = 8 (not a multiple of 3)
36 - 17 = 19 (not a multiple of 3)
49 - 17 = 32 (not a multiple of 3)
64 - 17 = 47 (not a multiple of 3)
81 - 17 = 64 (a multiple of 3)
100 - 17 = 83 (not a multiple of 3)
...

We see that 81 - 17 = 64, which is a multiple of 3. In fact, it is 3 times 21. So we have:

x^2 = 81
y^2 = 21

Taking square roots (and considering both positive and negative possibilities for y):

x = ±9
y = ±√21

Since √21 is not an integer, we discard this solution. We need to continue our search for squares that are 17 more than a multiple of 3. Let&#x27;s continue:

11^2 = 121
12^2 = 144
13^2 = 169
...

Checking these:

121 - 17 = 104 (not a multiple of 3)
144 - 17 = 127 (not a multiple of 3)
169 - 17 = 152 (not a multiple of 3)
...

We continue this process until we find a square that works. After some trial and error, we find:

8^2 = 64
64 - 17 = 47 (not a multiple of 3)

But if we try:

5^2 = 25
25 - 17 = 8 (which is 3 times 2^2)

So we have:

x^2 = 25
y^2 = 8/3

This does not yield an integer solution for y. We made a mistake here; we should have checked if 8 is a perfect square, which it is not. Let&#x27;s correct this and continue searching.

Continuing with the squares:

14^2 = 196
196 - 17 = 179 (not a multiple of 3)
15^2 = 225
225 - 17 = 208 (not a multiple of 3)
16^2 = 256
256 - 17 = 239 (not a multiple of 3)
17^2 = 289
289 - 17 = 272 (not a multiple of 3)
18^2 = 324
324 - 17 = 307 (not a multiple of 3)
19^2 = 361
361 - 17 = 344 (which is 3 times 114, but 114 is not a perfect square)
