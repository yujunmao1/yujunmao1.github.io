<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: 8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?
Step-wise solution:
1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white.
2. We can derive 8 numbers, being the numbers of white dots to the left of the first black dot, in between each black dots, and to the right of the last black dot.
3. Obviously each number is non-negative and all numbers sum up to 3.
4. Thus, we can consider this as one possible result of the fight.
5. Furthermore, each fight result can also be encoded as a dot configuration.
6. So there are C(10, 7)=C(10, 3)=120 possible results.

Problem: A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?
Step-wise solution:
1. Since we are only interested in the probability of no-adjacent-apple-tree configuration, we do not need to distinguish among the 3 apple trees, nor do we need to distinguish among the 5 other threes.
2. We consider a row of 5 dots, representing the 5 other trees.
3. We can place 3 dividers into 6 locations (1 on each side and 4 in the middle), which corresponds to a unique configuration of planting 3 apple trees among 5 other trees, with no adjacent apple trees.
4. We have C(6, 3)=20 ways to do it.
5. To calculate the total number of ways of planting 3 apple trees and 5 other trees, we select 3 locations among 8 slots, with C(8, 3) ways to do it.
6. Thus, the probability is C(6, 3)/C(8, 3)=20/(8*7*6/(3*2*1))=5*4*3*2*1/(8*7*6)=5/14.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider the subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} and define a mapping f from these subsets to the subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element (e.g., f({0, 2, 3, 5})={2, 3, 5}).
2. For f(x)=y, where x and y are the two subsets, how many x map to the same y?
3. Relate the number of all possible x to the sum of the smallest element of all possible y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of size r from the set {1, 2, ..., n}.

Let&#x27;s denote the set {1, 2, ..., n} as S. The total number of subsets of size r from S is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, r).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the smallest element in each subset. If the smallest element is 1, then we have C(n-1, r-1) ways to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the set {2, 3, ..., n}. If the smallest element is 2, then we have C(n-2, r-1) ways to choose the remaining r-1 elements from the set {3, 4, ..., n}, and so on, up to the smallest element being n-r+1, where we have C(n-(n-r+1), r-1) = C(r-1, r-1) = 1 way to choose the remaining r-1 elements.

The sum of the smallest elements, multiplied by the number of subsets they appear in as the smallest element, is then:

Sum = 1 * C(n-1, r-1) + 2 * C(n-2, r-1) + ... + (n-r+1) * C(r-1, r-1)

To find the arithmetic mean, we divide this sum by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r):

Arithmetic Mean = Sum / C(n, r)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the mapping f from the problem hint. For each subset y of size r from the set {1, ..., n}, there is exactly one subset x of size r+1 from the set {0, 1, ..., n} that maps to y by removing the smallest element. This means that the number of all possible x is the same as the number of all possible y, which is C(n, r).

The sum of the smallest element of all possible y is then equal to the sum of the second smallest element of all possible x (since the smallest element of x is always 0). This sum is the same as the sum we calculated above.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the sum using the linearity of expectation. The expected value of the smallest element in a subset of size r is the same as the average value of the smallest element over all possible subsets of size r.

For each element i in the set S, the probability that it is the smallest element in a subset of size r is the number of subsets of size r-1 from the remaining n-i elements, divided by the total number of subsets of size r:

P(i is the smallest) = C(n-i, r-1) / C(n, r)

The expected value of the smallest element is then the sum of each element multiplied by its probability of being the smallest:

E(smallest element) = Σ (i * P(i is the smallest)) for i from 1 to n-r+1

E(smallest element) = Σ (i * C(n-i, r-1) / C(n, r)) for i from 1 to n-r+1

This expected value is the arithmetic mean we are looking for. To simplify this expression, we can use properties of binomial coefficients. However, the simplification is not straightforward and requires careful manipulation of the summation and binomial coefficients. The final expression will be a function of n and r, but deriving it requires a deeper analysis of the binomial properties and summation techniques, which may involve combinatorial identities or generating functions.</code></pre>
