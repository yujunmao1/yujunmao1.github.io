<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let H(n, r) represent the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups (where horses in each group are tied).
2. We have H(n, 1)=1 for all n, since there is only one way that all groups are tied.
3. To calculate H(n, r), we add a new horse to the race result of n-1 horses.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations. 

Let&#x27;s consider the case where there are 4 horses and 1 group. In this case, there is only one way for all horses to finish, which is a tie. So, H(4, 1) = 1.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case where there are 4 horses and 2 groups. We can think of this as dividing the horses into two groups, where each group can have any number of horses (including 0). 

To calculate H(4, 2), we can consider the possibilities for the first group. It can have 0 horses, 1 horse, 2 horses, 3 horses, or all 4 horses. For each of these possibilities, the second group will have the remaining horses.

If the first group has 0 horses, then the second group will have all 4 horses. This can be represented as (0, 4).

If the first group has 1 horse, then the second group will have the remaining 3 horses. This can be represented as (1, 3).

If the first group has 2 horses, then the second group will have the remaining 2 horses. This can be represented as (2, 2).

If the first group has 3 horses, then the second group will have the remaining 1 horse. This can be represented as (3, 1).

If the first group has all 4 horses, then the second group will have 0 horses. This can be represented as (4, 0).

So, for H(4, 2), there are 5 possible ways for the horses to finish.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case where there are 4 horses and 3 groups. We can think of this as dividing the horses into three groups, where each group can have any number of horses (including 0).

To calculate H(4, 3), we can consider the possibilities for the first group. It can have 0 horses, 1 horse, 2 horses, 3 horses, or all 4 horses. For each of these possibilities, we can consider the possibilities for the second group, which can have any number of horses (including 0), and the remaining horses will be in the third group.

If the first group has 0 horses, then the second group can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 horses. For each of these possibilities, the third group will have the remaining horses.

If the first group has 1 horse, then the second group can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 horses. For each of these possibilities, the third group will have the remaining horses.

If the first group has 2 horses, then the second group can have 0, 1, or 2 horses. For each of these possibilities, the third group will have the remaining horses.

If the first group has 3 horses, then the second group can have 0 or 1 horse. For each of these possibilities, the third group will have the remaining horses.

If the first group has all 4 horses, then the second group will have 0 horses. The third group will also have 0 horses.

So, for H(4, 3), there are a total of 15 possible ways for the horses to finish.

In general, we can use the formula H(n, r) = (n+r-1)C(r-1), where C represents the combination function. 

Using this formula, we can calculate H(4, 4) = (4+4-1)C(4-1) = 7C3 = 7! / (3! * 4!) = 7.

Therefore, there are a total of 1 + 5 + 15 + 7 = 28 possible ways for the 4 horses to finish.</code></pre>
