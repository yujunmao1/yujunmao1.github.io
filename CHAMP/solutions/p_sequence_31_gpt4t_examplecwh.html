<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider two non-negative numbers, say 9 and 4. We will apply the concept to these numbers.

First, we take the square roots of both numbers:

sqrt(9) = 3
sqrt(4) = 2

Now, we compare the square roots:

3 (which is sqrt(9)) ≥ 2 (which is sqrt(4))

This inequality holds true. According to the concept, this should mean that the original numbers also satisfy the inequality:

9 ≥ 4

Since this is also true, the example confirms the concept that for non-negative x and y, sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y) if and only if x ≥ y.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. An example of such a sequence is the sequence of the reciprocals of the natural numbers, starting from some positive integer n:

a_n = 1/(n+1), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

This sequence can be written out as:

a_1 = 1/2, a_2 = 1/3, a_3 = 1/4, ..., a_n = 1/(n+1), ...

This sequence is monotonically increasing because as n gets larger, the denominator of the fraction gets larger, which means the value of the fraction gets smaller (since we&#x27;re dealing with positive numbers). Therefore, each term is less than or equal to the previous term:

a_n+1 ≤ a_n for all n.

The sequence is also bounded from above because all terms are less than or equal to the first term, which is 1/2. No term in the sequence will ever exceed 1/2, so we can say that the sequence is bounded above by 1/2.

According to the concept, since the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit of the sequence as n approaches infinity is 0. This is because as n becomes very large, the value of 1/(n+1) gets closer and closer to 0, but never negative or greater than 1/2. Thus, the limit of the sequence a_n = 1/(n+1) is:

lim (n→∞) a_n = 0

This example demonstrates the concept that a sequence which is monotonic and bounded has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What are possible values of the limit of the sequence a_n=sqrt(a_(n-1))+sqrt(a_(n-2)), for different initial values of 0&lt;a_0, a_1&lt;1, possibly as an expression of a_0, a_1?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the monotonicity and boundedness of the sequence for 0&lt;a_0≤a_1&lt;1.
2. Study the monotonicity and boundedness of the sequence for 0&lt;a_1&lt;a_0&lt;1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence \( a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \) for different initial values \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \). We will consider two cases based on the initial values: \( 0 &lt; a_0 \leq a_1 &lt; 1 \) and \( 0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_0 &lt; 1 \).

**Case 1: \( 0 &lt; a_0 \leq a_1 &lt; 1 \)**

Let&#x27;s first establish that the sequence is bounded. Since \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \), it follows that \( \sqrt{a_0}, \sqrt{a_1} &lt; 1 \). Therefore, for \( n \geq 2 \), we have:

\[ a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} &lt; 1 + 1 = 2 \]

So the sequence is bounded above by 2.

Next, we need to show that the sequence is monotonically increasing. We will prove this by induction. Since \( a_0 \leq a_1 \), we have:

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{a_1} + \sqrt{a_0} \geq \sqrt{a_0} + \sqrt{a_0} = 2\sqrt{a_0} &gt; a_1 \]

Assume that \( a_{n-1} \geq a_{n-2} \) for some \( n \geq 3 \). Then:

\[ a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \geq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} = 2\sqrt{a_{n-2}} \]

And since \( a_{n-1} \geq a_{n-2} \), it follows that \( \sqrt{a_{n-1}} \geq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \), so:

\[ a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \geq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} = a_{n-1} \]

Thus, by induction, the sequence is monotonically increasing.

Since the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. Let&#x27;s denote this limit as \( L \). Taking the limit on both sides of the recursive formula, we get:

\[ L = \sqrt{L} + \sqrt{L} \]

\[ L = 2\sqrt{L} \]

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[ L^2 = 4L \]

\[ L^2 - 4L = 0 \]

\[ L(L - 4) = 0 \]

Since \( L \) cannot be negative, we discard the solution \( L = 0 \) and are left with \( L = 4 \). However, this is not possible since \( L \) must be less than 2 (as the sequence is bounded above by 2). Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our assumption that \( L \) could be finite. The sequence does not converge to a finite limit in this case, as the terms keep increasing without bound.

**Case 2: \( 0 &lt; a_1 &lt; a_0 &lt; 1 \)**

The analysis for this case is similar to Case 1. We can show that the sequence is bounded above by 2, as before. However, the monotonicity is not guaranteed in this case because the initial conditions are reversed. We would need to analyze the behavior of the sequence further to determine if it is monotonically increasing or decreasing, which may depend on the specific values of \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \).

Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume that the sequence is monotonically increasing (the analysis for a monotonically decreasing sequence would be similar). If the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, then it must have a limit. We would again set up the equation for the limit \( L \) as before:

\[ L = 2\sqrt{L} \]

And we would arrive at the same contradiction, indicating that the sequence does not converge to a finite limit.

In conclusion, for both cases, the sequence \( a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \) with initial conditions \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \) does not seem to converge to a finite limit. The sequence is bounded above by 2, but the terms do not stabilize to a single value as \( n \) approaches infinity. The behavior of the sequence in terms of monotonicity and convergence may need to be analyzed further with more specific information about the initial values \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \).</code></pre>
