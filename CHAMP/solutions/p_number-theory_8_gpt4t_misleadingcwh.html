<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.
2. If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.
3. A perfect square number can only end in digit 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 and 9.
4. a^n-1=(a-1)(a^(n-1)+a^(n-2)+...+a+1).
5. For integer x, x^2 mod 9 can take values of 0, 1, 4 and 7.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1, we need to consider the properties of the numbers involved.

First, notice that (n-1), n, and (n+1) are three consecutive integers. Therefore, they are pairwise coprime, which means that any two of them have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1. This is because at most one of them can be even, and they cannot share any other prime factors since they are consecutive.

Since (n-1)n(n+1) is a product of three consecutive integers, we can consider it as a product of two coprime numbers, say b and c, where b = n-1 and c = n(n+1). Since b and c are coprime, if a^m is divisible by their product, then a^m must be divisible by each of them separately.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values of m. Since m &gt; 1, a^m is some power of a greater than a itself. This means that a^m could be a square (m=2), a cube (m=3), or some higher power of a.

Given that b and c are coprime, we can apply the second piece of information: if a | bc and gcd(b, c) = 1, then we can find integers m, n, p, q such that b = mp, c = nq, gcd(m, n) = gcd(p, q) = 1 and pq = a. This means that b and c must each be a power of a, and since they are consecutive integers, one of them must be a perfect power of a.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values of b and c. Since b = n-1 and c = n(n+1), we have a few cases to consider:

1. If b = n-1 is a power of a, then n-1 = a^k for some k. Since n is one more than a power of a, n cannot also be a power of a, so c = n(n+1) must be a power of a.

2. If c = n(n+1) is a power of a, then we have a similar situation. Since n and n+1 are consecutive, one of them must be a power of a, and the other must be one more than a power of a.

Now, let&#x27;s use the information about perfect squares. Since a perfect square number can only end in digit 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 9, we know that if b or c is a perfect square, it must end in one of these digits.

Let&#x27;s consider the modulo 9 values of squares. Since x^2 mod 9 can take values of 0, 1, 4, and 7, we know that if b or c is a square, then (n-1)^2 or (n(n+1))^2 mod 9 must be 0, 1, 4, or 7.

Now, let&#x27;s try to find solutions for n, a, and m. We need to find values of n such that (n-1)n(n+1) is a power of a. Since we are looking for integer solutions, we can start by considering small values of n and checking if (n-1)n(n+1) forms a power of a.

However, we can make a crucial observation: since n-1, n, and n+1 are three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. Therefore, the product (n-1)n(n+1) must be divisible by 3. Moreover, one of these numbers must be even, so the product is also divisible by 2. This means that the product is divisible by at least 6.

If we are looking for a^m, where m &gt; 1, then a must be at least 2 (since a &gt; 0). This means that the smallest possible value for a^m with m &gt; 1 is 2^2 = 4. However, since the product (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 6, a^m must also be divisible by 6 for some m &gt; 1. This means that a must be at least 6.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values of a and m. If a is a prime number, then a^m is a prime power, and since (n-1)n(n+1) is divisible by 6, a must be 2 or 3. However, if a is 2 or 3, then m must be such that 2^m or 3^m is divisible by 6, which is only possible if m is at least 2.

If a is not a prime number, then it must be a composite number that is a power of a prime. In this case, we need to find a prime p and an integer k such that a = p^k and (n-1)n(n+1) = (p^k)^m for some m &gt; 1.

Given these constraints, we can start by considering small values of n and checking if (n-1)n(n+1) forms a power of a prime number. We can also use the fact that a perfect square must end in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, or 9 to eliminate some possibilities.

Let&#x27;s start with n = 2. Then (n-1)n(n+1) = 1*2*3 = 6, which is not a power of a prime number. If we continue this process, we can check for each n whether (n-1)n(n+1) is a power of a prime number.

However, this process can be quite lengthy, and we need a more systematic way to find solutions. One approach is to consider the prime factorization of (n-1)n(n+1) and look for patterns that would indicate that it is a power of a prime number.

For example, if n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are odd, and one of them must be divisible by 3. If n is odd, then n is divisible by 3, and n-1 and n+1 are consecutive even numbers, one of which must be divisible by 4.

By considering these patterns and using the properties of perfect squares and prime powers, we can narrow down the possible values of n, a, and m and find solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m.

However, without further constraints on the values of n, a, and m, it is difficult to provide a complete solution to this problem. We would need additional information or a more specific question to find all possible solutions.</code></pre>
