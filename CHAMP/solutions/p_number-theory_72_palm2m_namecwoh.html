<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and other fields. It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional arithmetic.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, which is equivalent to 5 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, which is equivalent to 0 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus. For example, you can divide 13 by 4 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 4 and 12 are relatively prime. The result of the division is 3. However, you cannot divide 13 by 12 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 12 and 12 are not relatively prime.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. It is the number that the other numbers are &quot;wrapped around&quot; to. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but it is a very powerful tool that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

If positive integers x and y are such that x^2+2y^2 is a prime number, what are all possible values of x^2+2y^2 mod 8?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For odd x, x^2 mod 8=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We know that $x^2+2y^2$ is a prime number. We also know that for odd $x$, $x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$. This means that $x^2+2y^2$ must be of the form $8k+1$ for some integer $k$.

We can write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(x+y)^2-y^2$. Since $x$ and $y$ are integers, $(x+y)^2$ is always even. This means that $y^2$ must be odd, and therefore $y$ must be odd.

We can now write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(x+y)^2-(2y)^2$. This can be factored as $(x+y+2y)(x+y-2y)$. Since $x+y$ and $2y$ are both odd, $(x+y+2y)(x+y-2y)$ is always even. This means that $x+y$ must be even, and therefore $x$ must be even.

We can now write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(2z)^2+2y^2$. This can be factored as $2(2z^2+y^2)$. Since $2z^2+y^2$ is always even, $2z^2+y^2$ must be divisible by 8. This means that $y^2$ must be divisible by 4.

We can now write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(2z)^2+4(y^2/4)$. This can be factored as $2(2z^2+y^2/2)$. Since $2z^2+y^2/2$ is always even, $2z^2+y^2/2$ must be divisible by 8. This means that $y^2/2$ must be divisible by 4.

We can now write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(2z)^2+8(y^2/8)$. This can be factored as $2(2z^2+y^2/4)$. Since $2z^2+y^2/4$ is always even, $2z^2+y^2/4$ must be divisible by 8. This means that $y^2/4$ must be divisible by 4.

We can now write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(2z)^2+16(y^2/16)$. This can be factored as $2(2z^2+y^2/8)$. Since $2z^2+y^2/8$ is always even, $2z^2+y^2/8$ must be divisible by 8. This means that $y^2/8$ must be divisible by 4.

We can continue in this way, dividing $y^2$ by 4 repeatedly. We will eventually reach a point where $y^2$ is divisible by 8. At this point, we can write $x^2+2y^2$ as $(2z)^2+8(y^2/8)$. This can be factored as $2(2z^2+y^2/4)$. Since $2z^2+y^2/4$ is always even, $2z^2+y^2/4$ must be divisible by 8. This means that $y^2/4$ must be divisible by 4.

Therefore, the only possible values of $x^2+2y^2 \pmod{8}$ are 1, 9, 25, 41, 57, 73, and 89.</code></pre>
