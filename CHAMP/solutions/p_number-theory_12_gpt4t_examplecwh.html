If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all two-digit automorphic numbers besides 25.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the last two digit of a^2-a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all two-digit automorphic numbers besides 25, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last two digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a two-digit number \( 10x + y \), where \( x \) is the tens digit and \( y \) is the units digit.

The square of \( a \) is:
\[ (10x + y)^2 = 100x^2 + 20xy + y^2 \]

We are interested in the last two digits of \( a^2 \), which are affected by \( 20xy + y^2 \) since \( 100x^2 \) will contribute to the hundreds place and beyond.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the last two digits of \( a^2 - a \):
\[ a^2 - a = (10x + y)^2 - (10x + y) \]
\[ = 100x^2 + 20xy + y^2 - 10x - y \]
\[ = 100x^2 + 20xy - 10x + y^2 - y \]
\[ = 100x(x + 2y - 1) + y(y - 1) \]

Since we are only interested in the last two digits, we can ignore the term \( 100x(x + 2y - 1) \) because it is a multiple of 100 and does not affect the last two digits. We are left with:
\[ y(y - 1) \]

For \( a \) to be automorphic, \( a^2 - a \) must end in 00 because when we add \( a \) to \( a^2 - a \), we should get \( a^2 \) which ends in \( a \). This means \( y(y - 1) \) must be a multiple of 100.

Since \( y \) is a digit, it ranges from 0 to 9. We can check each value of \( y \) to see if \( y(y - 1) \) is a multiple of 100.

Let&#x27;s check each value of \( y \):
- For \( y = 0 \), \( y(y - 1) = 0 \times (-1) = 0 \), which is a multiple of 100, but this gives us a one-digit number.
- For \( y = 1 \), \( y(y - 1) = 1 \times 0 = 0 \), which is a multiple of 100, but this gives us a one-digit number.
- For \( y = 2 \), \( y(y - 1) = 2 \times 1 = 2 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 3 \), \( y(y - 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 4 \), \( y(y - 1) = 4 \times 3 = 12 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 5 \), \( y(y - 1) = 5 \times 4 = 20 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 6 \), \( y(y - 1) = 6 \times 5 = 30 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 7 \), \( y(y - 1) = 7 \times 6 = 42 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 8 \), \( y(y - 1) = 8 \times 7 = 56 \), which is not a multiple of 100.
- For \( y = 9 \), \( y(y - 1) = 9 \times 8 = 72 \), which is not a multiple of 100.

None of the values of \( y \) from 2 to 9 give us a multiple of 100 for \( y(y - 1) \), so there are no two-digit automorphic numbers where the units digit is from 2 to 9.

However, we have overlooked the fact that \( y(y - 1) \) must be congruent to 0 modulo 100, not necessarily equal to 100. This means we need to find \( y \) such that \( y(y - 1) \) ends with 00 when considered modulo 100.

Let&#x27;s reconsider the values of \( y \) with this in mind:
- For \( y = 5 \), \( y(y - 1) = 5 \times 4 = 20 \), and modulo 100, this is not ending in 00.
- For \( y = 6 \), \( y(y - 1) = 6 \times 5 = 30 \), and modulo 100, this is not ending in 00.
- For \( y = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \), we get a one-digit number, which we are not interested in.

We need to find a two-digit number \( a \) such that \( a^2 \) ends in \( a \). We know that \( a = 25 \) is one such number. Let&#x27;s try to find another by checking the squares of numbers ending in 5 or 6, as these are the most likely candidates to produce a result ending in the same last digit when squared.

- For \( a = 35 \), \( a^2 = 1225 \), which does not end in 35.
- For \( a = 45 \), \( a^2 = 2025 \), which does not end in 45.
- For \( a = 55 \), \( a^2 = 3025 \), which does not end in 55.
- For \( a = 65 \), \( a^2 = 4225 \), which does not end in 65.
- For \( a = 75 \), \( a^2 = 5625 \), which does not end in 75.
- For \( a = 85 \), \( a^2 = 7225 \), which does not end in 85.
- For \( a = 95 \), \( a^2 = 9025 \), which does not end in 95.

It seems that none of the numbers ending in 5, other than 25, are automorphic. Let&#x27;s check numbers ending in 6:

- For \( a = 76 \), \( a^2 = 5776 \), which ends in 76.

So, we have found another automorphic number: 76. Let&#x27;s check if there are any others:

- For \( a = 86 \), \( a^2 = 7396 \), which does not end in 86.
- For \( a = 96 \), \( a^2 = 9216 \), which ends in 16, not 96.

Therefore, the only two-digit automorphic numbers are 25 and 76.</code></pre>
