<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.

Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.

Suppose you have a box of 12 eggs. You count the eggs once and get a total of 12 counts. This means that you have counted each egg once. If you count the eggs again, you will get a total of 24 counts. This means that you have counted each egg twice. If you count the eggs a third time, you will get a total of 36 counts. This means that you have counted each egg three times. And so on.

In general, if you count each object d times, you will get a total of n counts, where n is the number of objects. So, if you have n objects and you count each object d times, you will get a total of n*d counts.

There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

However, some of these ways are not valid. For example, you cannot choose the same type of bread twice. So, we need to remove the invalid ways.

There are 3 ways to choose the bread, so there are 3 ways to choose the bread twice. There are 5 ways to choose the filling, so there are 5 ways to choose the filling twice. There are 2 ways to choose the condiments, so there are 2 ways to choose the condiments twice. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose two actions that cannot be performed at the same time.

We need to remove these 30 ways from the total number of ways to make a sandwich. So, the number of valid ways to make a sandwich is $300 - 30 = 270$.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 6 faces on a cube, and each face can be painted one of 6 colors. So, there are $6^6 = 46656$ ways to paint the cube. However, some of these colorings are equivalent up to rotations. For example, if we paint the faces of the cube red, green, blue, yellow, white, and black, then we can rotate the cube to get the same coloring with the colors in a different order. So, we need to remove these equivalent colorings from the total number of colorings.

To do this, we can use a group theory argument. The group of symmetries of a cube is $S_4$, the group of permutations of 4 objects. There are 24 elements in $S_4$, so there are 24 ways to rotate a cube.

We can now use the following argument to show that there are $6!$ distinct colorings of a cube up to rotations. Let $f(n)$ be the number of distinct colorings of a cube with $n$ colors. Then, we have the following recurrence relation:

$$f(n) = 6f(n-1)$$

This is because, for each coloring of a cube with $n-1$ colors, we can add a new color to any of the 6 faces of the cube to get a new coloring of a cube with $n$ colors.

The initial condition is $f(1) = 6$, since there is only one way to color a cube with one color.

Solving the recurrence relation, we get $f(n) = 6!$.

Therefore, there are $6!$ distinct colorings of a cube up to rotations.</code></pre>
