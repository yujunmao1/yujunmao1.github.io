<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree n and f(x)=x has no real number solutions. What is the maximum number of real number solutions does f(f(x))=x have?

You may find the following information useful:

1. A polynomial f(x) has no real-valued root if and only if f(x)&gt;0 for all x or f(x)&lt;0 for all x.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given that f(x) is a polynomial of degree n and f(x) = x has no real number solutions, we can infer that f(x) - x is also a polynomial of degree n (since the highest degree term in f(x) will be of degree n and the term in -x is of degree 1, the resulting polynomial after subtraction will still be of degree n).

Since f(x) = x has no real solutions, it means that f(x) - x is either always positive or always negative for all real x. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume f(x) - x &gt; 0 for all real x (the argument would be similar if we assumed f(x) - x &lt; 0).

Now, consider the composition f(f(x)). We want to find the number of solutions to f(f(x)) = x.

Let g(x) = f(f(x)) - x. We are looking for the number of real roots of g(x). Since f(x) is a polynomial of degree n, f(f(x)) is a polynomial where the degree is n raised to the power of n (because you&#x27;re applying an nth degree polynomial to another nth degree polynomial), so g(x) is also a polynomial of degree n^n.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the behavior of g(x) at extreme values of x:

1. As x approaches positive infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity (since f(x) - x &gt; 0, f(x) must grow faster than x). Therefore, f(f(x)) also approaches positive infinity. Hence, g(x) = f(f(x)) - x will approach positive infinity as well.

2. As x approaches negative infinity, the same argument applies. Since f(x) - x &gt; 0, f(x) is still greater than x, and as x goes to negative infinity, f(x) goes to negative infinity as well, but at a slower rate. Therefore, f(f(x)) will also approach negative infinity, and g(x) = f(f(x)) - x will approach negative infinity.

Given that g(x) is a polynomial of degree n^n, it will have at most n^n real roots by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, since g(x) approaches positive infinity as x approaches both positive and negative infinity, it means that g(x) must have at least one real root (by the Intermediate Value Theorem, since it must cross the x-axis at least once).

Now, we need to consider the behavior of g(x) between its roots. Since f(x) - x &gt; 0 for all x, f(x) is strictly increasing (because its derivative f&#x27;(x) - 1 is always positive). This implies that f(x) is a one-to-one function, and therefore, f(f(x)) is also one-to-one. A one-to-one function can only cross the x-axis once between any two of its points, which means that between any two roots of g(x), g(x) cannot have another root.

Therefore, the maximum number of real roots that g(x) can have is n^n, and the minimum is 1. Since we are looking for the maximum number of real roots, the answer is n^n.</code></pre>
