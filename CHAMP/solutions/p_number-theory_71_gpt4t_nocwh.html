What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
4. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
5. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
6. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
7. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
8. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer value of the expression |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. Let&#x27;s follow the steps outlined:

1. **Study if the expression can be 0.**
   The expression |12^m - 5^n| can only be 0 if 12^m = 5^n. Since 12 and 5 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions to this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. **Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.**
   Since 5 and 12 are coprime, their powers will also be coprime. Therefore, the difference between any power of 12 and any power of 5 cannot be 1. We can also quickly check small values of m and n to see if the difference is 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, since 12 - 5 = 7, and the difference will only grow larger with larger powers, we can conclude that the difference cannot be 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. **Determine if 12^m - 5^n can be 1.**
   For 12^m - 5^n to be 1, we would need 12^m = 5^n + 1. However, since 5^n is always odd, 5^n + 1 is always even, and 12^m is also always even, this equation could potentially have solutions. We need to express 5^n in terms of m and study its factors.

4. **To determine if 5^n - 12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.**
   If we consider the equation 5^n - 12^m = 1 (mod 3), we know that 5^n ≡ 2^n (mod 3) and 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3). For the equation to hold, we need 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 3), which happens when n is even. Therefore, n must be even for 5^n - 12^m to be 1.

5. **For even n, factor 5^n - 1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.**
   When n is even, 5^n - 1 can be factored using the difference of squares: 5^n - 1 = (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). Both factors must be even, and at least one of them must be divisible by 4.

6. **Recognize 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1.**
   Since 12^m = (2^2)^m * 3^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we need to distribute the prime factors 2 and 3 among the factors P = 5^(n/2) + 1 and Q = 5^(n/2) - 1. Since P and Q are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4, and the other can only be divisible by 2.

7. **Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.**
   Since P and Q differ by 2, they cannot both be divisible by 3. Therefore, one of them must contain all the factors of 3 from 12^m.

8. **Study possible solutions of the factor splitting.**
   We need to find the smallest m and n such that 2^(2m) * 3^m is split between P and Q. Since P - Q = 2, and P and Q are consecutive even numbers, we can start by trying small values of n (which must be even) and checking if the resulting P and Q can be factored into a form that matches 2^(2m) * 3^m.

Let&#x27;s try n = 2:
5^2 - 1 = 24 = 2^3 * 3
P = 5 + 1 = 6 = 2 * 3
Q = 5 - 1 = 4 = 2^2

Here, we have a match: 2^(2m) * 3^m = 2^3 * 3, which corresponds to m = 2 and n = 2. Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is |12^2 - 5^2| = |144 - 25| = |119| = 119.</code></pre>
