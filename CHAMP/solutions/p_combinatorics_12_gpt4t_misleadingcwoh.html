<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park. This is a combinatorial problem that can be approached by considering the properties of permutations and the specific constraints of the parking situation.

Let&#x27;s denote P(n) as the number of ways n drivers can park following the given rules. We will try to find a recursive relationship for P(n).

Consider the first driver. He has n choices for his favorite parking lot. Let&#x27;s say he picks parking lot k (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Now, we have two cases to consider:

1. If k = 1, the first parking lot is taken, and we have a subproblem with n-1 cars and n-1 parking lots. There are P(n-1) ways to park the remaining cars.

2. If k &gt; 1, the first parking lot is still available, but the k-th parking lot is taken. Now, we need to ensure that the car that wants to park in the first lot will find it occupied, which means that one of the cars among the first k-1 cars after the first driver must choose the first lot. There are k-1 cars that can choose the first lot, and for each of these choices, we have a subproblem with n-1 cars and n-1 parking lots. However, we must exclude the case where all of the first k-1 cars choose lots 2 through k, as this would leave the first lot unoccupied. This exclusion is another subproblem with k-1 cars and k-1 lots, which has P(k-1) solutions.

So, for k &gt; 1, we have (k-1) * P(n-1) - P(k-1) ways to park the cars.

Combining these two cases, we can write the recursive formula for P(n):

P(n) = P(n-1) + sum from k=2 to n of [(k-1) * P(n-1) - P(k-1)]

Now, let&#x27;s simplify this expression. The sum from k=2 to n of (k-1) * P(n-1) is just P(n-1) times the sum of the first (n-1) positive integers, which is (n-1)*n/2. So we have:

P(n) = P(n-1) + (n-1)*n/2 * P(n-1) - sum from k=2 to n of P(k-1)

Notice that the sum from k=2 to n of P(k-1) is just the sum of all P(i) for i from 1 to n-1.

Let&#x27;s denote S(n-1) = sum from i=1 to n-1 of P(i). Then we can rewrite the recursive formula as:

P(n) = P(n-1) + (n-1)*n/2 * P(n-1) - S(n-1)

Now, we need to find the base case. When n=1, there is only one parking lot and one car, so there is only one way to park. Thus, P(1) = 1.

Using this base case and the recursive formula, we can compute P(n) for any n. However, the problem asks for an expression in terms of n, which means we need to find a closed-form solution or a pattern that emerges from the recursive formula.

Unfortunately, finding a closed-form expression for P(n) is not straightforward due to the complexity of the recursive relationship. This problem is known as the &quot;menage problem&quot; or &quot;problem of married couples,&quot; and it does not have a simple closed-form solution. However, it is related to the derangement problem, which counts the number of permutations of a set with no fixed points (i.e., no number i is in position i), and it can be solved using inclusion-exclusion principle or generating functions.

The exact number of sequences for a given n can be computed using the recursive formula, but it requires calculating all previous values of P(n). For large n, this becomes computationally intensive, and it&#x27;s more practical to use a computer program to calculate P(n) than to try to solve it by hand.</code></pre>
