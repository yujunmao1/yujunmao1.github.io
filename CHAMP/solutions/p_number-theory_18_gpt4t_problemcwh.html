Problem: Find all integer solutions to the equation 15x^2-7y^2=9.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 7y^2=15x^2-9 is a multiple of 3, y must be a multiple of 3.
2. Define y=3u, and we have 15x^2-63u^2=9.
3. Thus, 5x^2=21u^2+3, which means that x is a also multiple of 3.
4. Define x=3v and we have 45v^2=21u^2+3, and get 15v^2-1=7u^2.
5. Since 7u^2 mod 3=15v^2-1 mod 3=2, u^2 mod 3=2.
6. However, for any integer u, u^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1.
7. Thus, the original equation has no integer solution.

Problem: Are there integer solutions to the equation (x^2-1)(y^2-1)+1981=z^2?
Step-wise solution:
1. If the equation has a solution, we have (x^2-1)(y^2-1)=z^2-1981.
2. Since u^2 mod 8∈{0, 1, 4}, we have u^2-1 mod 8∈{0, 3, 7} and (x^2-1)(y^2-1) mod 8∈{0, 1, 5}.
3. However, since 1981 mod 8=5, z^2-1981 mod 8∈{3, 4, 7}.
4. Since there is no overlapping values, we conclude that the equation has no solution.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation x^2-3y^2=17.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider the equation modulo 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 17, let&#x27;s follow a step-wise approach:

Step 1: Consider the equation modulo 3.
We know that any square number modulo 3 is either 0 or 1 because:

- If a number is divisible by 3, its square is also divisible by 3, so the square modulo 3 is 0.
- If a number is 1 more than a multiple of 3, its square is also 1 more than a multiple of 3, so the square modulo 3 is 1.
- If a number is 1 less than a multiple of 3, its square is 1 more than a multiple of 3, so the square modulo 3 is 1.

Therefore, x^2 modulo 3 can be 0 or 1, and -3y^2 modulo 3 can only be 0 because -3y^2 is always a multiple of 3. So, we have:

x^2 - 3y^2 ≡ 17 (mod 3)
x^2 ≡ 2 (mod 3)

However, as we&#x27;ve established, x^2 modulo 3 can only be 0 or 1, not 2. Therefore, there is no solution for x^2 modulo 3 to be 2, which means there are no integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 17 when considering it modulo 3.

Step 2: Check for potential solutions.
Despite the modulo 3 analysis, let&#x27;s see if there are any integer solutions that we might have missed by considering the equation in its original form:

x^2 - 3y^2 = 17

We can rewrite this as:

x^2 = 3y^2 + 17

Now, we need to find integers x and y such that x^2 is 17 more than a multiple of 3. Let&#x27;s check small values of y and see if we can find a corresponding x that satisfies the equation:

For y = 0, x^2 = 17, which gives us x = ±√17. Since √17 is not an integer, we discard this solution.

For y = 1, x^2 = 3(1)^2 + 17 = 20, which does not yield an integer x.

For y = 2, x^2 = 3(2)^2 + 17 = 29, which does not yield an integer x.

For y = 3, x^2 = 3(3)^2 + 17 = 44, which does not yield an integer x.

For y = 4, x^2 = 3(4)^2 + 17 = 65, which does not yield an integer x.

However, if we continue this process, we might find a y that gives us a perfect square for x^2. Let&#x27;s try y = 5:

For y = 5, x^2 = 3(5)^2 + 17 = 92, which does not yield an integer x.

But if we try y = 6:

For y = 6, x^2 = 3(6)^2 + 17 = 125, which does not yield an integer x.

Continuing this process is tedious, and we might not find a solution quickly. However, we can use a more systematic approach by considering Pell&#x27;s equation, which is a general form of the equation we are trying to solve:

x^2 - Dy^2 = N

In our case, D = 3 and N = 17. Pell&#x27;s equation has a well-known method for finding solutions using continued fractions for √D. However, since our initial analysis modulo 3 showed that there are no solutions, we can conclude that there are no integer solutions to the equation x^2 - 3y^2 = 17.</code></pre>
