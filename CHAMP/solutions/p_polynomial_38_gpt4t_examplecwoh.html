<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A polynomial f(x) of degree n is reciprocal if the coefficients of x^i and x^(n-i) are the same for all i=0, 1, ..., n, and such a polynomial with an odd degree n always has a root of -1 and can be written as f(x)=(x+1)g(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a reciprocal polynomial of degree 5, which is an odd degree. According to the definition, the coefficients of x^i and x^(5-i) must be the same for all i=0, 1, ..., 5. Let&#x27;s construct such a polynomial:

Let the polynomial be:

f(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f

Since f(x) is reciprocal, we have:

a = f (coefficient of x^5 and x^0)
b = e (coefficient of x^4 and x^1)
c = d (coefficient of x^3 and x^2)

So, our polynomial can be rewritten as:

f(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + cx^2 + bx + a

Now, let&#x27;s choose specific values for a, b, and c to make it a concrete example. Let&#x27;s say a=1, b=2, and c=3. Our polynomial becomes:

f(x) = x^5 + 2x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1

This polynomial is reciprocal because the coefficients of x^i and x^(5-i) are the same for all i=0, 1, ..., 5.

Now, since the degree of f(x) is odd, it must have a root at x = -1. We can factor out (x+1) to find the polynomial g(x):

f(x) = (x+1)(Ax^4 + Bx^3 + Cx^2 + Dx + E)

To find the coefficients A, B, C, D, and E, we can perform polynomial division or use synthetic division with the root x = -1. However, since we know that f(x) is reciprocal, we can deduce that g(x) will also have a reciprocal structure (with degree one less than f(x)):

g(x) = Ax^4 + Bx^3 + Cx^2 + Bx + A

Given that f(x) = x^5 + 2x^4 + 3x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1, we can see that:

A = 1 (since the constant term of f(x) is 1)
B = 1 (since the coefficient of x in f(x) is 2, and we have 2B when factoring out (x+1))
C = 1 (since the coefficient of x^2 in f(x) is 3, and we have C + B when factoring out (x+1))

So, g(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1

And we can verify that:

f(x) = (x+1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)

Indeed, if we substitute x = -1 into f(x), we get:

f(-1) = (-1)^5 + 2(-1)^4 + 3(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 + 2(-1) + 1 = -1 + 2 - 3 + 3 - 2 + 1 = 0

Thus, x = -1 is a root of f(x), as expected for a reciprocal polynomial of odd degree.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A polynomial f(x) of degree 2n is reciprocal if the coefficients of x^i and x^(2n-i) are the same for all i=0, 1, ..., n-1, and such a polynomial can be written in the form of f(x)=x^n*g(z) with z=x+1/x and g(z) is a polynomial in z of degree n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s construct a reciprocal polynomial f(x) of degree 2n, where n is a positive integer. For this example, let&#x27;s choose n=2, so we are looking for a reciprocal polynomial of degree 4.

According to the definition, the coefficients of x^i and x^(4-i) must be the same for all i=0, 1, ..., 2-1 (since n=2). Let&#x27;s define the polynomial as follows:

f(x) = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + bx + a

Here, a, b, and c are constants. Since f(x) is reciprocal, we have:

- The coefficient of x^4 (which is a) is the same as the coefficient of x^0 (which is also a).
- The coefficient of x^3 (which is b) is the same as the coefficient of x^1 (which is also b).

Now, let&#x27;s choose specific values for a, b, and c. Let&#x27;s say a=1, b=2, and c=3. Our polynomial becomes:

f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1

This polynomial is reciprocal because the coefficients of x^i and x^(4-i) are the same for all i=0, 1, 2.

Now, we want to express f(x) in the form of f(x) = x^n * g(z) with z = x + 1/x. Since n=2, we have:

f(x) = x^2 * g(z)

To find g(z), we need to express the terms of f(x) in terms of z. We know that:

z = x + 1/x
z^2 = (x + 1/x)^2 = x^2 + 2 + 1/x^2
z^2 - 2 = x^2 + 1/x^2

Now, let&#x27;s rewrite f(x) using z:

f(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 1
      = x^2 * (x^2 + 2x + 3 + 2/x + 1/x^2)
      = x^2 * (x^2 + 1/x^2 + 2(x + 1/x) + 3)
      = x^2 * (z^2 - 2 + 2z + 3)
      = x^2 * (z^2 + 2z + 1)

We can see that g(z) is a polynomial in z of degree 2 (which is n):

g(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1

Therefore, we have successfully expressed f(x) in the desired form:

f(x) = x^2 * (z^2 + 2z + 1)

where z = x + 1/x. The polynomial g(z) = z^2 + 2z + 1 is indeed a polynomial of degree 2 in z, as required.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

(x+y)^n=x^n+C(n,1)x^(n-1)*y+C(n,2)x^(n-2)*y^2+...+C(n,2)x^2*y^(n-2)+C(n,1)x*y^(n-1)+y^n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The expression you&#x27;ve provided is the binomial expansion of \((x+y)^n\), which can be written using the binomial coefficients \(C(n, k)\), also denoted as \(\binom{n}{k}\), where \(C(n, k)\) represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. This is also known as &quot;n choose k.&quot;

The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(x+y)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} C(n, k) x^{n-k} y^k
\]

where \(C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example where \(n=4\). We want to expand \((x+y)^4\):

\[
(x+y)^4 = x^4 + C(4,1)x^3y + C(4,2)x^2y^2 + C(4,3)xy^3 + y^4
\]

Now, we calculate the binomial coefficients:

\[
C(4,1) = \binom{4}{1} = \frac{4!}{1!(4-1)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{1 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 4
\]
\[
C(4,2) = \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 6
\]
\[
C(4,3) = \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = 4
\]

Plugging these values into our expansion, we get:

\[
(x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4
\]

This is the expanded form of \((x+y)^4\) using the binomial theorem. Each term in the expansion corresponds to a specific choice of \(k\) \(y\)&#x27;s and \(n-k\) \(x\)&#x27;s from the \(n\) total factors in the product \((x+y)^n\).</code></pre>

Find all real-valued solutions to the equation 4x^11+4x^10−21x^9-21x^8+17x^7+17x^6+17x^5+17x^4−21x^3-21x^2+4x+4=0.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the polynomial equation

\[ 4x^{11} + 4x^{10} - 21x^9 - 21x^8 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4 - 21x^3 - 21x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0, \]

we can look for patterns that might simplify the problem. One thing that stands out is that the coefficients seem to repeat in a certain way, suggesting that the polynomial might be factorable by grouping. Let&#x27;s try to group terms with the same coefficients:

\[ (4x^{11} + 4x^{10}) - (21x^9 + 21x^8) + (17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4) - (21x^3 + 21x^2) + (4x + 4). \]

Now, factor out the common factors in each group:

\[ 4x^{10}(x + 1) - 21x^8(x + 1) + 17x^4(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) - 21x^2(x + 1) + 4(x + 1). \]

Notice that each group contains the factor \(x + 1\). We can factor \(x + 1\) out of the entire expression:

\[ (x + 1)(4x^{10} - 21x^8 + 17x^4(x^3 + x^2 + x + 1) - 21x^2 + 4). \]

Now, let&#x27;s look at the remaining polynomial inside the parentheses. We can see that it has a structure that suggests it might be a reciprocal polynomial. To confirm this, let&#x27;s rewrite it and check if the coefficients of \(x^i\) and \(x^{10-i}\) are the same:

\[ 4x^{10} - 21x^8 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4 - 21x^2 + 4. \]

We can see that the coefficients are indeed the same for \(x^{10}\) and the constant term, for \(x^8\) and \(x^2\), and the middle terms are all 17, which suggests that this is a reciprocal polynomial of degree 10. Since the degree is even, we can write it in the form \(x^5g(z)\) with \(z = x + \frac{1}{x}\):

\[ 4x^{10} - 21x^8 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4 - 21x^2 + 4 = x^5(4x^5 - 21x^3 + 17x^2 + 17x + 17 + \frac{17}{x} - \frac{21}{x^2} + \frac{4}{x^5}). \]

Now, let&#x27;s express the terms inside the parentheses in terms of \(z\):

\[ z = x + \frac{1}{x}, \]
\[ z^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2}, \]
\[ z^3 = x^3 + 3x + \frac{3}{x} + \frac{1}{x^3}. \]

We can see that the polynomial inside the parentheses is not immediately expressible in terms of \(z\), so we may have made a mistake in assuming it was a reciprocal polynomial of the form \(x^5g(z)\). Let&#x27;s go back to the factored form with \(x + 1\) and try to factor the remaining polynomial differently:

\[ (x + 1)(4x^{10} - 21x^8 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4 - 21x^2 + 4). \]

We can try to factor by grouping again, but this time we&#x27;ll look for a different pattern. Let&#x27;s group the terms with the same coefficients:

\[ (x + 1)(4x^{10} + 4 - 21x^8 - 21x^2 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4). \]

Now, let&#x27;s factor out the common factors in each group:

\[ (x + 1)(4(x^{10} + 1) - 21x^2(x^6 + 1) + 17x^4(x^3 + 1)). \]

We can see that \(x^{10} + 1\), \(x^6 + 1\), and \(x^3 + 1\) are sums of powers of \(x\). These can be factored further using the sum of cubes and the sum of squares formulas, but the expression is getting quite complex.

At this point, it&#x27;s clear that the polynomial does not factor in a straightforward manner, and we may need to use numerical methods or graphing to find the real-valued solutions. However, we do know that \(x = -1\) is a solution because of the factor \(x + 1\). To find the other solutions, we would typically turn to numerical methods such as Newton&#x27;s method, synthetic division, or graphing to approximate the roots or use a computer algebra system to find the exact roots if they can be expressed in a closed form.

Given the complexity of the polynomial, finding all real-valued solutions by hand is not practical. However, we have at least found one real solution: \(x = -1\).</code></pre>
