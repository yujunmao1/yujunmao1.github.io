<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: square of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that describe the expansion of the square of a sum or difference of two terms. These formulas are very useful in simplifying algebraic expressions and solving equations. Here are the formulas:

1. Square of a sum formula:
The square of a sum formula states that the square of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers plus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

This formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a + b) by itself:

(a + b)(a + b) = a² + ab + ba + b²
               = a² + ab + ab + b²
               = a² + 2ab + b²

2. Square of a difference formula:
The square of a difference formula states that the square of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers minus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

Similarly, this formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a - b) by itself:

(a - b)(a - b) = a² - ab - ba + b²
               = a² - ab - ab + b²
               = a² - 2ab + b²

These formulas are part of the larger family of binomial expansion formulas and are particularly helpful in simplifying expressions without having to perform the full binomial multiplication. They are also used in various mathematical applications, including geometry, calculus, and number theory.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:

a ≡ b (mod n)

This means that when a and b are divided by n, they leave the same remainder.

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n). In other words, the sum of two congruent numbers is also congruent to the sum of their respective equivalents.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n). Similar to addition, the difference between two congruent numbers is congruent to the difference of their respective equivalents.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n). The product of two congruent numbers is congruent to the product of their respective equivalents.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), it is not necessarily true that a/c ≡ b/d (mod n). Division is only valid if the divisor is coprime with the modulus (i.e., the divisor and the modulus share no common factors other than 1). In such cases, you can multiply by the multiplicative inverse of the divisor modulo n to &quot;divide.&quot;

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then for any positive integer k, a^k ≡ b^k (mod n). The power of a congruent number is congruent to the power of its equivalent.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular multiplicative inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not every number has a modular inverse; a number a has an inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

These rules make modular arithmetic a powerful tool in various fields of mathematics and computer science, especially in number theory, cryptography, and for performing computations with large numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 4?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Assuming that none of x, y, z is divisible by 4, consider different parity situations of x, y, z.
2. Consider the equation modulo 8.
3. For odd x, x^2 mod 8=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s analyze the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 under the assumption that none of x, y, z is divisible by 4. We will consider the parity of x, y, and z and then look at the equation modulo 8.

First, note that if an integer is even, it can be written as 2k for some integer k, and its square will be (2k)^2 = 4k^2, which is divisible by 4. If an integer is odd, it can be written as 2k + 1 for some integer k, and its square will be (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1, which is 1 more than a multiple of 4.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the parity of x, y, and z:

1. If x and y are both even, then x^2 and y^2 are both divisible by 4, and so z^2 must also be divisible by 4, which means z is even. But we are assuming none of x, y, z is divisible by 4, so this case is not possible.

2. If x and y are both odd, then x^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) and y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Adding these together, we get x^2 + y^2 ≡ 1 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 8). However, for z^2 to be a square and equal to x^2 + y^2, it must be congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8 (since z^2 is a square of an integer, and the square of an even number is divisible by 4, while the square of an odd number is 1 more than a multiple of 8). Since 2 is not congruent to 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8, this case is also not possible.

3. If one of x or y is even and the other is odd, then the even one squared is divisible by 4, and the odd one squared is 1 more than a multiple of 4. So, the sum x^2 + y^2 would be 1 more than a multiple of 4, which cannot be a perfect square (since a perfect square must be 0 or 1 modulo 4). This case is also not possible.

From the above analysis, we see that it is not possible for none of x, y, z to be divisible by 4. Therefore, at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 4.

However, we can say more. Since we have established that both x and y cannot be odd (from case 2), at least one of x or y must be even. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s say x is even. Then x^2 is divisible by 4. If y were also even, then y^2 would also be divisible by 4, and z^2 would be the sum of two numbers divisible by 4, which means z would also be even. In this case, at least two of the numbers x, y, z would be divisible by 4.

If y is odd, then y^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8), and since x is even and divisible by 4, x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 8). Adding these, we get x^2 + y^2 ≡ 0 + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 8), which means z^2 ≡ 1 (mod 8), and z is odd. In this case, only one of the numbers is divisible by 4.

In conclusion, at least one of the numbers must be divisible by 4, and depending on the parity of x and y, it could be that two of the numbers are divisible by 4.</code></pre>
