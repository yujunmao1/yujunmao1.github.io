<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} have no two successive numbers?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is one way to solve the problem:

We can first count the number of subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} that have at least two successive numbers. There are 10C2 = 45 such subsets.

Next, we can count the number of subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} that have exactly one successive number. There are 10C1 = 10 such subsets.

Finally, we can subtract the number of subsets with at least two successive numbers from the total number of subsets to get the number of subsets with no two successive numbers. This gives us 10C0 - 10C1 + 10C2 = 252 - 10 + 45 = 297.

Here is another way to solve the problem:

We can first count the number of ways to choose 5 numbers from {1, 2,..., 10} without replacement. This is equal to 10C5 = 252.

Next, we can count the number of ways to arrange these 5 numbers in order. This is equal to 5! = 120.

Finally, we can divide the number of ways to choose 5 numbers from {1, 2,..., 10} without replacement by the number of ways to arrange these 5 numbers in order. This gives us 252 / 120 = 2.

However, this is overcounting the number of subsets with no two successive numbers, because we are counting each subset with a different order as a different subset. For example, the subsets {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and {3, 1, 5, 7, 9} are counted as two different subsets, even though they are the same subset.

To correct for this overcounting, we can divide the number of ways to choose 5 numbers from {1, 2,..., 10} without replacement by the number of ways to order these 5 numbers in order, and then divide by the number of ways to order a set of 5 distinct objects. This is equal to 252 / 120 / 5! = 2.

Therefore, there are 297 subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} with no two successive numbers.</code></pre>
