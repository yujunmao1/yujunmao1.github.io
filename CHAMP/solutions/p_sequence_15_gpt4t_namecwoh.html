<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: inequality of arithmetic and geometric means for 2 variables.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The inequality of arithmetic and geometric means (AM-GM inequality) is a fundamental result in algebra that relates the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean of a set of non-negative real numbers. For two variables, the AM-GM inequality states that for any two non-negative real numbers \( a \) and \( b \), the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab}
\]

Here, \( \frac{a + b}{2} \) is the arithmetic mean of \( a \) and \( b \), and \( \sqrt{ab} \) is the geometric mean of \( a \) and \( b \).

The equality holds if and only if \( a = b \). If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, then both the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean are equal to \( a \) (or \( b \)), and thus the inequality becomes an equality.

To understand why this inequality is true, consider the following algebraic proof:

1. Start with the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. That is, for any real number \( x \), we have \( x^2 \geq 0 \).

2. Let \( x = a - b \). Then \( x^2 = (a - b)^2 \geq 0 \).

3. Expanding the square, we get \( a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \geq 0 \).

4. Adding \( 4ab \) to both sides of the inequality, we obtain \( a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \geq 4ab \).

5. Notice that the left side of the inequality is a perfect square: \( (a + b)^2 \geq 4ab \).

6. Taking the square root of both sides (which is valid since both sides are non-negative), we get \( a + b \geq 2\sqrt{ab} \).

7. Dividing both sides by 2 yields the AM-GM inequality for two variables: \( \frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab} \).

The AM-GM inequality is a special case of the more general AM-GM inequality for \( n \) non-negative real numbers, which states that the arithmetic mean of the numbers is always greater than or equal to the geometric mean of the same numbers. The AM-GM inequality has applications in various fields of mathematics, including optimization, number theory, and probability theory.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divergence of harmonic series.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The harmonic series is an infinite series that is defined as the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers:

\[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \cdots \]

The divergence of the harmonic series means that this series does not converge to a finite limit; instead, its sum grows without bound as more terms are added.

To understand why the harmonic series diverges, consider the following intuitive argument:

1. Group the terms of the harmonic series in blocks that double in size:

\[ 1 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8}\right) + \cdots \]

2. Notice that each block (after the first) has terms that are all less than or equal to the first term of the block. For example, in the block \( \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \), both terms are less than or equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \), and in the block \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8} \), all terms are less than or equal to \( \frac{1}{4} \).

3. This means that each block (after the first) has a sum that is greater than or equal to \( \frac{1}{2} \). For example:

\[ \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \geq \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{8} \geq \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \]

4. Since each block contributes at least \( \frac{1}{2} \) to the sum, and there are infinitely many such blocks, the total sum must be infinite.

A more formal proof of the divergence of the harmonic series uses the integral test for convergence of series. The integral test states that if \( f(n) \) is a positive, continuous, and decreasing function for \( n \geq 1 \), then the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n) \) converges if and only if the integral \( \int_{1}^{\infty} f(x) \, dx \) converges.

For the harmonic series, we can consider the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x} \), which is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \( x \geq 1 \). The integral of \( f(x) \) from 1 to infinity is:

\[ \int_{1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} \, dx = \lim_{t \to \infty} \ln(t) - \ln(1) \]

Since the natural logarithm function \( \ln(t) \) grows without bound as \( t \) approaches infinity, the integral diverges, and by the integral test, the harmonic series also diverges.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Does there exist a positive sequence {a_n}, such that both sum a_n and sum 1/(n^2*a_n) converge to finite values?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether there exists a positive sequence \(\{a_n\}\) such that both \(\sum a_n\) and \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\) converge to finite values, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for series. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any two sequences of real numbers \(\{b_n\}\) and \(\{c_n\}\), the following inequality holds:

\[
\left(\sum b_n c_n\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum b_n^2\right) \left(\sum c_n^2\right)
\]

Let&#x27;s apply this inequality to the sequences \(\{a_n\}\) and \(\{\frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\}\). We have:

\[
\left(\sum a_n \cdot \frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\right)^2 \leq \left(\sum a_n^2\right) \left(\sum \frac{1}{(n^2 a_n)^2}\right)
\]

Notice that the left-hand side simplifies to:

\[
\left(\sum \frac{1}{n^2}\right)^2
\]

The series \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2}\) is the Riemann zeta function evaluated at 2, which is known to converge to \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\). Therefore, the left-hand side of the inequality is a finite value:

\[
\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\right)^2
\]

Now, if both \(\sum a_n\) and \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\) are to converge, then both \(\sum a_n^2\) and \(\sum \frac{1}{(n^2 a_n)^2}\) must also converge, because the terms of these series are non-negative and the squares of convergent series terms are also convergent.

However, we have not used any specific properties of the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) yet. To ensure that both \(\sum a_n\) and \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\) converge, we need to choose a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) that makes both series convergent.

One way to guarantee convergence is to choose \(a_n\) such that \(a_n\) itself is a convergent series and \(1/(n^2 a_n)\) is also a convergent series. For example, we could choose \(a_n = \frac{1}{n}\). Then we have:

\[
\sum a_n = \sum \frac{1}{n}
\]

This is the harmonic series, which diverges. Therefore, choosing \(a_n = \frac{1}{n}\) does not work.

Instead, let&#x27;s choose \(a_n = \frac{1}{n^2}\). Then we have:

\[
\sum a_n = \sum \frac{1}{n^2}
\]

This series converges to \(\frac{\pi^2}{6}\), as mentioned earlier. Now let&#x27;s check the convergence of the second series:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n} = \sum \frac{1}{n^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n^2}} = \sum 1
\]

This series clearly diverges, as it is the sum of 1 added to itself infinitely many times.

Therefore, the choice of \(a_n = \frac{1}{n^2}\) does not work either. We need to find a sequence \(\{a_n\}\) that decays faster than \(\frac{1}{n^2}\) to ensure the convergence of both series.

Let&#x27;s try \(a_n = \frac{1}{n^3}\). Then we have:

\[
\sum a_n = \sum \frac{1}{n^3}
\]

This series converges because it is a p-series with \(p &gt; 1\). Now let&#x27;s check the convergence of the second series:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n} = \sum \frac{1}{n^2 \cdot \frac{1}{n^3}} = \sum \frac{n}{n^2} = \sum \frac{1}{n}
\]

Unfortunately, this series is the harmonic series again, which diverges.

It seems that for any sequence \(\{a_n\}\) that decays as a power of \(n\), one of the two series will diverge. However, we can consider a sequence that decays faster than any polynomial, such as \(a_n = \frac{1}{2^n}\). Let&#x27;s check if this choice works:

\[
\sum a_n = \sum \frac{1}{2^n}
\]

This is a geometric series with a ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\), which converges to a finite value. Now let&#x27;s check the second series:

\[
\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n} = \sum \frac{1}{n^2 \cdot \frac{1}{2^n}} = \sum \frac{2^n}{n^2}
\]

This series also converges. To see why, notice that \(2^n\) grows exponentially, while \(n^2\) grows polynomially. Therefore, the terms of the series \(\frac{2^n}{n^2}\) approach 0 as \(n\) goes to infinity, and the series converges by the comparison test (comparing it to a geometric series with a ratio less than 1).

In conclusion, the sequence \(a_n = \frac{1}{2^n}\) is an example of a positive sequence for which both \(\sum a_n\) and \(\sum \frac{1}{n^2 a_n}\) converge to finite values.</code></pre>
