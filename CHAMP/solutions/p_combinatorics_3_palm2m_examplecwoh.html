<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.

Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

I hope this helps!</code></pre>

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column is given by the Catalan number $C_n$. The Catalan numbers can be defined recursively as follows:

$$C_0 = 1, C_1 = 1, C_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} C_k C_{n-1-k}$$

or in terms of factorials as follows:

$$C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n}$$

The Catalan numbers have many interesting properties. For example, they count the number of ways to partition a set of $n$ objects into pairs. They also count the number of ways to draw $n$ non-crossing Dyck paths on a $2\times n$ grid.

To see why the Catalan numbers count the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column, consider the following diagram:

[Diagram of a chess board with $n$ rooks placed on it so that no two rooks are in the same row or column]

Each rook can be thought of as representing a pair of diagonals on the chess board. For example, the rook in the top left corner represents the diagonals from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$ and from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$.

It is easy to see that any two rooks must represent different pairs of diagonals, since they cannot be in the same row or column. Conversely, any set of $n$ pairs of diagonals corresponds to a placement of $n$ rooks on the chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column.

Therefore, the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column is given by the Catalan number $C_n$.

Now, suppose we want to find the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column and the placement is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation. In other words, we want to find the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that the placement looks the same after a 180-degree rotation.

To do this, we can use the following argument. Consider the following diagram:

[Diagram of a chess board with $n$ rooks placed on it so that no two rooks are in the same row or column, with the rooks in the top left and bottom right corners labeled $R$ and $S$, respectively]

The rooks in the top left and bottom right corners of the diagram represent the same pair of diagonals, since they are both in the same diagonals from $(1,1)$ to $(n,n)$ and from $(1,n)$ to $(n,1)$.

Therefore, if we rotate the chess board by 180 degrees, the rooks in the top left and bottom right corners will swap places. This means that the placement of the rooks is not invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

In general, if we have a placement of $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column, then there will always be two rooks that represent the same pair of diagonals. This is because the rooks must be placed in such a way that they form a closed polygon. If there were only one rook in each diagonal, then the polygon would be a line segment, which is not closed.

Therefore, the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board so that no two rooks are in the same row or column and the placement is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation is zero.</code></pre>
