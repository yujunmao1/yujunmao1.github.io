<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation is given by the following formula:

$$P(n) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } n = 1 \\\ 2 &amp; \text{if } n = 2 \\\ \frac{1}{n} \binom{2n}{n} &amp; \text{if } n \ge 3 \end{cases}$$

To prove this formula, we will use a recursive argument. The base case is $n=1$, in which case there is only one way to place a rook on the board.

For the inductive step, assume that we know how to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation. We will show how to place $n+1$ rooks on an $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

There are two cases to consider:

* If the first row of the $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ board is already occupied by a rook, then we can place the $(n+1)$st rook in any of the $n$ remaining rows. The remaining $n$ rooks can then be placed peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation on the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ board below the first row, for a total of $n$ ways to place the rooks.
* If the first row of the $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ board is not occupied by a rook, then we can place the $(n+1)$st rook in the first row and then place the remaining $n$ rooks peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation on the $(n-1)\times(n-1)$ board below the first row, for a total of $n$ ways to place the rooks.

Therefore, the total number of ways to place $n+1$ rooks on an $(n+1)\times(n+1)$ board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation is $2n$.

This completes the inductive step. By the principle of mathematical induction, the formula holds for all $n\ge 1$.</code></pre>
