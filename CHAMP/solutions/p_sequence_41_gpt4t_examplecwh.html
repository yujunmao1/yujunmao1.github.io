A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

a_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^n)

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is positive, so adding another term to the sum will always make the sum larger. In other words, for all n in the natural numbers, a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

The sequence is also bounded above. Specifically, it is bounded by the sum of the infinite series:

S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...

This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1 is given by the formula S = a / (1 - r). In this case, the sum is:

S = 1 / (1 - 1/2) = 1 / (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the sequence (a_n) is bounded above by 2.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 2. So, we can say that:

lim (n -&gt; ∞) a_n = 2

This means that as n becomes very large, the value of a_n gets arbitrarily close to 2.</code></pre>

For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The statement &quot;For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y) if and only if x ≥ y&quot; is a property of square roots that holds true for all non-negative real numbers. Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example:

Let x = 16 and y = 9, which are both non-negative numbers.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the square roots of both numbers:

sqrt(x) = sqrt(16) = 4
sqrt(y) = sqrt(9) = 3

We can see that sqrt(x) = 4 is greater than sqrt(y) = 3. According to the property, this should mean that x is also greater than y. Indeed, we have:

x = 16 &gt; 9 = y

This example confirms the property: since sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y), it follows that x ≥ y. Conversely, because x ≥ y, we can also conclude that sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y). This is a bidirectional implication, meaning that one statement implies the other and vice versa, but it is important to note that this property only holds for non-negative values of x and y, as square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers (they are complex numbers).</code></pre>

A polynomial of degree n with root x_1, ..., x_n can be written as a(x-x_1)(x-x_2)...(x-x_n) for some value of a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a polynomial of degree 3, which means it will have 3 roots (real or complex). Suppose the roots are x_1 = 2, x_2 = -1, and x_3 = 3. According to the concept, we can express the polynomial P(x) with these roots as:

P(x) = a(x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)

Substituting the given roots into the equation, we get:

P(x) = a(x - 2)(x - (-1))(x - 3)
P(x) = a(x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 3)

The value of &#x27;a&#x27; is the leading coefficient of the polynomial. If we don&#x27;t have any additional information about the polynomial, &#x27;a&#x27; can be any non-zero constant. If we know, for example, that the leading coefficient is 1 (which means the polynomial is monic), then &#x27;a&#x27; would be 1, and the polynomial would be:

P(x) = (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 3)

If we want to expand this polynomial, we can multiply the factors:

P(x) = (x^2 + x - 2x - 2)(x - 3)
P(x) = (x^2 - x - 2)(x - 3)
P(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 - x^2 + 3x - 2x + 6
P(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6

So, if &#x27;a&#x27; is 1, the polynomial with roots 2, -1, and 3 is:

P(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6

This polynomial is indeed of degree 3, and it has the specified roots. The factorization into (x - 2)(x + 1)(x - 3) confirms that when x is substituted with any of the roots, the polynomial evaluates to zero, which is consistent with the definition of a root.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a&gt;0, does the limit of the sequence defined by a_0=sqrt(a), a_(n+1)=sqrt(a+a_n) exist, and if so, find it as an expression of a.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To investigate whether the limit of the sequence defined by \( a_0 = \sqrt{a} \) and \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a + a_n} \) exists, we can use the concept that a monotonic and bounded sequence has a limit.

First, let&#x27;s show that the sequence is monotonic. We will prove by induction that the sequence is monotonically increasing, assuming \( a &gt; 0 \).

**Base case (n=0):**
We have \( a_0 = \sqrt{a} \) and \( a_1 = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a}} \). Since \( a + \sqrt{a} &gt; a \), it follows that \( a_1 &gt; a_0 \).

**Inductive step:**
Assume \( a_n &gt; a_{n-1} \) for some \( n \geq 1 \). We want to show that \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \).

Since \( a_n &gt; a_{n-1} \), we have \( a + a_n &gt; a + a_{n-1} \). Taking square roots of both sides (which preserves the inequality because both sides are non-negative), we get \( \sqrt{a + a_n} &gt; \sqrt{a + a_{n-1}} \), which means \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \).

Thus, by induction, the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is monotonically increasing.

Next, we need to show that the sequence is bounded above. Notice that for all \( n \), \( a_n &gt; 0 \). Then \( a + a_n &gt; a \), and taking square roots gives \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a + a_n} &lt; \sqrt{2a_n} \). Since \( a_n &gt; 0 \), we can square both sides to get \( a_{n+1}^2 &lt; 2a_n \). This implies that \( a_{n+1}^2 - 2a_n &lt; 0 \), or \( a_{n+1}^2 &lt; 2a_n \). If we assume that the sequence is bounded above by some number \( L \), then \( a_n &lt; L \) for all \( n \), and we would have \( a_{n+1}^2 &lt; 2L \). This suggests that \( L \) must satisfy \( L^2 \leq 2L \), which simplifies to \( L \leq 2 \) when \( L &gt; 0 \). However, we need to find \( L \) in terms of \( a \), not just a constant bound.

To find such an \( L \), let&#x27;s assume the sequence converges to a limit \( L \). Then, taking the limit on both sides of the recursive definition \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{a + a_n} \), we get:

\[ L = \sqrt{a + L} \]

Squaring both sides gives:

\[ L^2 = a + L \]

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[ L^2 - L - a = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation in \( L \). The solutions to this equation are given by the quadratic formula:

\[ L = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \]

Since \( L \) must be non-negative (as it is the limit of a sequence of non-negative terms), we discard the negative root and take the positive root:

\[ L = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \]

This is the expression for the limit of the sequence in terms of \( a \), assuming the limit exists. We have shown that the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above by \( L \), so by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the limit exists and is equal to \( L \). Therefore, the limit of the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) as \( n \to \infty \) is:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 4a}}{2} \]</code></pre>
