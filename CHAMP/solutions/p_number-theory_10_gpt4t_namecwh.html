<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are the basic rules and concepts of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers `a` and `b` are said to be congruent modulo `n` if their difference `a - b` is an integer multiple of `n`. This is denoted as `a ≡ b (mod n)`. For example, 38 is congruent to 14 modulo 12 because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n)`.
- Subtraction: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n)`.
- Multiplication: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n)`.

3. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. An integer `a` can be divided by an integer `b` modulo `n` if there exists an integer `b&#x27;` such that `b * b&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. The integer `b&#x27;` is called the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `n`. If such a `b&#x27;` exists, then `a / b ≡ a * b&#x27; (mod n)`.

4. Modular Inverses:
An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if there exists an integer `a&#x27;` such that `a * a&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Not every integer has a modular inverse. An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if and only if `a` and `n` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

5. Properties:
- The set of integers modulo `n` forms a complete set of residues from `0` to `n-1`. Any integer is congruent to exactly one of these residues.
- Modular arithmetic preserves the usual properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The distributive law holds in modular arithmetic: `a * (b + c) ≡ (a * b) + (a * c) (mod n)`.

6. Applications:
Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is essential for algorithms involving hashing, pseudo-random number generation, and for the arithmetic of large numbers as in RSA encryption.

Understanding these rules allows you to perform arithmetic computations with integers in a modular system, which can be visualized as a circle with `n` points, where `n` is the modulus. When you reach the `n`-th point, you wrap around back to zero, much like the hours on a clock.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer-valued solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 5?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the equation modulo 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will consider the given equation modulo 5. The equation is:

x^2 + y^2 = z^2

We want to know how many of the numbers x, y, and z must be divisible by 5. Let&#x27;s look at the possible remainders when an integer is squared modulo 5:

- If a number is divisible by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k for some integer k), then its square is also divisible by 5: (5k)^2 = 25k^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5).
- If a number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k + 1), then its square has a remainder of 1: (5k + 1)^2 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5).
- If a number has a remainder of 2 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k + 2), then its square has a remainder of 4: (5k + 2)^2 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5).
- If a number has a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k + 3), then its square has a remainder of 4 as well: (5k + 3)^2 = 25k^2 + 30k + 9 ≡ 4 (mod 5).
- If a number has a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k + 4), then its square has a remainder of 1: (5k + 4)^2 = 25k^2 + 40k + 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible sums of two squares modulo 5:

- 0 + 0 ≡ 0 (mod 5)
- 1 + 1 ≡ 2 (mod 5)
- 1 + 4 ≡ 0 (mod 5)
- 4 + 4 ≡ 3 (mod 5)

We can see that the only way to get a sum of squares that is divisible by 5 (i.e., has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5) is when both squares are divisible by 5 (0 + 0) or when one square has a remainder of 1 and the other has a remainder of 4 (1 + 4).

Now, let&#x27;s apply this to our equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2. For the right-hand side (z^2) to be divisible by 5, z must be divisible by 5. This is because only a square of a multiple of 5 will give a remainder of 0 when divided by 5.

For the left-hand side (x^2 + y^2) to be divisible by 5, we have two cases:
- Both x and y are divisible by 5, which means x^2 and y^2 are both divisible by 5.
- One of x or y has a square that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 5, and the other leaves a remainder of 4.

However, since z^2 is divisible by 5, and the only way for x^2 + y^2 to be divisible by 5 is for both x^2 and y^2 to be divisible by 5 or for their squares to leave remainders of 1 and 4, we can conclude that at least one of x or y must also be divisible by 5.

Therefore, at least two of the numbers x, y, and z must be divisible by 5.</code></pre>
