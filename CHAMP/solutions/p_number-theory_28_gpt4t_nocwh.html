<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How often does the factor 2 occur in the product P(n)=(n+1)(n+2)...(2n), as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Use induction from n=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine how often the factor 2 occurs in the product \( P(n) = (n+1)(n+2)...(2n) \), we need to count the number of times each term in the product is divisible by 2. This is equivalent to counting the powers of 2 in the prime factorization of each term.

Let&#x27;s start with the base case of induction, \( n = 1 \):

\( P(1) = (1+1)(1+2) = 2 \cdot 3 \)

In this case, the factor 2 occurs once.

Now, let&#x27;s assume that for some \( k \geq 1 \), the statement is true, and \( P(k) \) contains a certain number of factors of 2. We need to show that \( P(k+1) \) contains the correct number of factors of 2.

\( P(k+1) = (k+2)(k+3)...(2k+1)(2k+2) \)

Notice that \( P(k+1) \) contains all the terms of \( P(k) \) except for \( k+1 \), and it includes an additional term \( 2k+2 \). Since \( 2k+2 \) is clearly divisible by 2, it will contribute at least one additional factor of 2 to the product.

However, we need to consider that when we move from \( P(k) \) to \( P(k+1) \), we lose the term \( k+1 \), which may or may not be divisible by 2. If \( k+1 \) is even, then we are losing a factor of 2 that was present in \( P(k) \). If \( k+1 \) is odd, then we are not losing any factor of 2.

So, the change in the number of factors of 2 from \( P(k) \) to \( P(k+1) \) depends on whether \( k+1 \) is even or odd:

- If \( k+1 \) is even, then \( P(k+1) \) will have the same number of factors of 2 as \( P(k) \), plus one more from the term \( 2k+2 \).
- If \( k+1 \) is odd, then \( P(k+1) \) will have one more factor of 2 than \( P(k) \), also from the term \( 2k+2 \).

Now, let&#x27;s count the number of even numbers in the product \( P(n) \). There are \( n \) terms in the product, and exactly half of them are even because they are consecutive integers from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \). Therefore, there are \( n/2 \) even numbers if \( n \) is even, and \( (n-1)/2 \) even numbers if \( n \) is odd (since \( n+1 \) would be even in this case).

However, some of these even numbers could be divisible by 4, 8, 16, and so on, contributing more than one factor of 2. We need to count all powers of 2 that divide these even numbers.

Let&#x27;s define \( f(n) \) as the number of factors of 2 in \( P(n) \). We can express \( f(n) \) as the sum of the number of factors of 2 in each even number from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \):

\( f(n) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{number of factors of 2 in } (n+i) \)

To find the exact expression for \( f(n) \), we need to consider the contribution of each power of 2. For each \( i \) such that \( n+i \) is divisible by \( 2^k \), we add \( k \) to the sum. This is a more complex problem that requires careful analysis of the divisibility of the terms in the sequence by increasing powers of 2.

Let&#x27;s start by counting the multiples of 2 (which is \( 2^1 \)). As we&#x27;ve established, there are \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor \) multiples of 2 in the sequence from \( n+1 \) to \( 2n \) (where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \)).

Next, we count the multiples of \( 2^2 = 4 \). There are \( \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor \) multiples of 4 in the sequence.

Continuing this pattern, for each power of 2, \( 2^k \), we count the multiples of \( 2^k \) in the sequence, which is \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \rfloor \).

The total number of factors of 2 in \( P(n) \) is the sum of these counts for all powers of 2 up to the point where \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \rfloor = 0 \) (since there are no multiples of \( 2^k \) greater than \( n \)):

\( f(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \rfloor \)

This sum is finite because \( \lfloor \frac{n}{2^k} \rfloor \) becomes 0 when \( 2^k &gt; n \).

So, the number of times the factor 2 occurs in the product \( P(n) \) is given by the sum of the floor of \( n \) divided by each power of 2, starting from \( 2^1 \) and continuing until the quotient is zero.</code></pre>
