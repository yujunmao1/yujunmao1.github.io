<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
In other words, you can add the remainders of two numbers and the sum will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
Similar to addition, you can subtract the remainders of two numbers and the difference will have the same remainder when divided by the modulus.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
When you multiply two numbers, you can multiply their remainders to get the remainder of the product when divided by the modulus.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You cannot simply divide the remainders unless the number you are dividing by is coprime with the modulus (they share no common divisors other than 1). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), and c has a multiplicative inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / d) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
You can raise both sides of a congruence to a power, and the result will be congruent modulo n.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have modular inverses; an integer a has a modular inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

8. Chinese Remainder Theorem:
This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory, as well as in practical applications such as calculating the day of the week for a given date. It simplifies arithmetic for large numbers by dealing with their remainders and has properties that are useful in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive value of the expression |36^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. This means we are looking for the smallest difference between a power of 36 and a power of 5.

Since 36 is a perfect square (6^2), we can rewrite 36^m as (6^2)^m = 6^(2m). Now, we are looking for the smallest difference between 6^(2m) and 5^n.

Let&#x27;s start by examining small values of m and n to see if we can find a pair that gives us a small difference:

For m = 1 (which implies 2m = 2), we have 6^2 = 36. Now let&#x27;s try small values of n:
- If n = 1, then 5^1 = 5, and |36 - 5| = 31.
- If n = 2, then 5^2 = 25, and |36 - 25| = 11.

For m = 2 (which implies 2m = 4), we have 6^4 = 1296. Now let&#x27;s try small values of n:
- If n = 3, then 5^3 = 125, and |1296 - 125| = 1171.
- If n = 4, then 5^4 = 625, and |1296 - 625| = 671.

We can see that the differences are getting larger, so let&#x27;s go back to smaller powers and try to find a closer match.

For m = 1 and n = 2, we had the smallest difference so far, which was 11. Let&#x27;s see if we can find an even smaller difference by examining powers of 5 that are close to powers of 36:

- 5^3 = 125 is close to 6^3 = 216, but |216 - 125| = 91, which is not smaller than 11.
- 5^4 = 625 is close to 6^4 = 1296, but we&#x27;ve already seen that the difference is not smaller than 11.

It seems that the smallest difference we&#x27;ve found so far is 11, which occurs when m = 1 and n = 2. To confirm that this is indeed the smallest possible value, we would need to consider the general behavior of the function |36^m - 5^n| as m and n increase.

As m and n get larger, the values of 36^m and 5^n grow exponentially. Since the bases are different (36 and 5), the difference between 36^m and 5^n will also grow exponentially, making it unlikely to find a smaller difference than 11 for larger values of m and n.

Therefore, the smallest value of |36^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is 11, which occurs when m = 1 and n = 2.</code></pre>
