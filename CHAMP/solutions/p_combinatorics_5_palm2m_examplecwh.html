<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} have no two successive numbers?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider a string of 0s and 1s, where a digit 1 at i-th place means that i is included in the subset. Find the constraint on the string.
2. Let P(n) be the number of such strings of length n and express P(n) as P(n-1) and P(n-2).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We can solve this problem by considering a string of 0s and 1s, where a digit 1 at the $i$th place means that $i$ is included in the subset. The constraint on the string is that there can be no two consecutive 1s.

Let $P(n)$ be the number of such strings of length $n$. We can see that $P(0) = 1$, since there is only one way to create a string of length 0 with no two consecutive 1s.

For $n &gt; 0$, we can create a string of length $n$ by either starting with a 0 and then adding a string of length $n-1$ with no two consecutive 1s, or by starting with a 1 and then adding a string of length $n-2$ with no two consecutive 1s. This is because if we start with a 0, we can only add numbers that are not 1, and if we start with a 1, we can only add numbers that are not 2.

So, we have $P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2)$. This is a recurrence relation, and we can solve it using the method of generating functions.

The generating function for $P(n)$ is $G(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} P(n) x^n$. We can write this as $G(x) = P(0) + P(1) x + P(2) x^2 + \cdots$.

Using the recurrence relation, we can rewrite this as $G(x) = 1 + x + 2x^2 + 3x^3 + \cdots$.

This is a geometric series, and we know that the sum of a geometric series is $a/(1-r)$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. In this case, $a = 1$ and $r = x$, so the sum is $1/(1-x)$.

So, we have $G(x) = 1/(1-x)$.

We can now find $P(n)$ by evaluating $G(x)$ at $x = 1$. This gives us $P(n) = \binom{n+1}{2}$.

Therefore, there are $\binom{n+1}{2}$ subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} with no two successive numbers.</code></pre>
