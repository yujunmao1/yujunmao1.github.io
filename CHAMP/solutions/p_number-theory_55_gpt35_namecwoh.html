<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: square of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to expand the square of a binomial expression. It is derived from the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the square of their sum and the square of their difference can be expressed as follows:

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Square of the sum:
To find the square of the sum of two numbers, a and b, we square each term individually and then add the cross product of the two terms. The formula (a + b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)
           = a(a + b) + b(a + b)
           = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2
           = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

2. Square of the difference:
To find the square of the difference between two numbers, a and b, we follow a similar process. The formula (a - b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a - b)
           = a(a - b) - b(a - b)
           = a^2 - ab - ba + b^2
           = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

The key difference between the two formulas is the sign of the cross product term. In the square of the sum formula, the cross product term is positive (+2ab), while in the square of the difference formula, the cross product term is negative (-2ab).

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to expand binomial expressions and work with them more easily.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and their remainders when divided by a fixed positive integer called the modulus. The concept of modular arithmetic is based on the idea that numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they exceed the modulus.

Modular arithmetic rules are a set of properties and operations that apply specifically to modular arithmetic. Here are some important rules:

1. Addition and Subtraction:
   - Addition Rule: (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n
   - Subtraction Rule: (a - b) mod n = (a mod n - b mod n) mod n

   These rules state that when adding or subtracting two numbers in modular arithmetic, you can perform the operation on each number separately, and then take the modulus of the result.

2. Multiplication:
   - Multiplication Rule: (a * b) mod n = (a mod n * b mod n) mod n

   This rule states that when multiplying two numbers in modular arithmetic, you can perform the operation on each number separately, and then take the modulus of the result.

3. Exponentiation:
   - Exponentiation Rule: (a^k) mod n = [(a mod n)^k] mod n

   This rule states that when raising a number to a power in modular arithmetic, you can take the modulus of the base number, raise it to the power, and then take the modulus of the result.

4. Division:
   - Division Rule: There is no direct division rule in modular arithmetic. Division is not always well-defined in modular arithmetic, as there may not be a unique solution. However, modular inverses can be used to solve certain division problems.

These rules are fundamental in modular arithmetic and are used to simplify calculations, solve equations, and analyze patterns in modular systems. They allow us to perform operations on numbers within a specific modulus, which is particularly useful in cryptography, number theory, and computer science.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 4?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For odd x, x^2 mod 8=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine how many of the three numbers (x, y, z) must be divisible by 4, we can analyze the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible remainders when an integer is divided by 4:

- If a number is divisible by 4, its remainder is 0.
- If a number leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, it can be written as 4k + 1, where k is an integer.
- If a number leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, it can be written as 4k + 2.
- If a number leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, it can be written as 4k + 3.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2:

1. If both x and y are odd:
   - According to the given information, for odd x, x^2 mod 8 = 1.
   - Therefore, x^2 mod 8 = 1^2 mod 8 = 1.
   - Similarly, y^2 mod 8 = 1.
   - So, x^2 + y^2 mod 8 = 1 + 1 mod 8 = 2.
   - Since 2 is not divisible by 4, neither x nor y can be divisible by 4.

2. If one of x or y is odd and the other is even:
   - Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume x is odd and y is even.
   - According to the given information, for odd x, x^2 mod 8 = 1.
   - Therefore, x^2 mod 8 = 1^2 mod 8 = 1.
   - Since y is even, y^2 mod 8 = 0.
   - So, x^2 + y^2 mod 8 = 1 + 0 mod 8 = 1.
   - Again, 1 is not divisible by 4, so neither x nor y can be divisible by 4.

3. If both x and y are even:
   - Let&#x27;s assume x = 2a and y = 2b, where a and b are integers.
   - Substituting these values into the equation, we get (2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = z^2.
   - Simplifying, we have 4(a^2 + b^2) = z^2.
   - This implies that z^2 is divisible by 4.
   - Therefore, at least one of x, y, or z must be divisible by 4.

In conclusion, at least one of the three numbers (x, y, z) must be divisible by 4.</code></pre>
