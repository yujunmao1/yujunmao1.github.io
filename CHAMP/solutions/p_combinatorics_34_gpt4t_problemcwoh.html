<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We define P(k) as the number of strings with k number of 1s, so P(k)=C(n, k)*3^(n-k).
2. Thus, the number of length-n strings with an even number of 1s is E(n)=P(0)+P(2)+...=C(n, 0)*3^n+C(n, 2)*3^(n-2)....
3. The number of length-n strings with an odd number of 1s is O(n)=P(1)+P(3)+...=C(n, 1)*3^(n-1)+C(n, 3)*3^(n-3)....
4. We have E(n)+O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*1^k=(3+1)^n=4^n.
5. In addition, E(n)-O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*(-1)^k=(3-1)^n=2^n.
6. Thus, E(n)=(4^n+2^n)/2.

Problem: Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let x_n, y_n, z_n be the number of length-n strings that end with digit 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. Thus, we have x_1=y_1=z_1=1.
3. For a string ending with 1, we can append 1 and 2; for a string ending with 2, we can append 1, 2 and 3; for a string ending with 3, we can append 2 and 3.
4. Thus, we have x_(n+1)=x_n+y_n, y_(n+1)=x_n+y_n+z_n, and z_(n+1)=y_n+z_n.
5. Starting from (1, 1, 1), we have the sequence of (x_n, y_n, z_n) to be (1, 1, 1), (2, 3, 2), (5, 7, 5), (12, 17, 12), (29, 41, 29), (70, 99, 70).
6. Thus, in total, there are x_6+y_6+z_6=70+99+70=239 such strings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of partitions of the integer n that include the integer k at least once. A partition of an integer is a way of writing the integer as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the addends does not matter.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of times k appears in all partitions of n as T(n, k). To find T(n, k), we can use a combinatorial argument.

First, we partition the integer n into two parts: k and n-k. Now, we need to count the number of partitions of n-k that can be combined with k to form a partition of n. However, since we are interested in the number of times k appears, we need to consider that k can appear more than once in the partition of n.

Let&#x27;s consider the partitions of n-k and how we can add k to them:

1. If a partition of n-k does not contain k, we can simply add k to this partition, and k will appear once.
2. If a partition of n-k already contains k, then adding another k will increase the count of k&#x27;s in that partition.

To count the partitions of n-k, we can use the stars and bars method. However, since we are not interested in the actual partitions but rather the count of k&#x27;s, we need to modify our approach.

For each partition of n-k, we can add k to it in exactly one way, so the number of times k appears in the partitions of n-k is equal to the number of partitions of n-k.

The number of partitions of an integer is a complex problem, and there is no simple formula for it. However, we can use generating functions to find a recurrence relation for the number of partitions. The generating function for the number of partitions of an integer is given by the infinite product:

P(x) = (1/(1-x)) * (1/(1-x^2)) * (1/(1-x^3)) * ...

But this approach is not practical for our problem, as we are not asked for the number of partitions but rather the count of k&#x27;s in all partitions.

Since the problem is asking for an expression involving n and k, and given the complexity of partition functions, it&#x27;s likely that a simple closed-form expression may not exist or the problem might be misstated or incomplete.

If we had a function p(m) that gives the number of partitions of m, then we could say that T(n, k) is at least p(n-k), since we can add k to each partition of n-k. However, this would only count the partitions where k appears exactly once. To count all appearances of k, we would need to consider partitions of n-k, n-2k, n-3k, and so on, where k appears 1, 2, 3, ... times, respectively.

Without additional constraints or a more specific problem statement, we cannot provide a simple expression for T(n, k). The problem of counting the number of times a number appears in all partitions of an integer is related to partition theory, which is a deep and complex area of number theory.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of times the number k appears in all partitions of the integer n is a complex problem in partition theory without a simple closed-form expression, and it generally requires considering all partitions of n-k, n-2k, n-3k, etc., to account for multiple appearances of k.</code></pre>
