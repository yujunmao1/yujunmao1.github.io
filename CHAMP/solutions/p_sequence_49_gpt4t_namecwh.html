<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The tangent angle sum identity is a trigonometric identity that expresses the tangent of the sum of two angles in terms of the tangents of the individual angles. The identity is as follows:

tan(α + β) = (tan(α) + tan(β)) / (1 - tan(α)tan(β))

This identity allows you to find the tangent of the sum of two angles if you know the tangents of those two angles individually. It is derived from the sine and cosine angle sum identities, which are:

sin(α + β) = sin(α)cos(β) + cos(α)sin(β)
cos(α + β) = cos(α)cos(β) - sin(α)sin(β)

Since tan(α) = sin(α)/cos(α), we can use these identities to derive the tangent angle sum identity:

tan(α + β) = sin(α + β) / cos(α + β)
            = (sin(α)cos(β) + cos(α)sin(β)) / (cos(α)cos(β) - sin(α)sin(β))
            = [(sin(α)/cos(α)) + (sin(β)/cos(β))] / [1 - (sin(α)/cos(α))(sin(β)/cos(β))]
            = (tan(α) + tan(β)) / (1 - tan(α)tan(β))

This identity is particularly useful in solving trigonometric equations, simplifying expressions, and proving other trigonometric identities. It is also a fundamental tool in calculus for finding the derivatives of the tangent function and for integrating functions involving tangent.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: tangent sum-to-product formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The tangent sum-to-product formula is a trigonometric identity that allows you to rewrite the sum or difference of two tangent functions as a product of tangents. This formula is useful for simplifying trigonometric expressions and solving equations. The sum-to-product formulas for tangent are derived from the sum-to-product identities for sine and cosine.

The sum-to-product formulas for tangent are as follows:

1. For the sum of two tangents:
tan(A) + tan(B) = (sin(A + B)) / (cos(A)cos(B))

2. For the difference of two tangents:
tan(A) - tan(B) = (sin(A - B)) / (cos(A)cos(B))

These formulas can be derived from the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine, along with the definition of tangent in terms of sine and cosine (tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x)).

Let&#x27;s derive the sum-to-product formula for the sum of two tangents:

Starting with the sum of two tangents:
tan(A) + tan(B)

We know that:
tan(A) = sin(A)/cos(A)
tan(B) = sin(B)/cos(B)

So we can write:
tan(A) + tan(B) = sin(A)/cos(A) + sin(B)/cos(B)

To combine these into a single fraction, we find a common denominator:
tan(A) + tan(B) = (sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B)) / (cos(A)cos(B))

Now, we recognize the numerator as the sine of the sum of two angles (from the sine sum formula):
sin(A + B) = sin(A)cos(B) + cos(A)sin(B)

Therefore, we can write:
tan(A) + tan(B) = sin(A + B) / (cos(A)cos(B))

This gives us the sum-to-product formula for the sum of two tangents.

The derivation for the difference of two tangents is similar, using the sine difference formula:
sin(A - B) = sin(A)cos(B) - cos(A)sin(B)

So for the difference, we have:
tan(A) - tan(B) = sin(A - B) / (cos(A)cos(B))

These sum-to-product formulas are not as commonly used as other trigonometric identities, but they can be helpful in certain contexts, such as integrating certain types of trigonometric functions or simplifying complex trigonometric expressions.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The sequence {x_n} is defined by x_1=2, x_(n+1)=(2+x_n)/(1−2x_n), and it is known that there are no x_n=0. Could x_p=x_q for any p≠q, and if so, find the smallest possible value of p+q.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a=arctan(2) and find the relationship between x_n and tan(na).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will first establish the relationship between \( x_n \) and \( \tan(na) \), where \( a = \arctan(2) \). We are given that \( x_1 = 2 \), which means that \( x_1 = \tan(a) \) since \( \arctan(2) \) is the angle whose tangent is 2.

Now, let&#x27;s assume that \( x_n = \tan(na) \) for some \( n \). We want to show that \( x_{n+1} = \tan((n+1)a) \) using the recursive formula provided:

\[ x_{n+1} = \frac{2 + x_n}{1 - 2x_n} \]

Using the tangent addition formula, we have:

\[ \tan((n+1)a) = \tan(na + a) = \frac{\tan(na) + \tan(a)}{1 - \tan(na)\tan(a)} \]

Since \( \tan(a) = 2 \), we can substitute \( \tan(na) \) with \( x_n \) and \( \tan(a) \) with 2 into the tangent addition formula:

\[ \tan((n+1)a) = \frac{x_n + 2}{1 - 2x_n} \]

This matches the recursive formula for \( x_{n+1} \), so by induction, we can conclude that \( x_n = \tan(na) \) for all \( n \).

Now, we want to find if there are any \( p \neq q \) such that \( x_p = x_q \). Since \( x_n = \tan(na) \), we are looking for angles \( na \) and \( ma \) that differ by an integer multiple of \( \pi \) because the tangent function has a period of \( \pi \). In other words, we want to find the smallest \( p \) and \( q \) such that:

\[ \tan(pa) = \tan(qa) \]
\[ pa - qa = k\pi \]
\[ (p - q)a = k\pi \]

where \( k \) is an integer. Since \( a = \arctan(2) \), it is not a rational multiple of \( \pi \), so \( p - q \) must be an integer multiple of the period of the tangent function for the equality to hold.

The smallest non-zero integer multiple of \( \pi \) is \( \pi \) itself, so we set \( k = 1 \) and get:

\[ (p - q)a = \pi \]

Since \( a \) is not a rational multiple of \( \pi \), \( p - q \) must be 1 for the smallest possible value. Therefore, we have:

\[ pa - (p-1)a = a = \pi \]

But this is not possible because \( a \) is not equal to \( \pi \). Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer \( k \) such that \( (p - q)a = k\pi \) holds true.

Given that \( a \) is an irrational multiple of \( \pi \), the smallest \( k \) that allows \( p \) and \( q \) to be integers is \( k = 1 \). This means that \( p - q \) must be the smallest integer such that \( (p - q)a \) is an integer multiple of \( \pi \). Since \( a \) is irrational, \( p - q \) must be large enough to &quot;cycle through&quot; the tangent function&#x27;s period until it coincides with an angle whose tangent is the same as \( \tan(a) \).

To find the smallest \( p + q \), we need to consider the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function has a period of \( \pi \), so we are looking for the smallest \( p \) and \( q \) such that:

\[ \tan(pa) = \tan(qa) \]
\[ pa = qa + k\pi \]

for some integer \( k \). Since \( a \) is not a rational multiple of \( \pi \), the only way for \( pa \) and \( qa \) to differ by an integer multiple of \( \pi \) is if \( p - q \) is an integer multiple of the period of the tangent function.

Let&#x27;s set \( p = q + k \), where \( k \) is the smallest positive integer such that \( (q + k)a - qa = ka \) is an integer multiple of \( \pi \). Since \( a \) is an irrational multiple of \( \pi \), the smallest such \( k \) is actually the denominator of the rational approximation of \( a/\pi \) when expressed in lowest terms.

However, without additional information about the exact value of \( a \) in terms of \( \pi \), we cannot determine the specific integers \( p \) and \( q \). We can only conclude that \( p \) and \( q \) must be chosen such that \( p - q \) is a multiple of the period of the tangent function, and \( p + q \) will be minimized when \( k \) is minimized.

In summary, without a precise relationship between \( a \) and \( \pi \), we cannot find the exact smallest values of \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfy \( x_p = x_q \). However, we can say that such \( p \) and \( q \) exist if \( p - q \) is a multiple of the period of the tangent function, and the smallest \( p + q \) will occur for the smallest such multiple.</code></pre>
