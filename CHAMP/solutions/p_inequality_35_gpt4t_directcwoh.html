For how many values of n in {101, ..., 1000} is 1/(n+1)+1/(n+2)+...+1/(2n)&lt;3/4?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can start by examining the sum and looking for patterns or ways to estimate it. The sum in question is:

S(n) = 1/(n+1) + 1/(n+2) + ... + 1/(2n)

This is a sum of n terms, and each term is a fraction with a denominator between n+1 and 2n. We can notice that each term is less than 1/n (since n+1 &gt; n, n+2 &gt; n, ..., 2n &gt; n), so we can write:

S(n) &lt; n * (1/n) = 1

This tells us that the sum is less than 1 for all n, but we need to find out for how many n it is less than 3/4.

To get a better estimate, we can compare the sum to an integral. The function 1/x is decreasing, and each term 1/(n+k) in the sum can be seen as an approximation for the area under 1/x from n+k to n+k+1. This means that the sum S(n) is an approximation for the integral of 1/x from n+1 to 2n+1:

∫(from n+1 to 2n+1) 1/x dx

This integral can be evaluated as the natural logarithm:

∫(from n+1 to 2n+1) 1/x dx = ln(x) | (from n+1 to 2n+1) = ln(2n+1) - ln(n+1)

Now, we want to find when this integral is less than 3/4. We can use the inequality:

ln(2n+1) - ln(n+1) &lt; 3/4

Using properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms:

ln((2n+1)/(n+1)) &lt; 3/4

Exponentiating both sides to remove the logarithm, we get:

(2n+1)/(n+1) &lt; e^(3/4)

Now, we need to solve for n:

2n+1 &lt; e^(3/4) * (n+1)
2n+1 &lt; e^(3/4) * n + e^(3/4)

Rearrange the terms to isolate n:

2n - e^(3/4) * n &lt; e^(3/4) - 1
n * (2 - e^(3/4)) &lt; e^(3/4) - 1

Now, we divide by (2 - e^(3/4)) to solve for n, noting that since e^(3/4) is less than 2, the term (2 - e^(3/4)) is positive, so the inequality direction remains the same:

n &lt; (e^(3/4) - 1) / (2 - e^(3/4))

Now we can calculate the right-hand side using a calculator:

n &lt; (e^(3/4) - 1) / (2 - e^(3/4))
n &lt; (2.117 - 1) / (2 - 2.117)
n &lt; 1.117 / (-0.117)
n &lt; -9.55 (approximately)

Since n must be a positive integer, this result doesn&#x27;t make sense in our context. This suggests that our estimate might be too rough or that we&#x27;ve made a mistake. Let&#x27;s go back and check our work.

We have the inequality:

ln((2n+1)/(n+1)) &lt; 3/4

Exponentiating both sides:

(2n+1)/(n+1) &lt; e^(3/4)

We can see that as n increases, the fraction (2n+1)/(n+1) approaches 2, because the +1 becomes less significant. Since e^(3/4) is approximately 2.117, there will be a certain point where (2n+1)/(n+1) is less than e^(3/4), and for all larger n, the inequality will hold.

To find the exact value of n where the inequality starts to hold, we would need to test values of n starting from the smallest in the set {101, ..., 1000} and moving upwards until we find the smallest n for which the inequality holds. Then, we would count all the values from that n up to 1000.

However, this approach is quite tedious without a computer. Instead, let&#x27;s try to refine our estimate. We know that the sum S(n) is less than the integral, and we also know that the sum is greater than the integral from n to 2n:

∫(from n to 2n) 1/x dx = ln(x) | (from n to 2n) = ln(2n) - ln(n) = ln(2)

Since ln(2) is approximately 0.693, which is less than 3/4, we know that for all n, the sum S(n) is greater than ln(2). Therefore, we need to find the values of n for which the sum S(n) is between ln(2) and 3/4.

To find the exact values of n that satisfy the inequality, we would need to test individual values of n. However, we can make an educated guess that as n increases, the sum S(n) will decrease and approach ln(2) from above. Therefore, there will be a range of values of n for which S(n) is less than 3/4, starting from some minimum n and going up to 1000.

To find the exact number of values of n that satisfy the inequality, we would need to perform a more detailed analysis or use numerical methods. Without further tools, we cannot give an exact answer to the original question.</code></pre>
