A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

a_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^n)

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is positive, so adding another term to the sum will always make the sum larger. In other words, for all n in the natural numbers, a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

The sequence is also bounded above. Specifically, it is bounded by the sum of the infinite series:

S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...

This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1 is given by the formula S = a / (1 - r). In this case, the sum is:

S = 1 / (1 - 1/2) = 1 / (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the sequence (a_n) is bounded above by 2.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 2. So, we can say that:

lim (n -&gt; ∞) a_n = 2

This means that as n becomes very large, the value of a_n gets arbitrarily close to 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The statement &quot;For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y) if and only if x ≥ y&quot; is a property of square roots that holds true for all non-negative real numbers. Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example:

Let x = 16 and y = 9, which are both non-negative numbers.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the square roots of both numbers:

sqrt(x) = sqrt(16) = 4
sqrt(y) = sqrt(9) = 3

We can see that sqrt(x) = 4 is greater than sqrt(y) = 3. According to the property, this should mean that x is also greater than y. Indeed, we have:

x = 16 &gt; 9 = y

This example confirms the property: since sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y), it follows that x ≥ y. Conversely, because x ≥ y, we can also conclude that sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y). This is a bidirectional implication, meaning that one statement implies the other and vice versa, but it is important to note that this property only holds for non-negative values of x and y, as square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers (they are complex numbers).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Does the limit exist for the sequence defined by a_0=0, a_(n+1)=sqrt(6+a_n), and if so, find it.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the limit exists for the sequence defined by a_0 = 0 and a_(n+1) = sqrt(6 + a_n), we can first check if the sequence is monotonic and bounded.

**Monotonicity:**
We will prove by induction that the sequence is monotonically increasing.

Base case (n=0): a_0 = 0 and a_1 = sqrt(6 + a_0) = sqrt(6 + 0) = sqrt(6), so a_1 &gt; a_0.

Inductive step: Assume that a_n &gt; a_(n-1) for some n ≥ 1. We need to show that a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

Since a_n &gt; a_(n-1), we have:
6 + a_n &gt; 6 + a_(n-1)

Taking the square root of both sides (which preserves the inequality because both sides are non-negative):
sqrt(6 + a_n) &gt; sqrt(6 + a_(n-1))

By the definition of the sequence:
a_(n+1) &gt; a_n

Thus, by induction, the sequence is monotonically increasing.

**Boundedness:**
We will now show that the sequence is bounded above. Since a_0 = 0 and all subsequent terms are generated by adding 6 and taking a square root, all terms are non-negative. We also know that if the sequence has a limit L, then L must satisfy the recursive relation:

L = sqrt(6 + L)

Squaring both sides gives us:
L^2 = 6 + L

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:
L^2 - L - 6 = 0

Factoring the quadratic, we find:
(L - 3)(L + 2) = 0

This gives us two potential solutions for L: L = 3 or L = -2. However, since all terms of the sequence are non-negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, if the sequence has a limit, it must be L = 3.

Now, we need to show that the sequence is indeed bounded above by this limit. We will again use induction to prove that all terms of the sequence are less than or equal to 3.

Base case (n=0): a_0 = 0 ≤ 3.

Inductive step: Assume that a_n ≤ 3 for some n ≥ 0. We need to show that a_(n+1) ≤ 3.

Since a_n ≤ 3, we have:
6 + a_n ≤ 6 + 3 = 9

Taking the square root of both sides (which preserves the inequality because both sides are non-negative):
sqrt(6 + a_n) ≤ sqrt(9) = 3

By the definition of the sequence:
a_(n+1) ≤ 3

Thus, by induction, the sequence is bounded above by 3.

**Conclusion:**
Since the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it must have a limit. We have already established that if a limit L exists, it must satisfy L = sqrt(6 + L), which gives us L = 3. Therefore, the limit of the sequence exists and is equal to 3.

Final answer: The limit of the sequence (a_n) exists and is L = 3.</code></pre>
