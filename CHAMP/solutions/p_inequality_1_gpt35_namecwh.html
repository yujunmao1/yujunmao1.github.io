<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Vieta&#x27;s formula for quadratic equation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Vieta&#x27;s formula is a result in algebra that relates the coefficients of a quadratic equation to the sum and product of its roots. It is named after the French mathematician François Viète, who first discovered this relationship.

Consider a quadratic equation in the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and x represents the variable. The formula states that the sum of the roots, denoted as α and β, is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the linear term (b) divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term (a). In other words, α + β = -b/a.

Similarly, the product of the roots, denoted as αβ, is equal to the constant term (c) divided by the coefficient of the quadratic term (a). In other words, αβ = c/a.

These formulas hold true for any quadratic equation, whether it has real or complex roots. They provide a convenient way to find the sum and product of the roots without actually solving the equation.

For example, let&#x27;s consider the quadratic equation 2x^2 + 5x + 3 = 0. Using Vieta&#x27;s formulas, we can determine that the sum of the roots is -5/2 and the product of the roots is 3/2.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas have various applications in mathematics, including solving problems involving quadratic equations, finding relationships between the roots and coefficients, and even in other areas of mathematics such as complex analysis and number theory.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let x be a root of the polynomial ax^2+bx+c, with a&gt;0, a+b+c≥0, a-b+c≥0, a-c≥0. What is the range of x, expressed as an interval?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Express the last three inequality conditions in terms of the root x_1, x_2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the range of x, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem and express them in terms of the roots of the quadratic equation.

Let&#x27;s assume that x_1 and x_2 are the roots of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

1. a + b + c ≥ 0:
   Substituting x_1 and x_2 into the equation, we have:
   a(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + b(x_1 + x_2) + 2c ≥ 0
   Since a &gt; 0, we can divide the inequality by a:
   x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (b/a)(x_1 + x_2) + 2c/a ≥ 0

2. a - b + c ≥ 0:
   Substituting x_1 and x_2 into the equation, we have:
   a(x_1^2 + x_2^2) - b(x_1 + x_2) + 2c ≥ 0
   Since a &gt; 0, we can divide the inequality by a:
   x_1^2 + x_2^2 - (b/a)(x_1 + x_2) + 2c/a ≥ 0

3. a - c ≥ 0:
   Substituting x_1 and x_2 into the equation, we have:
   a(x_1^2 + x_2^2) + b(x_1 + x_2) - 2c ≥ 0
   Since a &gt; 0, we can divide the inequality by a:
   x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (b/a)(x_1 + x_2) - 2c/a ≥ 0

Now, let&#x27;s consider the range of x.

Since a &gt; 0, the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 opens upwards, meaning it has a minimum value. The minimum value occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is given by x = -b/2a.

Using Vieta&#x27;s formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is x_1 + x_2 = -b/a, and the product of the roots is x_1 * x_2 = c/a.

From the given conditions, we have:
a + b + c ≥ 0
a - b + c ≥ 0
a - c ≥ 0

Rearranging these inequalities, we get:
-b ≥ -a - c
b ≥ a - c
