<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r â‰  1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: transitivity of divisibility.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The transitivity of divisibility is a property in number theory that relates to the divisibility of integers. Divisibility is a concept where one integer, say a, can be divided by another integer, b, without leaving a remainder. In this case, we say that &quot;a is divisible by b,&quot; or equivalently, &quot;b divides a,&quot; which is denoted as b | a.

The transitivity of divisibility states that if we have three integers a, b, and c, and if a is divisible by b and b is divisible by c, then a is also divisible by c. In symbolic terms, if b | a and c | b, then c | a.

Here&#x27;s a more detailed explanation:

1. If b | a, then there exists an integer k such that a = bk.
2. If c | b, then there exists an integer m such that b = cm.

Now, if we substitute the second equation into the first, we get:

a = bk = (cm)k = c(mk)

Since mk is an integer (because the product of two integers is an integer), this shows that a is equal to c times some integer (mk), which means that c divides a, or c | a.

This property is fundamental in number theory and is used in various proofs and theorems. It&#x27;s a reflection of the transitive property that we see in other areas of mathematics, such as in relations, where if a relation holds from A to B and from B to C, it also holds from A to C.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Finding the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x), where p(x)=x^6+x^5+...+x+1?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let y=x^7 and study the divisibility of p(y)-p(1) by y-1.
2. For integer n, the polynomial x-y divides the polynomial x^n-y^n.
3. If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we will use the given information and the properties of divisibility of polynomials.

First, let&#x27;s consider the polynomial p(x) = x^6 + x^5 + ... + x + 1. We want to find the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x).

Let y = x^7. We are interested in p(y) - p(1) and its divisibility by y - 1.

p(y) = y^6 + y^5 + ... + y + 1
p(1) = 1^6 + 1^5 + ... + 1 + 1 = 7

Now, let&#x27;s compute p(y) - p(1):

p(y) - p(1) = (y^6 + y^5 + ... + y + 1) - 7
             = y^6 + y^5 + ... + y - 6

We know from the given information that for integer n, the polynomial x - y divides the polynomial x^n - y^n. This means that y - 1 divides y^n - 1^n for any integer n. Applying this to each term in p(y) - p(1), we get:

y - 1 divides y^6 - 1
y - 1 divides y^5 - 1
...
y - 1 divides y - 1

Since y - 1 divides each term y^k - 1 for k = 1 to 6, and by the property of divisibility (if d | a and d | b, then d | a + b), it follows that y - 1 divides the sum of these terms:

y - 1 divides (y^6 - 1) + (y^5 - 1) + ... + (y - 1)

Therefore, y - 1 divides p(y) - p(1), which is the sum we computed above:

y - 1 divides y^6 + y^5 + ... + y - 6

Now, let&#x27;s go back to the original variables:

y - 1 = x^7 - 1
p(y) - p(1) = x^42 + x^35 + ... + x^7 - 6

Since y - 1 divides p(y) - p(1), it follows that x^7 - 1 divides x^42 + x^35 + ... + x^7 - 6. This means that when p(x^7) is divided by p(x), the remainder is the same as when -6 is divided by p(x), because all the other terms are divisible by x^7 - 1, and p(x) = x^6 + x^5 + ... + x + 1 is a factor of x^7 - 1.

Therefore, the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x) is simply the remainder when -6 is divided by p(x). Since p(x) is a polynomial of degree 6 and -6 is a constant, the remainder is just -6.

Final answer: The remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x) is -6.</code></pre>
