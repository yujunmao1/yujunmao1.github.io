<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical expression that allows us to factorize a quadratic expression that is in the form of a difference between two perfect squares. It states that:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

In this formula, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; represent any real numbers or variables. The left side of the equation represents the difference between the squares of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, while the right side represents the factored form of the expression.

To understand why this formula works, let&#x27;s expand the right side of the equation:

(a + b)(a - b) = a(a) + a(-b) + b(a) + b(-b)
               = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

As you can see, the expanded form of the right side matches the left side of the equation, which confirms that the formula is correct.

The difference of squares formula is particularly useful when we encounter quadratic expressions that can be written as the difference between two perfect squares. By factoring the expression using this formula, we can simplify it and potentially solve equations or simplify further calculations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of powers formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>I apologize, but there is no specific concept known as the &quot;difference of powers formula.&quot; However, there are several formulas related to powers that you might be referring to. Here are a few commonly used formulas involving powers:

1. Power of a Product: (ab)^n = a^n * b^n
   This formula states that when a product is raised to a power, each factor within the product is raised to that power individually.

2. Power of a Power: (a^n)^m = a^(n * m)
   This formula states that when a power is raised to another power, we multiply the exponents.

3. Power of a Quotient: (a/b)^n = (a^n)/(b^n)
   This formula states that when a quotient is raised to a power, both the numerator and denominator are raised to that power individually.

4. Negative Exponent: a^(-n) = 1/(a^n)
   This formula states that when a number or variable is raised to a negative exponent, it is equivalent to the reciprocal of that number or variable raised to the positive exponent.

These are just a few examples of formulas involving powers. If you have a specific formula or concept in mind, please provide more details, and I will be happy to explain it to you.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.
2. If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.
3. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m, we can consider the product (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.

Let&#x27;s consider two cases:

Case 1: n is even
If n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are consecutive odd numbers. Since consecutive odd numbers are always co-prime, we can write:
(n-1)n(n+1) = (n-1) * n * (n+1) = b * c

Here, b = n-1 and c = n+1. Since b and c are consecutive odd numbers, they are co-prime.

According to the second piece of information given, if gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1. Since b and c are co-prime, we can conclude that gcd(a, (n-1)n(n+1)) = 1.

Therefore, for any even value of n, there are no solutions to the equation.

Case 2: n is odd
If n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are consecutive even numbers. We can write:
(n-1)n(n+1) = (n-1) * n * (n+1) = b * c

Here, b = n-1 and c = n+1. Since b and c are consecutive even numbers, they are not co-prime. However, we can still factorize the product (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers by dividing out the common factor of 2.

Let&#x27;s rewrite the equation as:
2 * (b/2) * (c/2) = a^m

Now, we have two co-prime numbers (b/2) and (c/2) on the left side of the equation.

According to the third piece of information given, if ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a = u^k and b = v^k for gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = c.

In our case, (b/2) * (c/2) = a^m, so we can write:
(b/2) = u^m and (c/2) = v^m for gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = a

Now, we have two equations:
b = 2u^m and c = 2v^m

Since b = n-1 and c = n+1, we can substitute these values into the equations:
n-1 = 2u^m and n+1 = 2v^m

By subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
2 = 2v^m - 2u^m
1 = v^m - u^m

Now, we have an equation involving the difference of two powers. To find all possible solutions, we need to consider the cases where m is even and m is odd separately.

Case 2.1: m is even
If m is even, then v^m and u^m are both perfect squares. Let&#x27;s write:
v^m = x^2 and u^m = y^2

Now, we have:
1 = x^2 - y^2
1 = (x+y)(x-y)

Since 1 is a prime number, the only possible values are:
x+y = 1 and x-y = 1
Solving these equations, we get x = 1 and y = 0.

Substituting these values back into the equations v^m = x^2 and u^m = y^2, we get:
v^m = 1 and u^m = 0

Since a = uv, we have a = 0, which contradicts the condition a &gt; 0. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Case 2.2: m is odd
If m is odd, then v^m and u^m are not perfect squares. In this case, we cannot find any integer solutions for the equation v^m - u^m = 1.

Therefore, there are no solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1.

In conclusion, there are no possible solutions to the given equation.</code></pre>
