<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

a+a*r+a*r^2+...+a*r^n=a(1-r^(n+1))/(1-r), a+a*r+a*r^2+...=a/(1-r).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a savings account with a balance of $100. You decide to invest the money in a savings account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. After one year, you will have $105 in your account. After two years, you will have $110.25 in your account. And so on.

The formula for calculating compound interest is $A = P(1 + r)^n$, where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the interest rate, and $n$ is the number of years.

In this example, $P = 100$, $r = 0.05$, and $n = 1$. So, the final amount after one year is $A = 100(1 + 0.05)^1 = 105$.

After two years, the final amount is $A = 100(1 + 0.05)^2 = 110.25$.

And so on.

You can see that the amount of money in your account is increasing at an exponential rate. This is because the interest you earn is also earning interest.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is $S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this example, $a_1 = 100$, $r = 0.05$, and $n = 2$. So, the sum of the first two terms is $S_2 = \frac{100(1 - 0.05^2)}{1 - 0.05} = 105.0625$.

The sum of the first three terms is $S_3 = \frac{100(1 - 0.05^3)}{1 - 0.05} = 110.2500625$.

And so on.

You can see that the sum of the terms is getting closer and closer to the final amount. This is because the terms are getting smaller and smaller.

The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is $S = \frac{a_1}{1-r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

In this example, $a_1 = 100$ and $r = 0.05$. So, the sum of the infinite geometric series is $S = \frac{100}{1 - 0.05} = 1000$.

This means that if you keep investing your money in this savings account for an infinite amount of time, you will eventually have $1000 in your account.

Of course, this is just a theoretical example. In reality, you would have to pay taxes on the interest you earn, and the value of your money would be eroded by inflation. But it still gives you a good idea of how compound interest can work to your advantage.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a rectangle with a length of $x$ and a width of $y$. The area of the rectangle is $x \times y$.

Now, let&#x27;s say you want to find the area of a square with the same perimeter as the rectangle. The perimeter of the rectangle is $2x + 2y$. The perimeter of the square is $4x$.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the side of the square:

$$x^2 + y^2 = (x)^2$$

$$x^2 - y^2 = 0$$

$$(x + y)(x - y) = 0$$

Since $x$ and $y$ are not both zero, we can divide both sides by $x - y$ to get:

$$x + y = 0$$

or

$$x - y = 0$$

This means that the length of the side of the square is either $x$ or $y$.

The area of the square is then $x^2$ or $y^2$.

In other words, the area of a square with the same perimeter as a rectangle is equal to the square of the length of one of the sides of the rectangle.</code></pre>

For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say $a=2$, $b=1$, and $n=3$. Then, $a^n-b^n=2^3-1^3=8-1=7$.

We can factor $7$ as $7=7\cdot1$. Since $7$ is a factor of $7$, and $7$ is a difference of two cubes, we know that $a-b$ divides $a^n-b^n$.

In general, if $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $n$ is a positive integer, then $a-b$ divides $a^n-b^n$.

Here is a proof of this statement:

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, and let $n$ be a positive integer. We will prove by induction that $a-b$ divides $a^n-b^n$.

The base case is $n=1$. In this case, $a^n-b^n=a-b$, so the statement is true.

Now, assume that the statement is true for some positive integer $k$. That is, assume that $a-b$ divides $a^k-b^k$. We want to show that $a-b$ divides $a^{k+1}-b^{k+1}$.

We have:

$$a^{k+1}-b^{k+1}=(a^k+b^k)(a-b)$$

Since $a-b$ divides $a^k-b^k$, and $a^k+b^k$ is an integer, we know that $a-b$ divides $a^{k+1}-b^{k+1}$.

This completes the inductive step. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all positive integers $n$.</code></pre>

We can factor $9$ as $9=3\cdot3$. Since $3$ is a factor of $9$, and $9$ is a sum of two cubes, we know that $a+b$ divides $a^n+b^n$.

In general, if $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $n$ is an odd positive integer, then $a+b$ divides $a^n+b^n$.

Here is a proof of this statement:

Let $a$ and $b$ be integers, and let $n$ be an odd positive integer. We will prove by induction that $a+b$ divides $a^n+b^n$.

The base case is $n=1$. In this case, $a^n+b^n=a+b$, so the statement is true.

Now, assume that the statement is true for some odd positive integer $k$. That is, assume that $a+b$ divides $a^k+b^k$. We want to show that $a+b$ divides $a^{k+1}+b^{k+1}$.

We have:

$$a^{k+1}+b^{k+1}=(a^k+b^k)(a+b)-ab(a^{k-1}-b^{k-1})$$

Since $a+b$ divides $a^k+b^k$, and $ab(a^{k-1}-b^{k-1})$ is an integer, we know that $a+b$ divides $a^{k+1}+b^{k+1}$.

This completes the inductive step. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all odd positive integers $n$.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Are there prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). If so, what is the smallest one?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. 10001=73*137.
2. For even n, let n+1=m and factorize the expression for a_n.
3. For odd n, let n+1=2k and factorize the expression for a_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Yes, there are prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). The smallest one is 10000000073.

To prove this, we will first show that every number in the sequence is divisible by 73. Then, we will show that there is at least one number in the sequence that is not divisible by any other prime number less than 73.

Let $n$ be any positive integer. Then, $a_n$ can be written as follows:

$$a_n = 10001\cdot 10001^{n-1} = (73\cdot 137)\cdot 10001^{n-1} = 73\cdot 137\cdot 10001^{n-1}$$

Since 73 and 137 are prime numbers, and 10001 is divisible by both 73 and 137, we know that $a_n$ is divisible by 73.

Now, let $p$ be any prime number less than 73. Then, $p$ cannot divide $a_n$, since $a_n$ is not divisible by any prime number less than 73.

Therefore, there is at least one number in the sequence that is not divisible by any other prime number less than 73. This number must be prime.

The smallest number in the sequence that is not divisible by any other prime number less than 73 is 10000000073. Therefore, 10000000073 is the smallest prime number in the sequence {a_n}.</code></pre>
