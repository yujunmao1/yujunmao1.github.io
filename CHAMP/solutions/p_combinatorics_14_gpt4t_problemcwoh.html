<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. First, we&#x27;ll calculate the total number of ways to plant the trees without any restrictions, and then we&#x27;ll subtract the number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to plant the trees without any restrictions.
Since there are 3 apple trees (A), 3 peach trees (P), and 2 cherry trees (C), we have a total of 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 trees to plant. However, the trees of the same kind are indistinguishable among themselves. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange these trees is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) 

Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other.
We can treat a pair of apple trees as a single entity. Let&#x27;s denote this pair as AA.

a) Two apple trees together (AA), one apple tree separate (A):
We have 7 entities to arrange now: AA, A, P, P, P, C, C. The number of arrangements is:
7! / (3! * 2!) (since we have 3 Ps and 2 Cs)

However, there are 3 ways to choose which two of the three apple trees are in the pair AA, so we need to multiply by 3:

Number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together = 3 * (7! / (3! * 2!))

b) All three apple trees together (AAA):
Now we have 6 entities to arrange: AAA, P, P, P, C, C. The number of arrangements is:
6! / (3! * 2!)

Step 3: Subtract the number of restricted arrangements from the total number of arrangements to find the number of valid arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other.

Valid arrangements = Total arrangements - (Number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together + Number of arrangements with all three apple trees together)

Step 4: Calculate the probability by dividing the number of valid arrangements by the total number of arrangements.

Probability = Valid arrangements / Total arrangements

Now let&#x27;s compute these values:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 40320 / (6 * 6 * 2) = 40320 / 72 = 560

Number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together = 3 * (7! / (3! * 2!)) = 3 * (5040 / (6 * 2)) = 3 * (5040 / 12) = 3 * 420 = 1260

Number of arrangements with all three apple trees together = 6! / (3! * 2!) = 720 / (6 * 2) = 720 / 12 = 60

Valid arrangements = 560 - (1260 + 60) = 560 - 1320 = -760

However, we have a negative number of valid arrangements, which is not possible. This indicates that we have double-counted some arrangements where both two apple trees are together and all three are together. We need to add back the overcounted arrangements.

The overcounted arrangements are those where we have considered the pair AA and the single A as a block AAA, which we have already counted in the case where all three apple trees are together. Since there are 3 ways to choose the pair AA, we have overcounted this arrangement 3 times.

Overcounted arrangements = 3 * (Number of arrangements with all three apple trees together) = 3 * 60 = 180

Now we correct the valid arrangements:

Valid arrangements = 560 - (1260 - 180) = 560 - 1080 = -520

Again, we have a negative number, which indicates a mistake in our calculations. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate our steps.

The mistake is in the overcounting correction. We should not multiply the number of arrangements with all three apple trees together by 3, because there is only one way to group all three apple trees together, not three. So the overcounted arrangements are simply equal to the number of arrangements with all three apple trees together:

Overcounted arrangements = Number of arrangements with all three apple trees together = 60

Now we correct the valid arrangements:

Valid arrangements = 560 - (1260 + 60 - 60) = 560 - 1260 = -700

We still have a negative number, which indicates another mistake. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate our steps again.

The mistake is in the calculation of the number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together. We should not multiply by 3 for the choice of the pair AA because we are treating any two apple trees as a single entity AA, and it doesn&#x27;t matter which two we choose. So the number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together is simply:

Number of arrangements with a pair of apple trees together = 7! / (3! * 2!) = 5040 / (6 * 2) = 5040 / 12 = 420

Now we correct the valid arrangements:

Valid arrangements = 560 - (420 + 60) = 560 - 480 = 80

Finally, we calculate the probability:

Probability = Valid arrangements / Total arrangements = 80 / 560 = 1 / 7

So the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is 1/7.</code></pre>
