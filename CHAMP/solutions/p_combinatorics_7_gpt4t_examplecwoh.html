<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can consider the possible moves for each child. Each child has three options:

1. Stay in the original seat.
2. Move one seat to the left (except for the child in the first seat, who can&#x27;t move left).
3. Move one seat to the right (except for the child in the last seat, who can&#x27;t move right).

Let&#x27;s denote the number of ways the i-th child can move as p_i. For the children in the middle seats (seats 2 through 10), each has 3 options (stay, move left, move right), so p_i = 3 for i = 2, 3, ..., 10. For the children at the ends (seats 1 and 11), each has only 2 options (stay or move one seat away from the end), so p_1 = p_11 = 2.

Now, we need to consider the constraints. If a child moves to the left, the child originally to the left cannot move to the right, and vice versa. This means that not all combinations of moves are possible. We need to count the arrangements without violating this constraint.

Let&#x27;s break it down into cases:

1. No child moves: There is 1 way for this to happen.

2. Exactly one child moves: This can happen in two ways for each child except the first and last. The first and last child can move only one way (inward). So we have 2 ways for each of the 9 middle children, and 1 way each for the first and last child. This gives us 9*2 + 1 + 1 = 19 ways.

3. Two adjacent children move towards each other: There are 10 pairs of adjacent seats, and for each pair, there is 1 way this can happen (both children move towards each other). So this gives us 10 ways.

4. Two non-adjacent children move: One moves left, and the other moves right. There are 9 choices for the child moving left (not including the first child), and for each of these, there are 9 choices for the child moving right (not including the last child). However, we must subtract the cases where the children would end up in the same seat, which is 8 cases (since they can&#x27;t both move to the middle seat). So we have 9*9 - 8 = 81 - 8 = 73 ways.

Adding up all the cases, we get the total number of possible rearrangements:

Total ways = 1 (no child moves) + 19 (exactly one child moves) + 10 (two adjacent children move towards each other) + 73 (two non-adjacent children move)
Total ways = 1 + 19 + 10 + 73
Total ways = 103

So there are 103 possible rearrangements, including the original one.</code></pre>
