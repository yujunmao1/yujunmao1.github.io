<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many subsets of {1, 2,..., 10} have no two successive numbers?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider a string of 0s and 1s, where a digit 1 at i-th place means that i is included in the subset. Find the constraint on the string.
2. Let P(n) be the number of such strings of length n and express P(n) as P(n-1) and P(n-2).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the concept of strings of 0s and 1s to represent subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., 10}. A 1 at the i-th place means that the number i is included in the subset, and a 0 means that it is not included. The constraint on the string is that no two 1s can be adjacent, as this would correspond to having two successive numbers in the subset.

Let&#x27;s define P(n) as the number of such strings of length n that satisfy the constraint. We want to find P(10), since our set has 10 elements.

To build up to P(10), let&#x27;s consider smaller cases:

- P(1): There are two possible strings, &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;. So P(1) = 2.
- P(2): There are three possible strings, &quot;00&quot;, &quot;01&quot;, and &quot;10&quot;. The string &quot;11&quot; is not allowed because it has two successive 1s. So P(2) = 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider P(n) for n &gt; 2. To construct a valid string of length n, we can consider two cases for the last digit:

1. If the last digit is a 0, then the preceding part of the string (of length n-1) can be any valid string of length n-1. There are P(n-1) such strings.
2. If the last digit is a 1, then the second-to-last digit must be a 0 to avoid two successive 1s. This means the preceding part of the string (up to the second-to-last digit) can be any valid string of length n-2. There are P(n-2) such strings.

Therefore, we can express P(n) as the sum of P(n-1) and P(n-2):

P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2)

Using this recursive relationship, we can find P(10):

- P(3) = P(2) + P(1) = 3 + 2 = 5
- P(4) = P(3) + P(2) = 5 + 3 = 8
- P(5) = P(4) + P(3) = 8 + 5 = 13
- P(6) = P(5) + P(4) = 13 + 8 = 21
- P(7) = P(6) + P(5) = 21 + 13 = 34
- P(8) = P(7) + P(6) = 34 + 21 = 55
- P(9) = P(8) + P(7) = 55 + 34 = 89
- P(10) = P(9) + P(8) = 89 + 55 = 144

So, there are P(10) = 144 subsets of {1, 2, ..., 10} that contain no two successive numbers.</code></pre>
