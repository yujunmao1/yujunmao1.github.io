<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For how many values of n in {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} can f(x)=x^n+5x^(n−1)+3 be written as g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are both polynomials of integer coefficients with degree at least 1?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let f(x)=a_n*x^n+a_(n-1)*x^(n-1)+...+a_0 such that a_0=3, a_(n-1)=5, a_n=1, and all other a_i=0.
2. Let g(x)=b_m*x^m+b_(m-1)*x^(m-1)+...+b_0 and h(x)=c_(n-m)*x^(n-m)+c_(n-m-1)*x^(n-m-1)+...+c_0 be the two candidate polynomials.
3. Thus, we have b_0*c_0=a_0=3, and for integer b_0, c_0, assume without loss of generality that |b_0|=3 and |c_0|=1.
4. Let i be the smallest number such that 3 ∤ b_i (this b_i must exist because |b_m|=|c_(n-m)|=1).
5. Then a_i=b_i*c_0+b_(i-1)*c_1+b_(i-2)*c_2+...+b_0*c_i (or properly truncated if the degree of h(x) is less than i).
6. Since each b_(i-1), b_(i-2), ..., b_0 is divisible by 3, and b_i*c_0 is not divisible by 3, we have a_i not divisible by 3.
7. However, the smallest i with 3 ∤ a_i is i=n-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given the partial solution, we can continue the reasoning as follows:

7. However, the smallest i with 3 ∤ a_i is i=n-1, which means that for all j &lt; n-1, a_j must be divisible by 3. But since all a_j for j &lt; n-1 are 0 in our case, they are trivially divisible by 3.

8. Now, we have that a_(n-1) = 5, which is not divisible by 3. This means that the smallest i for which 3 ∤ a_i is indeed i = n-1.

9. Since b_i * c_0 is not divisible by 3, and a_(n-1) = 5, we must have b_i = ±5 and c_0 = ±1 (or vice versa, but the signs are not important for divisibility).

10. Now, we need to consider the highest degree terms. We have a_n = 1, which means that b_m * c_(n-m) = 1. Since both b_m and c_(n-m) are integers, we must have b_m = c_(n-m) = ±1.

11. We know that b_0 * c_0 = 3, and without loss of generality, we can take b_0 = 3 and c_0 = 1.

12. Now, we need to ensure that the polynomial can be factored into two polynomials with integer coefficients. For this to happen, all the coefficients of the polynomial must be integers when we multiply g(x) and h(x).

13. Since b_0 = 3 and c_0 = 1, we can start constructing the polynomials g(x) and h(x) by distributing the terms. However, we must ensure that the coefficients of x^k for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n-2 are divisible by 3, as they must be 0 in f(x).

14. The only way to ensure that all coefficients of x^k for 1 ≤ k ≤ n-2 are divisible by 3 is if all coefficients of g(x) and h(x), except for the leading coefficient and the constant term, are divisible by 3.

15. Since b_m = ±1 and b_0 = 3, all other b_i for 0 &lt; i &lt; m must be divisible by 3. Similarly, since c_(n-m) = ±1 and c_0 = 1, all other c_i for 0 &lt; i &lt; n-m must be divisible by 3.

16. The only way to satisfy this condition is if n-1 is divisible by 3, because then we can have g(x) = x^m + 3 and h(x) = x^(n-m) + 1, where m is some integer such that 1 ≤ m &lt; n.

17. Therefore, we need to count the number of values of n in {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} for which n-1 is divisible by 3.

18. The smallest value of n for which n-1 is divisible by 3 is 4 (since 4-1=3), and the largest value of n for which n-1 is divisible by 3 is 1993 (since 1993-1=1992, and 1992 is divisible by 3).

19. The numbers in the set {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} that satisfy this condition form an arithmetic sequence with the first term a_1 = 4 and common difference d = 3.

20. To find the number of terms in this sequence, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. We want to find the largest n such that a_n ≤ 1993.

21. Solving for n, we get n = (a_n - a_1)/d + 1. Substituting the values, we have n = (1993 - 4)/3 + 1 = 1989/3 + 1 = 663 + 1 = 664.

Therefore, there are 664 values of n in the set {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} for which the polynomial f(x) = x^n + 5x^(n−1) + 3 can be written as the product of two polynomials g(x) and h(x) with integer coefficients and degrees at least 1.</code></pre>
