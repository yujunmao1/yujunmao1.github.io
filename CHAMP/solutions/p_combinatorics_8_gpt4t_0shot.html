<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 5 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors (i.e., the string does not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach. We need to count the number of valid strings of length 5 that consist of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4, with the restriction that 1 and 2 cannot be adjacent.

Let&#x27;s break this down into cases based on the positions of the digits 1 and 2 in the string.

Case 1: The string contains no 1s or 2s.
In this case, we only have the digits 3 and 4 to use, and since there are no restrictions, there are 2 options for each of the 5 positions, giving us a total of 2^5 = 32 strings.

Case 2: The string contains 1s but no 2s.
Since there are no 2s, we can place 1s anywhere in the string without restriction. For each position in the string, we have 3 choices (1, 3, or 4), giving us a total of 3^5 = 243 strings.

Case 3: The string contains 2s but no 1s.
This case is symmetrical to Case 2. Again, we have 3 choices for each position, resulting in another 3^5 = 243 strings.

Case 4: The string contains both 1s and 2s, but they are not adjacent.
We need to count the number of strings where 1s and 2s are present but not next to each other. This is more complex, so let&#x27;s break it down further.

Subcase 4a: There is exactly one 1 and one 2 in the string.
There are 5 choices for the position of the 1, and once the 1 is placed, there are 4 remaining positions for the 2. However, we must subtract the position next to the 1, which leaves us with 3 valid positions for the 2. This gives us 5 * 3 = 15 possibilities for placing the 1 and 2. For the remaining 3 positions, we have 2 choices (3 or 4) for each, giving us 2^3 = 8 possibilities for each arrangement of 1 and 2. So, we have 15 * 8 = 120 strings for this subcase.

Subcase 4b: There is more than one 1 or more than one 2 in the string.
This subcase is more complex because we have to ensure that 1s and 2s are not adjacent. Let&#x27;s consider the different distributions of 1s and 2s:

- One 1 and two 2s: We can place the single 1 in any of the 5 positions. After placing the 1, we have 4 positions left for the two 2s. We can think of this as a &quot;stars and bars&quot; problem, where we have 2 stars (the 2s) and 3 bars (the positions between the remaining digits) to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these is the number of combinations of 2 stars chosen from 2 + 3 = 5 total positions, which is C(5,2) = 10. However, we must subtract the arrangements where the two 2s are adjacent to the 1, which are 4 cases (when the 1 is at either end or one position away from either end). This leaves us with 10 - 4 = 6 valid arrangements for the 1 and the two 2s. For the remaining 2 positions, we have 2 choices (3 or 4) for each, giving us 2^2 = 4 possibilities for each arrangement of 1 and 2s. So, we have 5 * 6 * 4 = 120 strings for this distribution.

- Two 1s and one 2: This is symmetrical to the previous distribution, so we also have 120 strings here.

Adding up all the cases, we get:
Case 1: 32 strings
Case 2: 243 strings
Case 3: 243 strings
Subcase 4a: 120 strings
Subcase 4b (one 1, two 2s): 120 strings
Subcase 4b (two 1s, one 2): 120 strings

Total number of strings = 32 + 243 + 243 + 120 + 120 + 120 = 878 strings

Therefore, there are 878 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that do not have any 1 and 2 as neighbors.</code></pre>
