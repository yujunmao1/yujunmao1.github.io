<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider two non-negative numbers, say 9 and 4. We will apply the concept to these numbers.

First, we take the square roots of both numbers:

sqrt(9) = 3
sqrt(4) = 2

Now, we compare the square roots:

3 (which is sqrt(9)) ≥ 2 (which is sqrt(4))

This inequality holds true. According to the concept, this should mean that the original numbers also satisfy the inequality:

9 ≥ 4

Since this is also true, the example confirms the concept that for non-negative x and y, sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y) if and only if x ≥ y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. An example of such a sequence is the sequence of the reciprocals of the natural numbers, starting from some positive integer n:

a_n = 1/(n+1), for n = 1, 2, 3, ...

This sequence can be written out as:

a_1 = 1/2, a_2 = 1/3, a_3 = 1/4, ..., a_n = 1/(n+1), ...

This sequence is monotonically increasing because as n gets larger, the denominator of the fraction gets larger, which means the value of the fraction gets smaller (since we&#x27;re dealing with positive numbers). Therefore, each term is less than or equal to the previous term:

a_n+1 ≤ a_n for all n.

The sequence is also bounded from above because all terms are less than or equal to the first term, which is 1/2. No term in the sequence will ever exceed 1/2, so we can say that the sequence is bounded above by 1/2.

According to the concept, since the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit of the sequence as n approaches infinity is 0. This is because as n becomes very large, the value of 1/(n+1) gets closer and closer to 0, but never negative or greater than 1/2. Thus, the limit of the sequence a_n = 1/(n+1) is:

lim (n→∞) a_n = 0

This example demonstrates the concept that a sequence which is monotonic and bounded has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What are possible values of the limit of the sequence a_n=sqrt(a_(n-1))+sqrt(a_(n-2)), for different initial values of 0&lt;a_0, a_1&lt;1, possibly as an expression of a_0, a_1?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence \( a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \) given the initial conditions \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \).

First, let&#x27;s note that since \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) are both positive and less than 1, the terms of the sequence will also be positive because they are sums of square roots of positive numbers. This means the sequence is bounded below by 0.

Next, we need to determine if the sequence is bounded above. Since \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) are both less than 1, their square roots are also less than 1. Therefore, the sum of their square roots is less than 2. This suggests that the sequence might be bounded above by 2, but we need to prove that this upper bound holds for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s assume that for all \( k &lt; n \), \( a_k &lt; 2 \). Then, for \( a_n \), we have:

\( a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \)

Since \( a_{n-1} &lt; 2 \) and \( a_{n-2} &lt; 2 \), their square roots are less than \( \sqrt{2} \). Therefore:

\( a_n &lt; \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2} \)

This shows that \( a_n \) is also less than \( 2\sqrt{2} \), which is less than 3. So, we can refine our upper bound to say that the sequence is bounded above by \( 2\sqrt{2} \).

Now, we have established that the sequence is bounded below by 0 and bounded above by \( 2\sqrt{2} \). We also need to show that the sequence is monotonic (either increasing or decreasing).

Let&#x27;s consider the first few terms of the sequence to see if we can determine a pattern:

\( a_2 = \sqrt{a_1} + \sqrt{a_0} \)

Since \( a_1 \) and \( a_0 \) are both less than 1, \( a_2 \) is greater than both \( a_1 \) and \( a_0 \). This suggests that the sequence might be increasing, at least initially.

For the sequence to be monotonically increasing, each term must be greater than or equal to the previous term. That is, \( a_n \geq a_{n-1} \) for all \( n \). However, without a specific functional form or additional information about the relationship between consecutive terms, we cannot definitively prove that the sequence is monotonically increasing for all \( n \).

Given the complexity of the recursive relationship and the lack of a clear monotonic behavior, finding an explicit expression for the limit of the sequence in terms of \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \) is not straightforward. The behavior of the sequence could depend sensitively on the initial values \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \), and without additional constraints or a more specific form, we cannot provide a general expression for the limit.

In conclusion, while we have established that the sequence is bounded, we cannot determine if it is monotonic or what the exact limit would be without additional information. The limit, if it exists, would depend on the specific values of \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \), and a more detailed analysis or numerical simulation might be necessary to find the limit for particular initial conditions.</code></pre>
