Problem: For positive integer n for which 2n+1 and 3n+1 are both perfect squares, what are possible values of n mod 40?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let x^2=2n+1 and y^2=3n+1.
2. Since 2n+1 is odd, x is odd and x^2 mod 8=1.
3. So 2n mod 8=0 and n is even because it is divisible by 4.
4. Thus, 3n+1 is odd and y is odd.
5. This means that y^2 mod 8=1 and 8 | 3n.
6. Since gcd(3,8)=1, we must have 8 | n, so n mod 8=0.
7. For modulo 5, we know that x^2 mod 5 is one of 0, 1 and 4.
8. Thus, n mod 5=0 leads to 2n+1 mod 5=3n+1 mod 5=1.
9. n mod 5=1 leads to 2n+1 mod 5=3 which is impossible.
10. n mod 5=2 leads to 3n+1 mod 5=2 which is impossible.
11. n mod 5=3 leads to 2n+1 mod 5=2 which is impossible.
12. n mod 5=4 leads to 3n+1 mod 5=3 which is impossible.
13. Thus, we have 5 | n and 8 | n.
14. Since gcd(5, 8)=1, we have 40 | n and n mod 40=0.

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 1971=27*73, we need 27 | 50^n+23^n*a and 73 | 50^n+23^n*a.
2. We have 50^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n*(a+1) mod 27=0.
3. In addition, for odd n, we have 50^n+23^n*a mod 73=(-23)^n+23^n*a mod 73=23^n*(a-1) mod 73=0.
4. Since gcd(27, 23)=gcd(73, 23)=1, we must have gcd(27, 23^n)=gcd(73, 23^n)=1, so 27 | a+1 and 73 | a-1.
5. In other words, a mod 27=-1 and a mod 73=1.
6. Thus, a=27x-1=73y+1 and 27 | 73y+2.
7. We have 73 mod 27=19, so the sequence of 73y+2 mod 27, starting for y=1, 2, 3, ... is 21, 13, 5, 24, 16, 8, 0.
8. We have 27 | 73y+2 for y=7, and a=73y+2=512.
9. Thus, a=512.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation 19x^3-84y^2=1984.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation 19x^3 - 84y^2 = 1984, we can start by factoring out the common factor of 19:

19(x^3 - 4y^2) = 1984.

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 19:

x^3 - 4y^2 = 104.

Next, we can rewrite the equation as:

x^3 = 4y^2 + 104.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo 4. Since any perfect square is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo 4, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1: y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 4)
In this case, y must be even, so let y = 2k, where k is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

x^3 = 4(2k)^2 + 104,
x^3 = 16k^2 + 104,
x^3 = 8(2k^2 + 13).

Since 8 is a perfect cube, we can let x = 2m, where m is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(2m)^3 = 8(2k^2 + 13),
8m^3 = 8(2k^2 + 13),
m^3 = 2k^2 + 13.

This equation implies that m^3 is odd, which means m is odd. Let m = 2n + 1, where n is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(2n + 1)^3 = 2k^2 + 13,
8n^3 + 12n^2 + 6n + 1 = 2k^2 + 13,
4n^3 + 6n^2 + 3n + 6 = k^2.

This equation implies that k^2 is even, which means k is even. Let k = 2p, where p is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

4n^3 + 6n^2 + 3n + 6 = (2p)^2,
4n^3 + 6n^2 + 3n + 6 = 4p^2,
n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + (3/2) = p^2.

This equation implies that p^2 is odd, which means p is odd. Let p = 2q + 1, where q is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + (3/2) = (2q + 1)^2,
n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + (3/2) = 4q^2 + 4q + 1,
n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + 1/2 = 2q^2 + 2q.

This equation implies that q^2 is odd, which means q is odd. Let q = 2r + 1, where r is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + 1/2 = 2(2r + 1)^2 + 2(2r + 1),
n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n + 1/2 = 8r^2 + 8r + 4,
n^3 + (3/2)n^2 + (3/4)n - 8r^2 - 8r - 7/2 = 0.

This equation is a cubic equation in n. To find its integer solutions, we can use various methods such as factoring, synthetic division, or numerical methods. However, in this case, we can observe that n = -1 is a solution. Dividing the cubic equation by (n + 1), we get:

n^2 + (1/2)n - 8r^2 - 8r - 7/2 = 0.

Now, we can use the quadratic formula to solve for n:

n = (-1/4) ± √[(1/4)^2 + 8r^2 + 8r + 7/2].

Since n must be an integer, the discriminant [(1/4)^2 + 8r^2 + 8r + 7/2] must be a perfect square. Let&#x27;s denote it as m^2, where m is an integer. We can rewrite the equation as:

[(1/4)^2 + 8r^2 + 8r + 7/2] = m^2,
1/16 + 8r^2 + 8r + 7/2 = m^2,
8r^2 + 8r + 121/16 = m^2,
128r^2 + 128r + 1936 = 16m^2,
(8r + 16)^2 + 1936 - 256 = 16m^2,
(8r + 16)^2 + 1680 = 16m^2,
(8r + 16)^2 = 16m^2 - 1680,
(8r + 16)^2 = 16(m^2 - 105).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo 16. Since any perfect square is congruent to either 0, 1, 4, or 9 modulo 16, we have four cases to consider:

Case 1: m^2 ≡ 0 (mod 16)
In this case, m must be even, so let m = 2s, where s is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(8r + 16)^2 = 16((2s)^2 - 105),
(8r + 16)^2 = 64s^2 - 1680,
(2r + 4)^2 = 8s^2 - 210.

This equation implies that s^2 is odd, which means s is odd. Let s = 2t + 1, where t is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 8(2t + 1)^2 - 210,
(2r + 4)^2 = 8(4t^2 + 4t + 1) - 210,
(2r + 4)^2 = 32t^2 + 32t - 202,
(2r + 4)^2 = 32(t^2 + t - 6).

This equation implies that t^2 + t - 6 is a perfect square. Let&#x27;s denote it as k^2, where k is an integer. We can rewrite the equation as:

t^2 + t - 6 = k^2,
4t^2 + 4t - 24 = 4k^2,
(2t + 1)^2 - 25 = 4k^2,
(2t + 1)^2 - (2k)^2 = 25,
(2t + 2k + 1)(2t - 2k + 1) = 25.

Since 25 is a prime number, we have two cases to consider:

Case 1a: 2t + 2k + 1 = 25 and 2t - 2k + 1 = 1
In this case, we have t = 12 and k = 0. Substituting these values back into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 32(12^2 + 12 - 6),
(2r + 4)^2 = 32(144 + 12 - 6),
(2r + 4)^2 = 32(150),
(2r + 4)^2 = 4800,
2r + 4 = ±√4800,
2r + 4 = ±20√3,
r = -2 ± 10√3.

Case 1b: 2t + 2k + 1 = 1 and 2t - 2k + 1 = 25
In this case, we have t = -12 and k = 0. Substituting these values back into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 32((-12)^2 - 12 - 6),
(2r + 4)^2 = 32(144 - 12 - 6),
(2r + 4)^2 = 32(126),
(2r + 4)^2 = 4032,
2r + 4 = ±√4032,
2r + 4 = ±8√14,
r = -2 ± 4√14.

Therefore, in Case 1, we have four possible values for r: -2 + 10√3, -2 - 10√3, -2 + 4√14, and -2 - 4√14.

Case 2: m^2 ≡ 1 (mod 16)
In this case, m must be odd, so let m = 2s + 1, where s is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(8r + 16)^2 = 16((2s + 1)^2 - 105),
(8r + 16)^2 = 64s^2 + 64s - 1680,
(2r + 4)^2 = 8s^2 + 8s - 210.

This equation implies that s^2 is even, which means s is even. Let s = 2t, where t is an integer. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 8(2t)^2 + 8(2t) - 210,
(2r + 4)^2 = 32t^2 + 32t - 210,
(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16t^2 + 16t - 105).

This equation implies that 16t^2 + 16t - 105 is a perfect square. Let&#x27;s denote it as k^2, where k is an integer. We can rewrite the equation as:

16t^2 + 16t - 105 = k^2,
t^2 + t - 6 = (k/4)^2,
(2t + 1)^2 - 25 = (k/4)^2,
(2t + 1)^2 - (k/2)^2 = 25,
(2t + k/2 + 1)(2t - k/2 + 1) = 25.

Since 25 is a prime number, we have two cases to consider:

Case 2a: 2t + k/2 + 1 = 25 and 2t - k/2 + 1 = 1
In this case, we have t = 12 and k = 0. Substituting these values back into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16(12^2 + 12 - 6)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16(144 + 12 - 6)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16(150)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 4800,
2r + 4 = ±√4800,
2r + 4 = ±20√3,
r = -2 ± 10√3.

Case 2b: 2t + k/2 + 1 = 1 and 2t - k/2 + 1 = 25
In this case, we have t = -12 and k = 0. Substituting these values back into the equation, we get:

(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16((-12)^2 - 12 - 6)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16(144 - 12 - 6)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 2(16(126)),
(2r + 4)^2 = 4032,
2r + 4 = ±√4032,
2r + 4 = ±8√14,
r = -2 ± 4√14.

Therefore, in Case 2, we have four possible values for r: -2 + 10√3, -2 - 10√3, -2 + 4√14, and -2 - 4√14.

In conclusion, the integer solutions to the equation 19x^3 - 84y^2 = 1984 are given by the values of x and y corresponding to the four possible values of r: (-2 + 10√3, x, y), (-2 - 10√3, x, y), (-2 + 4√14, x, y), and (-2 - 4√14, x, y).</code></pre>
