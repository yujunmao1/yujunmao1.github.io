<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of powers formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of powers formula refers to a set of identities used to factor expressions that involve the difference between two terms raised to a power. The most commonly used difference of powers formula is for the difference of two squares, which I&#x27;ve already explained. However, there are also formulas for higher powers, such as the difference of cubes and the general difference of nth powers.

Here are the formulas for the difference of cubes and the general difference of nth powers:

**Difference of Cubes:**
For any two numbers a and b,

a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

This formula allows you to factor the difference of two cubes into the product of a linear term (a - b) and a quadratic term (a² + ab + b²).

**General Difference of nth Powers:**
For any two numbers a and b and a positive integer n,

aⁿ - bⁿ = (a - b)(aⁿ⁻¹ + aⁿ⁻²b + aⁿ⁻³b² + ... + abⁿ⁻² + bⁿ⁻¹)

This formula factors the difference of two nth powers into the product of a linear term (a - b) and a sum of n-1 terms, where each term is a product of powers of a and b with exponents that add up to n-1.

The general formula is particularly useful when n is odd because when n is even, aⁿ - bⁿ can&#x27;t be factored over the real numbers (since even powers represent squares, and the difference of squares doesn&#x27;t have real roots unless a = b).

For example, let&#x27;s factor the difference of fifth powers for a and b:

a⁵ - b⁵ = (a - b)(a⁴ + a³b + a²b² + ab³ + b⁴)

This formula is not typically used for even powers because, as mentioned, the difference of even powers does not factor nicely over the real numbers. However, for odd powers, it provides a systematic way to break down the expression into more manageable parts for further manipulation or simplification.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.
2. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m represents the product of three consecutive integers equal to a perfect mth power. To solve this equation, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the properties of powers.

First, let&#x27;s note that (n-1), n, and (n+1) are three consecutive integers. Among any three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 2, and one must be divisible by 3. This is because the product of any three consecutive integers will include a multiple of 3 (since every third number is divisible by 3) and at least one even number (since every second number is divisible by 2).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of the left side of the equation. Since (n-1), n, and (n+1) are consecutive, they are pairwise coprime; that is, gcd(n-1, n) = gcd(n, n+1) = gcd(n-1, n+1) = 1. This means that the prime factors of (n-1), n, and (n+1) are distinct.

Given that the product (n-1)n(n+1) is equal to a^m, and a^m is a perfect mth power, each of the factors (n-1), n, and (n+1) must also be perfect powers. This is because if gcd(a, b) = gcd(a, c) = 1, then gcd(a, bc) = 1, and if ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a = u^k and b = v^k for gcd(u, v) = 1 and uv = c.

Since (n-1), n, and (n+1) are consecutive, they cannot all be perfect powers of integers greater than 1, except in the trivial case where n-1 = 1, n = 2, and n+1 = 3. In this case, the product is 1*2*3 = 6, which is not a perfect power of an integer greater than 1.

Therefore, the only solution where (n-1)n(n+1) is a perfect power is when n-1 = 1, n = 2, and n+1 = 3. This gives us:

(n-1)n(n+1) = 1*2*3 = 6 = a^m

Since m &gt; 1, there is no integer a &gt; 0 such that 6 = a^m, because 6 is not a perfect power. Thus, there are no non-trivial solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1.</code></pre>
