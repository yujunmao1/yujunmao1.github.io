<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, without considering the order in which they are chosen. This is often referred to as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is denoted by C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to be chosen.

The combination formula is given by:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let&#x27;s break down the formula:

- n! is the factorial of the total number of items, which represents the number of ways to arrange all n items in a sequence.
- k! is the factorial of the number of items chosen, which accounts for the fact that the order of selection within the chosen subset does not matter.
- (n - k)! is the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items chosen, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining items that were not chosen.

By dividing n! by the product of k! and (n - k)!, we effectively count each subset of size k exactly once, regardless of the order in which its elements are listed.

For example, if you have a set of 5 items (n = 5) and you want to know how many ways you can choose 2 items (k = 2) from this set, you would calculate it as follows:

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1) * (3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.

So there are 10 different ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5.

The combination formula is widely used in probability theory, statistics, and various fields where the concept of selecting subsets is relevant. It is also closely related to the binomial theorem, which describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.
3. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations and permutations, considering the restrictions given.

First, let&#x27;s consider the 5 non-apple trees (3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees) as indistinguishable for now, and find the number of ways to arrange them in a row with the condition that no two apple trees are next to each other.

We can start by placing the 5 non-apple trees in a row, which creates 6 potential &quot;slots&quot; where the apple trees can be placed (before the first tree, between each pair of trees, and after the last tree):

_ T _ T _ T _ T _ T _

Where T represents the non-apple trees and the underscores represent the potential slots for the apple trees. We need to place 3 apple trees in these 6 slots such that no two apple trees are adjacent. This is equivalent to choosing 3 slots out of 6 for the apple trees, which can be calculated using the combination formula:

C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = (6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 20

So there are 20 ways to arrange the apple trees among the non-apple trees without any two apple trees being adjacent.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the total number of ways to arrange all 8 trees without any restrictions. Since the trees within each type are indistinguishable, we have 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees. The total number of arrangements is given by the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = (8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2 × 1 * 3 × 2 × 1 * 2 × 1) = (8 × 7 × 5 × 4) / (3 × 2) = 56 × 10 = 560

Finally, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

Probability = Favorable arrangements / Total arrangements = 20 / 560 = 1 / 28

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is 1/28.</code></pre>
