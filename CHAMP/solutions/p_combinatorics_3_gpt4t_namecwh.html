<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the 180-degree rotational invariance on the placement of the rooks.

1. If \( n \) is odd, then the center square of the board must contain a rook because when the board is rotated 180 degrees, the center square maps to itself. Therefore, there is only one choice for the center square.

2. For even \( n = 2k \), if a rook is placed on the first row, then due to the 180-degree rotational invariance, a rook must also be placed on the square that is 180 degrees rotated from the first rook&#x27;s position. This means that if a rook is placed in row 1, column i, then another rook must be placed in row \( 2k \), column \( 2k + 1 - i \).

3. Let \( P(2k) \) be the number of peaceful placements on a \( 2k \times 2k \) board. To express \( P(2k) \) in terms of \( P(2k-2) \), we can consider the placement of a pair of rooks on the outermost rows and columns. Once we place a rook on the first row, its partner on the last row is determined due to rotational invariance. This leaves us with a \( (2k-2) \times (2k-2) \) board where we need to place the remaining \( 2k-2 \) rooks peacefully and with rotational invariance. Therefore, \( P(2k) = (2k-1) \cdot P(2k-2) \), because for the first rook, we have \( 2k-1 \) choices (we can&#x27;t place it in the column where the center rook will go for odd-sized sub-boards).

4. The base case is \( P(2) \). On a \( 2 \times 2 \) board, there is only one way to place two rooks peacefully with 180-degree rotational invariance: one rook in the top left corner and the other in the bottom right corner (or vice versa). So \( P(2) = 1 \).

Now, let&#x27;s find the number of ways to place \( n \) rooks on an \( n \times n \) board with the given constraints.

For odd \( n \), we have \( n = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \). The center square must contain a rook, and we are left with a \( 2k \times 2k \) board where we need to place \( 2k \) rooks. Using the recursive formula, we have:

\( P(2k) = (2k-1) \cdot P(2k-2) \)
\( P(2k-2) = (2k-3) \cdot P(2k-4) \)
\( \vdots \)
\( P(4) = 3 \cdot P(2) \)

Since \( P(2) = 1 \), we can write:

\( P(2k) = (2k-1) \cdot (2k-3) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \)

This is the product of all odd numbers from 1 to \( 2k-1 \), which is the number of ways to place \( 2k \) rooks on a \( 2k \times 2k \) board with rotational invariance. For the \( n = 2k + 1 \) case, we multiply this by 1 for the center square:

\( P(2k + 1) = P(2k) \cdot 1 = (2k-1) \cdot (2k-3) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \)

For even \( n \), we have \( n = 2k \), and the formula directly applies:

\( P(2k) = (2k-1) \cdot (2k-3) \cdot \ldots \cdot 3 \cdot 1 \)

So, the number of ways to place \( n \) rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard with the given constraints is the product of all odd numbers from 1 to \( n-1 \) if \( n \) is even, and the same product if \( n \) is odd (since the center square is fixed and contributes a factor of 1).</code></pre>
