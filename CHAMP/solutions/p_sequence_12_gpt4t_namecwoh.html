<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: cube of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The cube of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that express the cube of a sum or difference of two numbers in terms of the individual numbers and their powers. These formulas are useful for expanding expressions that involve cubed binomials.

The cube of sum formula is given by:

(a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³

This formula states that the cube of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the cube of the second number.

Similarly, the cube of difference formula is given by:

(a - b)³ = a³ - 3a²b + 3ab² - b³

This formula states that the cube of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the difference of the cube of the first number, three times the product of the square of the first number and the second number, three times the product of the first number and the square of the second number, and the negative of the cube of the second number.

Both formulas can be derived from the binomial theorem or by directly multiplying out the binomial (a + b) or (a - b) three times. They are particularly useful in algebra, calculus, and other areas of mathematics where simplifying expressions involving cubes is necessary.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence {a_n} is defined by a_1=1, a_(n+1)=a_n+1/a_n^2. Does a finite limit of a_n exist, and if so, find it.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To investigate whether the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) has a finite limit, we need to look at the behavior of the sequence as \(n\) approaches infinity. The sequence is defined recursively as follows:

\[a_1 = 1\]
\[a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{a_n^2}\]

Let&#x27;s try to find a pattern by computing the first few terms of the sequence:

\[a_1 = 1\]
\[a_2 = a_1 + \frac{1}{a_1^2} = 1 + \frac{1}{1^2} = 1 + 1 = 2\]
\[a_3 = a_2 + \frac{1}{a_2^2} = 2 + \frac{1}{2^2} = 2 + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{9}{4}\]
\[a_4 = a_3 + \frac{1}{a_3^2} = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{1}{(\frac{9}{4})^2} = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{1}{\frac{81}{16}} = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{16}{81}\]

As we can see, each term is positive and larger than the previous term, which suggests that the sequence is increasing. Moreover, because we are adding the reciprocal of the square of the previous term, the amount by which each term increases is getting smaller as \(n\) increases.

To determine if the sequence has a finite limit, we need to show that it is bounded above. If it is both increasing and bounded above, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it will have a finite limit.

However, in this case, it&#x27;s not immediately clear if there is an upper bound for the sequence. The recursive formula shows that each term is greater than the previous term, and the amount added to each subsequent term is decreasing, but it&#x27;s not decreasing fast enough to suggest that the sequence will converge to a finite limit.

To prove this more rigorously, we can use the fact that \(a_n\) is increasing and positive to show that the sequence diverges to infinity. Since \(a_n &gt; 0\) for all \(n\), we have:

\[a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{a_n^2} &gt; a_n\]

This means that \(a_n\) is strictly increasing. Now, let&#x27;s assume for the sake of contradiction that the sequence \(\{a_n\}\) converges to a finite limit \(L\). Then, we would have:

\[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = L\]
\[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n+1} = L\]

But from the recursive formula, we also have:

\[\lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(a_n + \frac{1}{a_n^2}\right)\]

If \(L\) were finite, then as \(n\) approaches infinity, the term \(\frac{1}{a_n^2}\) would approach zero, and we would have:

\[L = L + 0\]

This is a contradiction because it implies that \(0 = \frac{1}{L^2}\), which is impossible for a finite, non-zero \(L\). Therefore, the sequence does not converge to a finite limit; instead, it diverges to infinity. There is no finite limit for the sequence \(\{a_n\}\).</code></pre>
