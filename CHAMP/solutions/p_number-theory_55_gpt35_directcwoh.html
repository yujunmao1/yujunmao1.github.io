Let (x, y, z) be an integer solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 4?

You may find the following information useful:

1. (x±y)^2=x^2±2xy+y^2.
2. (a+b) mod m=((a mod m)+(b mod m) mod m). (a-b) mod m=((a mod m)-(b mod m) mod m). ab mod m=((a mod m)*(b mod m) mod m). a^k mod m=((a mod m)^k mod m).
3. For odd x, x^2 mod 8=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can consider the possible remainders when dividing a number by 4. 

If a number is divisible by 4, its remainder when divided by 4 is 0. If a number is not divisible by 4, it can have a remainder of 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4.

Let&#x27;s consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2. We want to find the minimum number of variables (x, y, or z) that must be divisible by 4.

First, let&#x27;s consider the possible remainders when squaring a number and dividing it by 4:

For x:
- If x is divisible by 4, then x^2 is divisible by 4.
- If x has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, then x^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
- If x has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then x^2 has a remainder of 0 when divided by 4.
- If x has a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, then x^2 has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

Similarly, for y and z, we can consider the possible remainders when squared and divided by 4.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2:

- If both x and y are divisible by 4, then x^2 and y^2 are divisible by 4. Therefore, z^2 must also be divisible by 4, and z must be divisible by 4.
- If one of x or y is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, then x^2 or y^2 is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and z must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
- If one of x or y is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then x^2 or y^2 is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 0 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 0 when divided by 4, and z must be divisible by 4.
- If one of x or y is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, then x^2 or y^2 is divisible by 4, and the other has a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and z must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
- If both x and y have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, then x^2 and y^2 have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and z must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
- If both x and y have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, then x^2 and y^2 have a remainder of 0 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 0 when divided by 4, and z must be divisible by 4.
- If both x and y have a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, then x^2 and y^2 have a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. Therefore, z^2 must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, and z must have a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.

From the above analysis, we can see that in all cases, at least one of the variables (x, y, or z) must be divisible by 4.

Therefore, the minimum number of variables that must be divisible by 4 is 1.</code></pre>
