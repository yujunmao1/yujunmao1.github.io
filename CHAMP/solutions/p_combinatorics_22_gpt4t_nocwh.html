<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider the subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} and define a mapping f from these subsets to the subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element (e.g., f({0, 2, 3, 5})={2, 3, 5}).
2. For f(x)=y, where x and y are the two subsets, how many x map to the same y?
3. Relate the number of all possible x to the sum of the smallest element of all possible y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all possible subsets of r elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n}. Let&#x27;s denote this mean by M.

First, let&#x27;s consider the subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} and the mapping f as described. For each subset y of {1, ..., n} with r elements, there is exactly one subset x of {0, 1, ..., n} with r+1 elements that maps to y under f, which is obtained by adding the smallest element of y back into y.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the number of subsets of {1, ..., n} with r elements that have a fixed smallest element k. The remaining r-1 elements must be chosen from the set {k+1, k+2, ..., n}, which has n-k elements. The number of ways to choose these r-1 elements is given by the binomial coefficient C(n-k, r-1).

The sum of the smallest elements of all possible subsets is then the sum over all possible values of k (from 1 to n-r+1, since k cannot be larger than n-r+1 or there wouldn&#x27;t be enough elements left to form a subset of r elements) of k times the number of subsets with k as the smallest element:

Sum = Σ (k * C(n-k, r-1)) for k = 1 to n-r+1

To find the arithmetic mean M, we divide this sum by the total number of subsets of r elements from {1, ..., n}, which is C(n, r):

M = Sum / C(n, r)

Now, let&#x27;s compute the sum:

Sum = Σ (k * C(n-k, r-1)) for k = 1 to n-r+1

We can rewrite the binomial coefficient C(n-k, r-1) as:

C(n-k, r-1) = (n-k)! / [(r-1)! * (n-k-(r-1))!]
             = (n-k)! / [(r-1)! * (n-r-k+1)!]

Now, let&#x27;s rewrite the sum using this expression:

Sum = Σ (k * (n-k)! / [(r-1)! * (n-r-k+1)!]) for k = 1 to n-r+1

This sum is not straightforward to compute directly. However, we can use a combinatorial argument to simplify the problem. We can think of the sum as the number of ways to choose an r-element subset from {1, ..., n} and then select the smallest element from that subset. This is equivalent to first choosing the smallest element k and then choosing the remaining r-1 elements from the remaining n-k elements.

To find the mean, we need to count the total number of times each element from 1 to n-r+1 appears as the smallest element in a subset of size r. Each element k can be the smallest element in C(n-k, r-1) subsets, as we&#x27;ve seen before.

Let&#x27;s denote S(k) as the number of times k appears as the smallest element in a subset of size r. Then:

S(k) = C(n-k, r-1)

The total number of times any number appears as the smallest element is then:

Total = Σ S(k) for k = 1 to n-r+1
       = Σ C(n-k, r-1) for k = 1 to n-r+1

Now, we need to find the sum of all k * S(k):

Sum = Σ k * S(k) for k = 1 to n-r+1
     = Σ k * C(n-k, r-1) for k = 1 to n-r+1

To find the mean M, we divide this sum by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r):

M = Sum / C(n, r)

Now, we need to find a closed-form expression for Sum. This is a non-trivial combinatorial sum, and there isn&#x27;t a simple formula for it. However, we can use a recursive argument or generating functions to find a pattern or relationship that simplifies the sum.

One approach is to consider the relationship between C(n-k, r-1) and C(n-k-1, r-1) and use this to build a recursive formula for the sum. We know that:

C(n-k, r-1) = C(n-k-1, r-1) + C(n-k-1, r-2)

Using this, we can express S(k) in terms of S(k+1) and find a recursive formula for the sum. However, this approach is quite involved and may not lead to a simple expression for M.

Another approach is to use generating functions to find a closed-form expression for the sum. We can construct a generating function for the sequence S(k) and then use it to find the sum of k * S(k). This approach also requires a good deal of combinatorial and algebraic manipulation.

Given the complexity of finding a closed-form expression for Sum, we may need to resort to computational methods or further combinatorial insights to simplify the problem. Unfortunately, without additional combinatorial identities or techniques, we cannot provide a simple closed-form expression for M using the information given.

If there are specific combinatorial identities or techniques that you would like to apply to this problem, please provide them, and we can work through the problem using those tools.</code></pre>
