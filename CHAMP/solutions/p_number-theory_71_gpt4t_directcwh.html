What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.
4. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
5. x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y).
6. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
7. (a+b) mod m=((a mod m)+(b mod m) mod m). (a-b) mod m=((a mod m)-(b mod m) mod m). ab mod m=((a mod m)*(b mod m) mod m). a^k mod m=((a mod m)^k mod m).
8. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
9. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
10. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
11. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s start by examining the expression |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n.

1. Can the expression be 0?
For the expression to be 0, we would need 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are co-prime (they share no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions to this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. Can the expression equal 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6?
Since 5 and 12 are co-prime, their powers will also be co-prime. This means that |12^m - 5^n| cannot be 1, because if it were, 12^m and 5^n would differ by 1, implying they share a common factor, which is not possible.

Let&#x27;s consider the possibilities for |12^m - 5^n| being 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can quickly check small values of m and n to see if any of these differences occur. However, since 12^m grows much faster than 5^n, we can expect that for large m and n, the difference will be much larger than 6. Therefore, we only need to check small values of m and n.

Checking manually, we find that no small values of m and n give a difference of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For example, 12^1 - 5^1 = 7, which is already larger than 6.

3. Since 5 and 12 are co-prime, and 12 is not 1, it follows that 12 does not divide any power of 5. Therefore, 12^m - 5^n cannot be 1.

4. If we express 5^n in terms of m, we get 5^n = 12^m - 1. The factors of 5^n are all powers of 5, and since 12^m - 1 is one less than a power of 12, it cannot be a power of 5.

5. We can use the identity x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) to factor expressions of the form 5^(2n) - 1, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

6. Considering the equation modulo 3, we note that 12 ≡ 0 (mod 3) and 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3). Therefore, 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3) for any m, and 5^n ≡ 2^n (mod 3). If n is even, then 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 3), and if n is odd, then 2^n ≡ 2 (mod 3). This means that 5^n - 12^m cannot be 1, because if n is even, 5^n ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3), so 5^n - 12^m ≡ 1 (mod 3). If n is odd, 5^n ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3), so 5^n - 12^m ≡ 2 (mod 3).

7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify calculations, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

8. For even n, we can factor 5^n - 1 into (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). We can check the divisibility of these factors by 4, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

9. Recognizing that 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we can try to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1, but this is a complex problem that requires more detailed analysis.

10. We can check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

11. Studying possible solutions of the factor splitting is a complex problem that requires more detailed analysis.

Given the complexity of the problem and the fact that we have not found a simple solution for small values of m and n, we may need to resort to a more systematic search or advanced number-theoretic techniques to find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|. This problem appears to be non-trivial and may not have a simple closed-form solution.</code></pre>
