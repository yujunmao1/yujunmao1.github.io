<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. At most how many of the three sequences can be bounded?

You may find the following information useful:

1. For positive x, x+1/x≥2, with equality if and only if x=1.
2. (x±y)^2=x^2±2xy+y^2.
3. For real numbers a_1, ..., a_n and b_1, ..., b_n, (a_1*b_1+...+a_n*b_n)^2≤(a_1^2+...+a_n^2)(b_1^2+...+b_n^2).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given information to analyze the behavior of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n}.

First, let&#x27;s use the inequality given in point 1:

For positive x, x + 1/x ≥ 2, with equality if and only if x = 1.

This inequality will be useful because each term in the sequences is defined as the sum of a term from another sequence and the reciprocal of a term from a third sequence.

Let&#x27;s apply this inequality to the terms of the sequences:

x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n ≥ 2, with equality if and only if y_n = 1/z_n.
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n ≥ 2, with equality if and only if z_n = 1/x_n.
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n ≥ 2, with equality if and only if x_n = 1/y_n.

Since x_1, y_1, and z_1 are positive, all subsequent terms in the sequences will also be positive. Therefore, the inequality holds for all terms in the sequences.

Now, let&#x27;s assume that one of the sequences is bounded. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume that {x_n} is bounded. This means there exists some M such that x_n ≤ M for all n.

Since x_n is bounded, and x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n, it follows that y_n and 1/z_n must also be bounded because the sum of two unbounded sequences cannot be bounded. Therefore, y_n ≤ M&#x27; and 1/z_n ≤ M&#x27;&#x27; for some M&#x27; and M&#x27;&#x27;.

Similarly, if y_n is bounded, then z_n and 1/x_n must be bounded, and if z_n is bounded, then x_n and 1/y_n must be bounded.

However, if all three sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} are bounded, then the reciprocals 1/x_n, 1/y_n, and 1/z_n are also bounded away from zero (since the sequences consist of positive terms). This would imply that all three sequences are also bounded away from zero.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of the squares of the three sequences:

S_n = x_n^2 + y_n^2 + z_n^2.

We want to see how S_n evolves as n increases. Using the definitions of the sequences, we can write:

S_(n+1) = x_(n+1)^2 + y_(n+1)^2 + z_(n+1)^2
         = (y_n + 1/z_n)^2 + (z_n + 1/x_n)^2 + (x_n + 1/y_n)^2.

Expanding the squares using point 2:

S_(n+1) = y_n^2 + 2*y_n*(1/z_n) + (1/z_n)^2 + z_n^2 + 2*z_n*(1/x_n) + (1/x_n)^2 + x_n^2 + 2*x_n*(1/y_n) + (1/y_n)^2.

Now, let&#x27;s group the terms:

S_(n+1) = (x_n^2 + y_n^2 + z_n^2) + 2*(x_n*(1/y_n) + y_n*(1/z_n) + z_n*(1/x_n)) + ((1/x_n)^2 + (1/y_n)^2 + (1/z_n)^2).

Notice that the first group of terms is just S_n. The second group of terms is at least 6, because each term in the parentheses is at least 2 by the inequality we used earlier. The third group of terms is the sum of the squares of the reciprocals, which is also positive.

Therefore, we have:

S_(n+1) ≥ S_n + 6.

This means that S_n is strictly increasing by at least 6 each step. Since S_1 is positive, S_n will become arbitrarily large as n increases. This implies that at least one of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, or {z_n} must be unbounded, because if all were bounded, S_n would also be bounded, which contradicts the fact that it increases without bound.

Therefore, at most two of the sequences can be bounded. If two sequences were bounded, the third would be forced to be unbounded due to the increasing nature of S_n. However, we have shown that if one sequence is bounded, the other two must also be bounded, which leads to a contradiction. Thus, at most one of the sequences can be bounded.</code></pre>
