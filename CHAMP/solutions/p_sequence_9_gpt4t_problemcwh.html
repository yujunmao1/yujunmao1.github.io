<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider a sequence (x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_(n-1))=(1, 1, 1, ..., 1) representing the initial state of the lamp, and each S_j appends the new state of the lamp being affected to the sequence.
2. Find a formula for x_(j+1) given x_0, ..., x_j.
3. Let v_j=[x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)] be a binary vector.
4. Study any possible repetitions in the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ...
5. Study if the mapping from v_j to v_(j+1) is invertible, and its implication on the repetition of sequence values.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to understand the effect of each step S_j on the state of the lamps and how the sequence of vectors v_j evolves over time. Let&#x27;s start by defining the initial state and the effect of each step.

Initial state:
All lamps are ON, so the initial sequence is (x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_(n-1)) = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1).

Effect of step S_j:
- If L_(j-1) is ON (x_(j-1) = 1), then L_j changes state (x_j toggles).
- If L_(j-1) is OFF (x_(j-1) = 0), then L_j remains in its current state (x_j remains the same).

Now, let&#x27;s find a formula for x_(j+1) given x_0, ..., x_j. We can see that:

x_(j+1) = x_j XOR x_(j-1)

This is because if L_(j-1) is ON (x_(j-1) = 1), then x_j toggles (x_j XOR 1), and if L_(j-1) is OFF (x_(j-1) = 0), then x_j remains the same (x_j XOR 0).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the binary vector v_j = [x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)]. The mapping from v_j to v_(j+1) is given by the effect of step S_(j+1). We need to determine if this mapping is invertible.

If the mapping is invertible, then each vector v_j uniquely determines the next vector v_(j+1), and since there are a finite number of possible vectors (2^n), the sequence of vectors must eventually repeat. This implies that the system will return to its initial state (all lamps ON) at some point.

If the mapping is not invertible, then there may be some vectors v_j that can lead to the same vector v_(j+1), meaning that information is lost, and we cannot uniquely determine a previous state from a given state. In this case, it&#x27;s possible that the system may not return to its initial state.

To determine if the mapping is invertible, we need to check if the transformation from v_j to v_(j+1) is bijective. This transformation is a linear transformation in the vector space over the field with two elements (binary vectors). The transformation can be represented by an n x n matrix where each row represents the effect of the corresponding step S_j on the lamp states.

The matrix will look like this:

```
1 1 0 0 ... 0 0
0 1 1 0 ... 0 0
0 0 1 1 ... 0 0
...
0 0 0 0 ... 1 1
1 0 0 0 ... 0 1
```

This is a circulant matrix, and its invertibility depends on whether its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of a circulant matrix can be computed using the eigenvalues, which are given by the discrete Fourier transform of the first row of the matrix.

For the given matrix, the first row is (1, 1, 0, ..., 0), and the eigenvalues are given by:

λ_k = 1 + e^(2πik/n), for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1

We need to check if any of these eigenvalues are zero. If none of them are zero, the matrix is invertible, and the system will return to its initial state. If any eigenvalue is zero, the matrix is not invertible, and the system may not return to its initial state.

For λ_k to be zero, we need:

1 + cos(2πk/n) + i*sin(2πk/n) = 0

This can only happen if cos(2πk/n) = -1 and sin(2πk/n) = 0, which occurs when 2πk/n = π, or k/n = 1/2. This means that n must be even for the eigenvalue to be zero.

Therefore, for even n, the system may not return to its initial state, and for odd n, the system will always return to its initial state.

Since we are considering n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, we need to count the even numbers in this set to find out how many of them result in the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again.

There are 50 even numbers between 2 and 100 (inclusive), so for 50 values of n, the sequence of switching may not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again.</code></pre>
