Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

Suppose you want to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear. There are 5 different shirts to choose from, 3 different pants to choose from, and 2 different shoes to choose from. No two items can be worn at the same time, so you can&#x27;t wear a shirt and pants at the same time, or a shirt and shoes at the same time. So, there are $5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to choose a car, a house, and a pet. There are 10 different cars to choose from, 5 different houses to choose from, and 3 different pets to choose from. No two items can be owned at the same time, so you can&#x27;t own a car and a house at the same time, or a car and a pet at the same time. So, there are $10 \times 5 \times 3 = 150$ ways to choose a car, a house, and a pet.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is one way to solve the problem:

We can think of each string as a sequence of 5 slots, where each slot can be filled with a 1, 2, or 3. We want to count the number of strings where no two 1s are neighbors.

One way to do this is to first count the number of strings where the 1s are always separated by at least one other digit. We can do this by considering the following cases:

* The 1s are at the ends of the string. There are 3 ways to choose the first digit, 3 ways to choose the second digit, and 2 ways to choose the third digit. So, there are $3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18$ strings of this type.
* The 1s are in the middle of the string, with one other digit on either side. There are 3 ways to choose the first digit, 2 ways to choose the second digit, 3 ways to choose the third digit, and 2 ways to choose the fourth digit. So, there are $3 \times 2 \times 3 \times 2 = 36$ strings of this type.
* The 1s are next to each other, with two other digits on either side. There is only one way to choose the first digit, one way to choose the second digit, one way to choose the third digit, and one way to choose the fourth digit. So, there is only 1 string of this type.

So, there are $18 + 36 + 1 = 55$ strings where the 1s are always separated by at least one other digit.

Now, we need to count the number of strings where the 1s are not always separated by at least one other digit. This is easy to do, since there is only one way to choose the first digit, one way to choose the second digit, and one way to choose the third digit. So, there are $3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27$ strings of this type.

Finally, we need to subtract the number of strings where the 1s are not always separated by at least one other digit from the number of strings where no two 1s are neighbors. This gives us the following answer:

$3! - 27 = 18$

Therefore, there are 18 strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.</code></pre>
