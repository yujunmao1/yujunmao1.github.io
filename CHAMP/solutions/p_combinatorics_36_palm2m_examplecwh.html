Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

I hope this helps!</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.

Suppose you have a box of 12 eggs. You count the eggs once and get a total of 12 counts. This means that you have counted each egg once. If you count the eggs again, you will get a total of 24 counts. This means that you have counted each egg twice. If you count the eggs a third time, you will get a total of 36 counts. This means that you have counted each egg three times. And so on.

In general, if you count each object d times, you will get a total of n counts, where n is the number of objects. So, if you have n objects and you count each object d times, you will get a total of n*d counts.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. A rotation of the table preserves the neighboring relationship.
2. A reflection (mirroring) of the table through the center preserves the neighboring relationship.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are $n!$ ways to arrange $n$ people around a circular table. However, many of these arrangements are equivalent under rotations and reflections of the table. To count the number of distinct arrangements, we need to divide by the number of ways to rotate the table and the number of ways to reflect the table.

The number of ways to rotate a table is $n$, since each person can be in any of $n$ positions around the table. The number of ways to reflect the table is $2$, since the table can be reflected either horizontally or vertically. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of $n$ people around a circular table is

$$\frac{n!}{n\times 2} = \frac{n!}{2n}.$$

Here is a more detailed explanation of the solution.

Suppose we have $n$ people, and we want to arrange them around a circular table. We can think of this as a process of choosing a position for each person, one at a time. The first person can sit in any of $n$ positions. The second person can only sit in one of the $n-1$ remaining positions, since the first person cannot be in the same position as the second person. The third person can only sit in one of the $n-2$ remaining positions, and so on. Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the people is $n!$.

However, many of these arrangements are equivalent under rotations and reflections of the table. For example, if we rotate the table by 90 degrees, the arrangement of the people will be the same. Similarly, if we reflect the table through the center, the arrangement of the people will be the same. Therefore, we need to divide the number of possible arrangements by the number of ways to rotate the table and the number of ways to reflect the table.

The number of ways to rotate a table is $n$, since each person can be in any of $n$ positions around the table. The number of ways to reflect the table is $2$, since the table can be reflected either horizontally or vertically. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of $n$ people around a circular table is

$$\frac{n!}{n\times 2} = \frac{n!}{2n}.$$</code></pre>
