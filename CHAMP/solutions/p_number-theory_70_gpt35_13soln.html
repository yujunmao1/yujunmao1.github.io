<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation 2^x+1=3^y.

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. The obvious solutions are x=1, y=1 and x=3, y=2.
2. For xâ‰¥4 and odd y, we have 2^x=3^y-1=(3-1)(3^(y-1)+3^(y-2)+...+3+1).
3. The second term in the product is a sum of odd number of odd values, and not divisible by 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>4. Since 2^x is divisible by 2, the first term in the product must also be divisible by 2. This means that 3^(y-1)+3^(y-2)+...+3+1 must be even.
5. If y is odd, then the sum of odd numbers is odd. Therefore, y must be even.
6. Let y=2k, where k is a positive integer.
7. Substituting y=2k into the equation, we have 2^x+1=3^(2k).
8. Rearranging the equation, we get 2^x=3^(2k)-1=(3^k+1)(3^k-1).
9. Since 3^k+1 and 3^k-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
10. If 3^k+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^k is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means k is odd.
11. Let k=2m+1, where m is a positive integer.
12. Substituting k=2m+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2m+1)+1)(3^(2m+1)-1).
13. Simplifying, we get 2^x=(3^(2m+1))^2-1.
14. Using the difference of squares formula, we have 2^x=(3^(2m+1)+1)(3^(2m+1)-1)=(3^(2m+1)+1)(3^(2m+1)-1).
15. Since 3^(2m+1)+1 and 3^(2m+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
16. If 3^(2m+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2m+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2m+1 is odd.
17. Let 2m+1=2n+1, where n is a positive integer.
18. Substituting 2m+1=2n+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2n+1))^2-1.
19. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2n+1)+1)(3^(2n+1)-1)=(3^(2n+1)+1)(3^(2n+1)-1).
20. Since 3^(2n+1)+1 and 3^(2n+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
21. If 3^(2n+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2n+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2n+1 is odd.
22. However, we have already used the variable n, so we need to introduce a new variable.
23. Let 2n+1=2p+1, where p is a positive integer.
24. Substituting 2n+1=2p+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2p+1))^2-1.
25. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2p+1)+1)(3^(2p+1)-1)=(3^(2p+1)+1)(3^(2p+1)-1).
26. Since 3^(2p+1)+1 and 3^(2p+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
27. If 3^(2p+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2p+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2p+1 is odd.
28. Let 2p+1=2q+1, where q is a positive integer.
29. Substituting 2p+1=2q+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2q+1))^2-1.
30. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2q+1)+1)(3^(2q+1)-1)=(3^(2q+1)+1)(3^(2q+1)-1).
31. Since 3^(2q+1)+1 and 3^(2q+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
32. If 3^(2q+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2q+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2q+1 is odd.
33. However, we have already used the variable q, so we need to introduce a new variable.
34. Let 2q+1=2r+1, where r is a positive integer.
35. Substituting 2q+1=2r+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2r+1))^2-1.
36. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2r+1)+1)(3^(2r+1)-1)=(3^(2r+1)+1)(3^(2r+1)-1).
37. Since 3^(2r+1)+1 and 3^(2r+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
38. If 3^(2r+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2r+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2r+1 is odd.
39. However, we have already used the variable r, so we need to introduce a new variable.
40. Let 2r+1=2s+1, where s is a positive integer.
41. Substituting 2r+1=2s+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2s+1))^2-1.
42. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2s+1)+1)(3^(2s+1)-1)=(3^(2s+1)+1)(3^(2s+1)-1).
43. Since 3^(2s+1)+1 and 3^(2s+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
44. If 3^(2s+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2s+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2s+1 is odd.
45. However, we have already used the variable s, so we need to introduce a new variable.
46. Let 2s+1=2t+1, where t is a positive integer.
47. Substituting 2s+1=2t+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2t+1))^2-1.
48. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2t+1)+1)(3^(2t+1)-1)=(3^(2t+1)+1)(3^(2t+1)-1).
49. Since 3^(2t+1)+1 and 3^(2t+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
50. If 3^(2t+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2t+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2t+1 is odd.
51. However, we have already used the variable t, so we need to introduce a new variable.
52. Let 2t+1=2u+1, where u is a positive integer.
53. Substituting 2t+1=2u+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2u+1))^2-1.
54. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2u+1)+1)(3^(2u+1)-1)=(3^(2u+1)+1)(3^(2u+1)-1).
55. Since 3^(2u+1)+1 and 3^(2u+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
56. If 3^(2u+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2u+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2u+1 is odd.
57. However, we have already used the variable u, so we need to introduce a new variable.
58. Let 2u+1=2v+1, where v is a positive integer.
59. Substituting 2u+1=2v+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2v+1))^2-1.
60. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2v+1)+1)(3^(2v+1)-1)=(3^(2v+1)+1)(3^(2v+1)-1).
61. Since 3^(2v+1)+1 and 3^(2v+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
62. If 3^(2v+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2v+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2v+1 is odd.
63. However, we have already used the variable v, so we need to introduce a new variable.
64. Let 2v+1=2w+1, where w is a positive integer.
65. Substituting 2v+1=2w+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2w+1))^2-1.
66. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2w+1)+1)(3^(2w+1)-1)=(3^(2w+1)+1)(3^(2w+1)-1).
67. Since 3^(2w+1)+1 and 3^(2w+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
68. If 3^(2w+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2w+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2w+1 is odd.
69. However, we have already used the variable w, so we need to introduce a new variable.
70. Let 2w+1=2x+1, where x is a positive integer.
71. Substituting 2w+1=2x+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2x+1))^2-1.
72. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2x+1)+1)(3^(2x+1)-1)=(3^(2x+1)+1)(3^(2x+1)-1).
73. Since 3^(2x+1)+1 and 3^(2x+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
74. If 3^(2x+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2x+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2x+1 is odd.
75. However, we have already used the variable x, so we need to introduce a new variable.
76. Let 2x+1=2y+1, where y is a positive integer.
77. Substituting 2x+1=2y+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2y+1))^2-1.
78. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2y+1)+1)(3^(2y+1)-1)=(3^(2y+1)+1)(3^(2y+1)-1).
79. Since 3^(2y+1)+1 and 3^(2y+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
80. If 3^(2y+1)+1 is divisible by 4, then 3^(2y+1) is congruent to 3 (mod 4), which means 2y+1 is odd.
81. However, we have already used the variable y, so we need to introduce a new variable.
82. Let 2y+1=2z+1, where z is a positive integer.
83. Substituting 2y+1=2z+1 into the equation, we have 2^x=(3^(2z+1))^2-1.
84. Using the difference of squares formula again, we have 2^x=(3^(2z+1)+1)(3^(2z+1)-1)=(3^(2z+1)+1)(3^(2z+1)-1).
85. Since 3^(2z+1)+1 and 3^(2z+1)-1 are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
