<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Vieta&#x27;s formula for cubic equation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Vieta&#x27;s formulas are a set of equations that relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. These formulas are named after the French mathematician François Viète (also known as Vieta), who introduced a new way of solving equations in the 16th century.

For a cubic equation of the form:

ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0

where a, b, c, and d are real or complex coefficients and a ≠ 0, Vieta&#x27;s formulas for the cubic equation tell us that if the roots of the equation are r1, r2, and r3, then:

1. The sum of the roots is equal to the opposite of the coefficient of the x^2 term divided by the coefficient of the x^3 term:

r1 + r2 + r3 = -b/a

2. The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is equal to the coefficient of the x term divided by the coefficient of the x^3 term:

r1r2 + r1r3 + r2r3 = c/a

3. The product of the roots is equal to the opposite of the constant term divided by the coefficient of the x^3 term:

r1r2r3 = -d/a

These relationships are very useful when solving cubic equations, as they can sometimes allow you to find the roots of the equation without having to perform more complicated methods such as factoring or using the cubic formula. Vieta&#x27;s formulas also apply to polynomials of other degrees, with the general pattern being that the k-th symmetric sum of the roots is related to the coefficient of the term with degree n-k, where n is the degree of the polynomial.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The polynomial ax^3+bx^2+cx+d has integer coefficients a, b, c, d with ad odd and bc even. Can some values of a, b, c, d result in all three roots of the polynomial being integers?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(x)=ax^3+bx^2+cx+d with its three roots being x_1, x_2, x_3.
2. Let y_i=a*x_i for i=1, 2, 3 and find a polynomial which has y_i as the roots by studying the polynomial a^2*f(x).
3. Study the parity of y_i from the constant term a^2*d.
4. Study the parity of b and ac from that of y_i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s follow the steps outlined to investigate whether the polynomial \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with integer coefficients \( a, b, c, d \), where \( ad \) is odd and \( bc \) is even, can have all three roots being integers.

First, we consider the polynomial \( a^2f(x) \), which will have the same roots as \( f(x) \), but scaled by a factor of \( a \). The polynomial \( a^2f(x) \) is given by:

\[ a^2f(x) = a^3x^3 + a^2bx^2 + acx + a^2d \]

Let \( y_i = ax_i \) for \( i = 1, 2, 3 \), where \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \). Then \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \) are the roots of \( a^2f(x) \), and by Vieta&#x27;s formulas for the new polynomial \( a^2f(x) \), we have:

1. \( y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = -a^2b \)
2. \( y_1y_2 + y_1y_3 + y_2y_3 = a^2c \)
3. \( y_1y_2y_3 = a^2d \)

Since \( a^2d \) is the product of the roots \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \), and we know that \( ad \) is odd, \( a^2d \) must also be odd because the square of an odd number is odd. This implies that all three roots \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \) must be odd because the product of an even number with any other number is even, and the only way to get an odd product is for all factors to be odd.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sum of the roots \( y_1 + y_2 + y_3 \). Since this sum is equal to \( -a^2b \) and \( y_1, y_2, y_3 \) are all odd, their sum must be odd. However, \( a^2b \) must be even because \( bc \) is even, and \( a^2 \) is always even or odd depending on \( a \). If \( a \) is odd, \( a^2 \) is odd, and since \( b \) is even (as \( bc \) is even), \( a^2b \) is even. This leads to a contradiction because the sum of three odd numbers cannot be even.

Therefore, it is not possible for the polynomial \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) with the given conditions to have all three roots being integers. The parity argument shows that the roots cannot all be integers because it would lead to a contradiction in the parity of the sum and product of the roots.</code></pre>
