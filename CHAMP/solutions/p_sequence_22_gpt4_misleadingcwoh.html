A sequence {x_n} is defined by x_1=2, x_(n+1)=(x_n^4+9)/(10x_n). For how many values of x_1, x_2, ..., x_1000 do we have x_n≤5/4?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Let (a_1, ..., a_n) and (b_1, ..., b_n) be two similarly sorted sequences (e.g., both increasing or both decreasing). Then ((a_1+...+a_n)/n)*((b_1+...+b_n)/n)≤(a_1*b_1+...+a_n*b_n)/n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The problem is asking for the number of terms in the sequence {x_n} that are less than or equal to 5/4, given the recursive formula for the sequence and the initial term x_1=2.

First, let&#x27;s examine the recursive formula: x_(n+1)=(x_n^4+9)/(10x_n). This formula generates the next term in the sequence based on the current term. 

We can see that if x_n is less than or equal to 5/4, then x_(n+1) will also be less than or equal to 5/4. This is because the numerator of the fraction (x_n^4+9) will be less than or equal to (5/4)^4+9, and the denominator (10x_n) will be greater than or equal to 10*(5/4). Therefore, the fraction as a whole will be less than or equal to 5/4.

However, the initial term x_1=2 is greater than 5/4. Therefore, we need to find the first term x_n that is less than or equal to 5/4, and then all subsequent terms will also be less than or equal to 5/4.

To do this, we can use the recursive formula to generate the terms of the sequence until we find a term that is less than or equal to 5/4. 

Starting with x_1=2, we find:

x_2 = (2^4+9)/(10*2) = 2.05, which is greater than 5/4.

x_3 = (2.05^4+9)/(10*2.05) = 1.96, which is greater than 5/4.

x_4 = (1.96^4+9)/(10*1.96) = 1.88, which is greater than 5/4.

x_5 = (1.88^4+9)/(10*1.88) = 1.81, which is greater than 5/4.

x_6 = (1.81^4+9)/(10*1.81) = 1.75, which is greater than 5/4.

x_7 = (1.75^4+9)/(10*1.75) = 1.70, which is greater than 5/4.

x_8 = (1.70^4+9)/(10*1.70) = 1.66, which is greater than 5/4.

x_9 = (1.66^4+9)/(10*1.66) = 1.62, which is greater than 5/4.

x_10 = (1.62^4+9)/(10*1.62) = 1.59, which is greater than 5/4.

x_11 = (1.59^4+9)/(10*1.59) = 1.56, which is greater than 5/4.

x_12 = (1.56^4+9)/(10*1.56) = 1.54, which is greater than 5/4.

x_13 = (1.54^4+9)/(10*1.54) = 1.52, which is greater than 5/4.

x_14 = (1.52^4+9)/(10*1.52) = 1.50, which is greater than 5/4.

x_15 = (1.50^4+9)/(10*1.50) = 1.49, which is greater than 5/4.

x_16 = (1.49^4+9)/(10*1.49) = 1.48, which is greater than 5/4.

x_17 = (1.48^4+9)/(10*1.48) = 1.47, which is greater than 5/4.

x_18 = (1.47^4+9)/(10*1.47) = 1.46, which is greater than 5/4.

x_19 = (1.46^4+9)/(10*1.46) = 1.45, which is greater than 5/4.

x_20 = (1.45^4+9)/(10*1.45) = 1.44, which is greater than 5/4.

x_21 = (1.44^4+9)/(10*1.44) = 1.43, which is greater than 5/4.

x_22 = (1.43^4+9)/(10*1.43) = 1.42, which is greater than 5/4.

x_23 = (1.42^4+9)/(10*1.42) = 1.41, which is greater than 5/4.

x_24 = (1.41^4+9)/(10*1.41) = 1.40, which is greater than 5/4.

x_25 = (1.40^4+9)/(10*1.40) = 1.39, which is greater than 5/4.

x_26 = (1.39^4+9)/(10*1.39) = 1.38, which is greater than 5/4.

x_27 = (1.38^4+9)/(10*1.38) = 1.37, which is greater than 5/4.

x_28 = (1.37^4+9)/(10*1.37) = 1.36, which is greater than 5/4.

x_29 = (1.36^4+9)/(10*1.36) = 1.35, which is greater than 5/4.

x_30 = (1.35^4+9)/(10*1.35) = 1.34, which is greater than 5/4.

x_31 = (1.34^4+9)/(10*1.34) = 1.33, which is greater than 5/4.

x_32 = (1.33^4+9)/(10*1.33) = 1.32, which is greater than 5/4.

x_33 = (1.32^4+9)/(10*1.32) = 1.31, which is greater than 5/4.

x_34 = (1.31^4+9)/(10*1.31) = 1.30, which is greater than 5/4.

x_35 = (1.30^4+9)/(10*1.30) = 1.29, which is greater than 5/4.

x_36 = (1.29^4+9)/(10*1.29) = 1.28, which is greater than 5/4.

x_37 = (1.28^4+9)/(10*1.28) = 1.27, which is greater than 5/4.

x_38 = (1.27^4+9)/(10*1.27) = 1.26, which is greater than 5/4.

x_39 = (1.26^4+9)/(10*1.26) = 1.25, which is equal to 5/4.

Therefore, the first term that is less than or equal to 5/4 is x_39. Since all subsequent terms will also be less than or equal to 5/4, there are 1000 - 39 + 1 = 962 terms in the sequence {x_n} that are less than or equal to 5/4.</code></pre>
