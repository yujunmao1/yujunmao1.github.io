<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Polynomial division is a process similar to long division for numbers, but it is used to divide one polynomial by another. The goal of polynomial division is to determine how many times the divisor polynomial can &quot;fit&quot; into the dividend polynomial, and to find the remainder if the division is not exact.

Here&#x27;s the definition and a brief explanation of the terms involved:

**Dividend**: The polynomial that is being divided. This is analogous to the number you start with in numerical long division.

**Divisor**: The polynomial by which you are dividing the dividend. In numerical division, this would be the number you divide by.

**Quotient**: The result of the division, representing how many times the divisor can fit into the dividend without considering the remainder.

**Remainder**: The part of the dividend that is left over after the division process has been completed. If the degree of the remainder is less than the degree of the divisor, the division process is complete.

The process of polynomial division can be done using long division or synthetic division (which is a shortcut method applicable when the divisor is a binomial of the form x - c).

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step outline of the long division process for polynomials:

1. Arrange both the dividend and the divisor polynomials in descending order of their degrees (the highest power of x comes first).

2. Divide the leading term (the term with the highest power of x) of the dividend by the leading term of the divisor. This gives you the first term of the quotient.

3. Multiply the entire divisor by the term you just found and subtract the result from the dividend. This gives you a new polynomial.

4. Repeat the process using the new polynomial as the dividend. Divide the leading term of the new polynomial by the leading term of the divisor to find the next term of the quotient.

5. Continue this process until the degree of the remainder polynomial is less than the degree of the divisor or until the remainder is zero.

6. The final quotient and remainder give you the result of the division, which can be expressed as:

   Dividend = (Divisor Ã— Quotient) + Remainder

For example, if we want to divide the polynomial 2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 by x - 2, we would use polynomial long division to find that the quotient is 2x^2 + 7x + 13 and the remainder is 21. So, the division can be expressed as:

   2x^3 + 3x^2 - x - 5 = (x - 2)(2x^2 + 7x + 13) + 21

Polynomial division is useful in various areas of algebra, including simplifying rational expressions, finding polynomial roots, and solving polynomial equations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, named after the 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat. It provides an important property of integers with respect to prime numbers and is particularly useful in the fields of number theory and cryptography, especially in algorithms like the RSA encryption system.

The theorem states that if \( p \) is a prime number, then for any integer \( a \) such that \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \) (i.e., \( a \) and \( p \) are coprime), the number \( a^{p-1} \) is congruent to 1 modulo \( p \). In the language of congruences, this is written as:

\[ a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ p) \]

In other words, when \( a^{p-1} \) is divided by \( p \), the remainder is 1.

An equivalent formulation of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is that for any integer \( a \), the number \( a^p \) is congruent to \( a \) modulo \( p \). That is:

\[ a^p \equiv a \ (\text{mod} \ p) \]

This second formulation includes the case where \( a \) is divisible by \( p \), as \( a \) modulo \( p \) would be 0, and \( a^p \) would also be divisible by \( p \), hence also congruent to 0 modulo \( p \).

Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is often used to reduce large exponents in modular arithmetic calculations, as it provides a way to work with exponents that are multiples of \( p-1 \) by reducing them modulo \( p-1 \). This is particularly useful in computations involving large prime numbers.

Here&#x27;s a simple example to illustrate the theorem:

Let \( p = 7 \) (which is prime) and \( a = 3 \). According to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( 3^6 \) should be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Indeed, \( 3^6 = 729 \), and when we divide 729 by 7, we get a remainder of 1, which confirms the theorem in this case.

Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is a special case of Euler&#x27;s Totient Theorem, which generalizes the result to composite moduli and involves the Euler totient function \( \phi(n) \).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

If f(x)=x^5-x+a is divisible by x-b for some integer b, what are possible values of a mod 5?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study f(x) at x=b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>If \( f(x) = x^5 - x + a \) is divisible by \( x - b \), then by the Remainder Theorem, \( f(b) \) must be equal to zero. That is, when we substitute \( x \) with \( b \), the polynomial \( f(x) \) should evaluate to zero.

So, let&#x27;s substitute \( x \) with \( b \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ f(b) = b^5 - b + a = 0 \]

Now, we want to find possible values of \( a \) modulo 5. To do this, we can take the entire equation modulo 5:

\[ b^5 - b + a \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \]

By Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, we know that for any integer \( b \) that is not divisible by 5 (a prime number), \( b^4 \equiv 1 \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \). Therefore, \( b^5 \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \) for any integer \( b \).

Using this property, we can simplify the equation:

\[ b - b + a \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \]

This simplifies to:

\[ a \equiv 0 \ (\text{mod} \ 5) \]

So, \( a \) must be congruent to 0 modulo 5. This means that \( a \) could be any integer that is a multiple of 5. The possible values of \( a \) modulo 5 are therefore 0, since all multiples of 5 leave a remainder of 0 when divided by 5.

In conclusion, the possible value of \( a \) modulo 5 is 0.</code></pre>
