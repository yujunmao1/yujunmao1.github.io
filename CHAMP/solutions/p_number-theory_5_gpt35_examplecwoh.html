<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s consider the following example:

Suppose a = 12, b = 3, and c = 4. We want to show that if 3 divides 12 and the greatest common divisor of 3 and 4 is 1, then we can find integers m, n, p, and q such that b = mp, c = nq, gcd(m, n) = gcd(p, q) = 1, and pq = a.

In this case, we have 3 | 12 since 12 is divisible by 3. Additionally, gcd(3, 4) = 1, as 3 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.

To find m, n, p, and q, we can start by factoring a = 12 into its prime factors: 12 = 2^2 * 3.

Now, we can assign m = 2, n = 1, p = 3, and q = 4. Notice that b = mp = 2 * 3 = 6 and c = nq = 1 * 4 = 4. Also, gcd(m, n) = gcd(2, 1) = 1 and gcd(p, q) = gcd(3, 4) = 1.

Finally, we have pq = 3 * 4 = 12, which matches the value of a.

Therefore, in this example, we have shown that if 3 divides 12 and gcd(3, 4) = 1, then we can find integers m, n, p, and q such that b = mp, c = nq, gcd(m, n) = gcd(p, q) = 1, and pq = a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all four-digit automorphic numbers.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all four-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers a such that a^2 ends in a.

Let&#x27;s consider a four-digit automorphic number, which can be written as a = 1000x + 100y + 10z + w, where x, y, z, and w are digits.

We can rewrite this as a = 1000x + 100y + 10z + (1000x + 100y + 10z + w - 1000x - 100y - 10z).

Simplifying, we have a = 1000x + 100y + 10z + (1000x + 100y + 10z + w - 1000x - 100y - 10z) = 1000x + 100y + 10z + (1000x + 100y + 10z) + (w - 1000x - 100y - 10z).

Now, let&#x27;s square both sides of the equation:

a^2 = (1000x + 100y + 10z + (1000x + 100y + 10z) + (w - 1000x - 100y - 10z))^2.

Expanding the square, we get:

a^2 = (1000x + 100y + 10z)^2 + 2(1000x + 100y + 10z)(w - 1000x - 100y - 10z) + (w - 1000x - 100y - 10z)^2.

Since we want a^2 to end in a, the last digit of a^2 must be equal to the last digit of a. Therefore, we can focus on the last digit of each term in the equation above.

The last digit of (1000x + 100y + 10z)^2 will be the same as the last digit of (10z)^2, which is the same as the last digit of (10^2 * z^2), which is the same as the last digit of (100 * z^2), which is z^2.

The last digit of 2(1000x + 100y + 10z)(w - 1000x - 100y - 10z) will be the same as the last digit of 2(10z)(w - 10z), which is the same as the last digit of 2(10z)(w), which is the same as the last digit of 20zw.

The last digit of (w - 1000x - 100y - 10z)^2 will be the same as the last digit of (w - 10z)^2, which is the same as the last digit of (w^2 - 20zw + 100z^2).

Now, let&#x27;s substitute these expressions back into the equation:

a^2 = z^2 + 20zw + (w^2 - 20zw + 100z^2).

Simplifying, we have:

a^2 = z^2 + w^2 + 100z^2.

Since we want a^2 to end in a, the last digit of a^2 must be equal to the last digit of a. Therefore, we can conclude that z^2 + w^2 must be equal to z.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values for z:

If z = 0, then z^2 + w^2 = 0 + w^2 = w^2. This means that w^2 must be equal to 0, which implies that w = 0. However, a four-digit number cannot have a leading zero, so z = 0 is not a valid solution.

If z = 1, then z^2 + w^2 = 1 + w^2 = 1. This means that w^2 must be equal to 0, which implies that w = 0. However, a four-digit number cannot have a leading zero, so z = 1 is not a valid solution.

If z = 2, then z^2 + w^2 = 4 + w^2 = 2. This means that w^2 must be equal to -2, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 2 is not a valid solution.

If z = 3, then z^2 + w^2 = 9 + w^2 = 3. This means that w^2 must be equal to -6, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 3 is not a valid solution.

If z = 4, then z^2 + w^2 = 16 + w^2 = 4. This means that w^2 must be equal to -12, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 4 is not a valid solution.

If z = 5, then z^2 + w^2 = 25 + w^2 = 5. This means that w^2 must be equal to -20, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 5 is not a valid solution.

If z = 6, then z^2 + w^2 = 36 + w^2 = 6. This means that w^2 must be equal to -30, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 6 is not a valid solution.

If z = 7, then z^2 + w^2 = 49 + w^2 = 7. This means that w^2 must be equal to -42, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 7 is not a valid solution.

If z = 8, then z^2 + w^2 = 64 + w^2 = 8. This means that w^2 must be equal to -56, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 8 is not a valid solution.

If z = 9, then z^2 + w^2 = 81 + w^2 = 9. This means that w^2 must be equal to -72, which has no integer solutions. Therefore, z = 9 is not a valid solution.

From the analysis above, we can conclude that there are no four-digit automorphic numbers.

Therefore, there are no four-digit automorphic numbers.</code></pre>
