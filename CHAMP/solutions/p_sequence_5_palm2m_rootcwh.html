Are there prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). If so, what is the smallest one?

You may find the following information useful:

1. 10001=73*137.
2. For even n, let n+1=m and factorize the expression for a_n.
3. a+a*r+a*r^2+...+a*r^n=a(1-r^(n+1))/(1-r), a+a*r+a*r^2+...=a/(1-r).
4. x^2-y^2=(x+y)(x-y).
5. For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.
6. For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.
7. For odd n, let n+1=2k and factorize the expression for a_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Yes, there are prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). The smallest one is 10001000100010001.

To prove this, we will first show that the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by 2. To do this, we will use the following lemma:

Lemma: If $a$ is an integer and $a^n$ is divisible by 2, then $a$ is divisible by 2.

Proof: We can prove this by induction on $n$. The base case is $n=1$. In this case, $a^1=a$, so if $a^1$ is divisible by 2, then $a$ must also be divisible by 2.

Now assume that the lemma is true for some $n\geq 1$. We want to show that it is also true for $n+1$. In other words, we want to show that if $a^n$ is divisible by 2, then $a^{n+1}$ is also divisible by 2.

We have $$a^{n+1}=a^n\cdot a.$$ Since $a^n$ is divisible by 2, and $a$ is an integer, $a^{n+1}$ must also be divisible by 2.

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Now, we can use the lemma to show that the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by 2. To do this, we will show that $a_n$ is never divisible by 2 for any $n$.

We have $$a_n=10001\cdot 10001\cdot 10001\cdots 10001\cdot 10001$$ where there are $n$ factors of 10001. Since 10001 is not divisible by 2, $a_n$ is also not divisible by 2.

Therefore, the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by 2.

Next, we will show that the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by any prime number $p$ greater than 73. To do this, we will use the following lemma:

Lemma: If $a$ is an integer and $a^n$ is divisible by $p$, then $a$ is divisible by $p$.

Proof: We can prove this by induction on $n$. The base case is $n=1$. In this case, $a^1=a$, so if $a^1$ is divisible by $p$, then $a$ must also be divisible by $p$.

Now assume that the lemma is true for some $n\geq 1$. We want to show that it is also true for $n+1$. In other words, we want to show that if $a^n$ is divisible by $p$, then $a^{n+1}$ is also divisible by $p$.

We have $$a^{n+1}=a^n\cdot a.$$ Since $a^n$ is divisible by $p$, and $a$ is an integer, $a^{n+1}$ must also be divisible by $p$.

This completes the proof of the lemma.

Now, we can use the lemma to show that the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by any prime number $p$ greater than 73. To do this, we will show that $a_n$ is never divisible by any prime number $p$ greater than 73 for any $n$.

We have $$a_n=10001\cdot 10001\cdot 10001\cdots 10001\cdot 10001$$ where there are $n$ factors of 10001. Since 10001 is not divisible by any prime number greater than 73, $a_n$ is also not divisible by any prime number greater than 73.

Therefore, the sequence {a_n} is never divisible by any prime number greater than 73.

Finally, we will show that there is a prime number in the</code></pre>
