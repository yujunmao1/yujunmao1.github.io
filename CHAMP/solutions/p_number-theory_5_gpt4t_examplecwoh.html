If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all four-digit automorphic numbers.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all four-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last four digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a four-digit number \( abcd \) (where \( a, b, c, \) and \( d \) are digits and \( a \) is not zero), and let&#x27;s try to find a pattern or a method to determine such numbers.

Since \( a \) is a four-digit number, \( a^2 \) will be at most an eight-digit number. We are interested in the last four digits of \( a^2 \), which means we are looking for a number \( a \) such that:

\[ a^2 \equiv a \mod{10000} \]

This congruence means that \( a^2 - a \) is divisible by \( 10000 \), or equivalently, \( 10000 \) divides \( a(a - 1) \). Since \( 10000 = 2^4 \cdot 5^4 \), we can apply the concept given in the original question:

If \( a \) divides \( bc \) and \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \), then we can find integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

In our case, \( a \) is the number we are looking for, and \( b \) and \( c \) are \( a \) and \( a - 1 \), respectively. Since \( a \) and \( a - 1 \) are consecutive integers, their greatest common divisor is \( 1 \). We can then write \( a = mp \) and \( a - 1 = nq \) with \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \) and \( pq = 10000 \).

The prime factorization of \( 10000 \) is \( 2^4 \cdot 5^4 \), so \( p \) and \( q \) must be powers of \( 2 \) and \( 5 \). The possible pairs \( (p, q) \) are \( (1, 10000) \), \( (2, 5000) \), \( (4, 2500) \), \( (8, 1250) \), \( (16, 625) \), \( (32, 312.5) \), but since \( q \) must be an integer, the pair \( (32, 312.5) \) is not valid. Similarly, \( (64, 156.25) \), \( (128, 78.125) \), and so on are not valid because \( q \) is not an integer.

Let&#x27;s consider the valid pairs and find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( a = mp \) and \( a - 1 = nq \):

1. \( (p, q) = (1, 10000) \): This pair is not possible since \( a \) is a four-digit number and cannot be \( 10000 \).

2. \( (p, q) = (2, 5000) \): This implies \( a \) is even, and \( a - 1 \) is a multiple of \( 5000 \). The only four-digit number that is one less than a multiple of \( 5000 \) is \( 4999 \). However, \( 4999^2 \) does not end in \( 4999 \), so this is not a solution.

3. \( (p, q) = (4, 2500) \): This implies \( a \) is a multiple of \( 4 \), and \( a - 1 \) is a multiple of \( 2500 \). The only four-digit number that is one less than a multiple of \( 2500 \) is \( 2499 \). However, \( 2499^2 \) does not end in \( 2499 \), so this is not a solution.

4. \( (p, q) = (8, 1250) \): This implies \( a \) is a multiple of \( 8 \), and \( a - 1 \) is a multiple of \( 1250 \). The only four-digit number that is one less than a multiple of \( 1250 \) is \( 1249 \). However, \( 1249^2 \) does not end in \( 1249 \), so this is not a solution.

5. \( (p, q) = (16, 625) \): This implies \( a \) is a multiple of \( 16 \), and \( a - 1 \) is a multiple of \( 625 \). The only four-digit number that is one less than a multiple of \( 625 \) is \( 0624 \), \( 1249 \), \( 1874 \), and \( 2499 \). However, \( 0624^2 = 389376 \), \( 1249^2 = 1560001 \), \( 1874^2 = 3511876 \), and \( 2499^2 = 6245001 \), which do not end in \( 0624 \), \( 1249 \), \( 1874 \), or \( 2499 \), respectively, so these are not solutions.

Since none of the valid pairs \( (p, q) \) resulted in a solution, we must conclude that there are no four-digit automorphic numbers.</code></pre>
