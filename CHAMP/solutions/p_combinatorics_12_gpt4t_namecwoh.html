<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem involving permutations with a specific constraint. The constraint is that each driver must be able to park in a lot, which means that for each driver \( i \), the lots \( a_i, a_i + 1, ..., n \) must not all be occupied when driver \( i \) arrives.

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. Let \( P(n) \) be the number of valid sequences for \( n \) parking lots and \( n \) cars. We want to find an expression for \( P(n) \).

Consider the first driver. This driver has \( n \) choices for his favorite parking lot \( a_1 \). Depending on his choice, the problem then breaks down into smaller subproblems:

1. If driver 1 chooses lot 1 (which is always free), then we have a subproblem with \( n-1 \) drivers and \( n-1 \) lots, which has \( P(n-1) \) valid sequences.

2. If driver 1 chooses lot 2, then driver 2 must choose lot 1 (since driver 1 will take lot 2 if it&#x27;s his turn and lot 1 is taken). This leaves us with a subproblem of \( n-2 \) drivers and \( n-2 \) lots, which has \( P(n-2) \) valid sequences.

3. If driver 1 chooses lot 3, then drivers 2 and 3 must choose lots 1 and 2 in some order. There are 2 ways to arrange drivers 2 and 3, and the remaining problem is a subproblem with \( n-3 \) drivers and \( n-3 \) lots, which has \( P(n-3) \) valid sequences.

Continuing this pattern, we see that if driver 1 chooses lot \( k \), there are \( (k-1)! \) ways to arrange drivers 2 through \( k \), and the remaining problem is a subproblem with \( n-k \) drivers and \( n-k \) lots, which has \( P(n-k) \) valid sequences.

Therefore, we can express \( P(n) \) as the sum of the products of the number of ways to arrange the first \( k-1 \) drivers and the number of valid sequences for the remaining \( n-k \) drivers:

\[ P(n) = P(n-1) + 1! \cdot P(n-2) + 2! \cdot P(n-3) + \cdots + (n-2)! \cdot P(1) + (n-1)! \cdot P(0) \]

We also know that \( P(0) = 1 \) because there is exactly one way to arrange zero drivers (the empty sequence).

Now, we can use this recursive formula to compute \( P(n) \). However, we can also recognize that this recursive formula is the definition of the number of permutations of \( n \) elements, also known as the factorial of \( n \):

\[ P(n) = n! \]

This is because the factorial \( n! \) counts the number of ways to arrange \( n \) distinct items, which is exactly the problem we are solving: arranging \( n \) drivers in \( n \) parking lots such that each driver can park.

Therefore, the number of sequences \( \{a_1, ..., a_n\} \) such that every driver can park is \( n! \), the factorial of \( n \).</code></pre>
