<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If an (infinite) sequence converges to a limit, then all (infinite) subsequences converge, and converge to the same limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider the sequence defined by \( a_n = \frac{1}{n} \) for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \). This is an infinite sequence of positive numbers.

The sequence \( (a_n) \) converges to the limit 0 as \( n \) approaches infinity. That is, for every positive number \( \epsilon \), no matter how small, there exists a natural number \( N \) such that for all \( n \geq N \), the inequality \( |a_n - 0| &lt; \epsilon \) holds.

Now, let&#x27;s consider two different subsequences of \( (a_n) \):

1. The subsequence \( (a_{2n}) \), which consists of every second term of the original sequence. So, \( a_{2n} = \frac{1}{2n} \). As \( n \) approaches infinity, \( a_{2n} \) approaches 0, just like the original sequence.

2. The subsequence \( (a_{n^2}) \), which consists of the terms of the original sequence whose indices are perfect squares. So, \( a_{n^2} = \frac{1}{n^2} \). As \( n \) approaches infinity, \( a_{n^2} \) also approaches 0.

In both cases, the subsequences converge to the same limit as the original sequence, which is 0. This illustrates the general principle that if an infinite sequence converges to a limit, then all of its infinite subsequences also converge, and they converge to the same limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series and the sum of an infinite geometric series, respectively.

For the finite geometric series, the sum of the first \( n+1 \) terms of a geometric sequence with initial term \( a \) and common ratio \( r \) (where \( r \neq 1 \)) is given by:

\[ S_n = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^n = \frac{a(1 - r^{n+1})}{1 - r} \]

For the infinite geometric series, if \( |r| &lt; 1 \), the sum of all terms of the geometric sequence is given by:

\[ S = a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

Here&#x27;s an example applying both concepts:

Let&#x27;s take a geometric series with \( a = 3 \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). Since \( |r| &lt; 1 \), we can find both the sum of the first \( n+1 \) terms and the sum of the infinite series.

1. Finite geometric series sum (for \( n = 4 \)):
\[ S_4 = 3 + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^4 \]
\[ S_4 = \frac{3(1 - (\frac{1}{2})^{4+1})}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = \frac{3(1 - \frac{1}{32})}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{31}{32}}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S_4 = 3 \cdot \frac{31}{16} \]
\[ S_4 = \frac{93}{16} \]
\[ S_4 = 5.8125 \]

2. Infinite geometric series sum:
\[ S = \frac{3}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ S = 3 \cdot 2 \]
\[ S = 6 \]

So, the sum of the first five terms of the series (up to \( n = 4 \)) is \( 5.8125 \), and the sum of the entire infinite series is \( 6 \). Notice that as \( n \) increases, the finite sum \( S_n \) gets closer and closer to the infinite sum \( S \).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For aâ‰¤b, define the sequence as a_1=a, a_2=b, a_(n+2)=(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2. Does the limit exist for this sequence, and if so, find it as an expression in terms of a and b.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the relationship between |a_(n+2)-a_(n+1)| and |a_(n+1)-a_n|.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To investigate whether the sequence \( (a_n) \) converges, let&#x27;s first look at the relationship between the absolute differences of consecutive terms:

\[ |a_{n+2} - a_{n+1}| = \left|\frac{a_{n+1} + a_n}{2} - a_{n+1}\right| = \left|\frac{a_n - a_{n+1}}{2}\right| = \frac{1}{2}|a_n - a_{n+1}| \]

This shows that the absolute difference between consecutive terms is halved with each step. Since \( a \leq b \), the sequence is non-decreasing (because each term is the average of the previous two terms, and averaging does not increase the sequence if the sequence is non-decreasing).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sequence of differences \( (d_n) \) where \( d_n = |a_{n+1} - a_n| \). From the above, we have \( d_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}d_n \). This is a geometric sequence with \( d_1 = |b - a| \) and a common ratio of \( \frac{1}{2} \). Since the common ratio is less than 1, the sequence of differences \( (d_n) \) converges to 0.

As the differences between consecutive terms approach 0, the sequence \( (a_n) \) must be approaching a limit, say \( L \). To find \( L \), we can use the fact that if the sequence converges, then the terms of the sequence and the limit must satisfy the same recurrence relation:

\[ L = \frac{L + L}{2} \]

Solving for \( L \) gives us \( L = L \), which is true for any \( L \). This means that the limit exists, but we haven&#x27;t found its value yet. To find the value of \( L \), we need to consider the behavior of the sequence.

Since the sequence is non-decreasing and bounded above (by \( b \), since we are averaging terms and starting with \( a \leq b \)), it must converge to its supremum by the Monotone Convergence Theorem. The supremum of the sequence is the least upper bound of the set of its terms.

Given that the differences between terms are halving each time and the sequence is non-decreasing, the sequence is getting closer and closer to the average of \( a \) and \( b \). In the limit, the sequence cannot exceed this average, because that would imply that there exists a pair of terms whose average is greater than the average of \( a \) and \( b \), which is not possible given the construction of the sequence.

Therefore, the limit of the sequence \( (a_n) \) is the average of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[ L = \frac{a + b}{2} \]

This is the final answer: the limit of the sequence \( (a_n) \) exists and is equal to \( \frac{a + b}{2} \).</code></pre>
