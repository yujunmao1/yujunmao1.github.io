<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 4?

You may find the following information useful:

1. a+a*r+a*r^2+...+a*r^n=a(1-r^(n+1))/(1-r), a+a*r+a*r^2+...=a/(1-r).
2. If a | b and b | c, then a | c.
3. For integer a, b with a&gt;b, gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, a-b). </code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation given is x^2 + y^2 = z^2, which is a Pythagorean equation. We are looking for integer solutions (x, y, z) and want to know how many of these numbers must be divisible by 4.

First, let&#x27;s consider the parity of x, y, and z. If x and y were both odd, then their squares would be odd as well (since the square of an odd number is odd). Adding two odd numbers would give an even number, so z^2 would be even, meaning z would also be even. However, the sum of two odd squares would be congruent to 2 mod 4, which cannot be a perfect square since all squares are congruent to 0 or 1 mod 4. Therefore, it&#x27;s impossible for both x and y to be odd.

If one of x or y is even and the other is odd, then their squares would be even and odd, respectively, and the sum would be odd, which cannot equal z^2 since z^2 must be even if z is an integer. Therefore, both x and y cannot be of opposite parity.

The only remaining possibility is that both x and y are even. If x and y are both even, then z must also be even because the sum of two even squares is even, and the square root of an even number is even.

Now, let&#x27;s consider divisibility by 4. If x and y are both even, we can write x = 2a and y = 2b, where a and b are integers. Substituting these into the equation, we get:

(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 = z^2
4a^2 + 4b^2 = z^2
4(a^2 + b^2) = z^2

Since 4 divides the left side of the equation, 4 must also divide z^2, which means z must be even. However, this does not guarantee that z is divisible by 4. For z to be divisible by 4, z^2 must be divisible by 16.

Let&#x27;s assume z is not divisible by 4, which means z is of the form 2k where k is an odd integer. Then z^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2. Since k is odd, k^2 is odd, and 4k^2 is not divisible by 16, which contradicts the fact that 4(a^2 + b^2) must be divisible by 16 for the equation to hold.

Therefore, z must be divisible by 4. Since x and y are both even, at least one of them must also be divisible by 4 to ensure that their squares sum up to a number whose square is divisible by 16.

In conclusion, at least two of the numbers x, y, and z must be divisible by 4 for the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 to have an integer solution.</code></pre>
