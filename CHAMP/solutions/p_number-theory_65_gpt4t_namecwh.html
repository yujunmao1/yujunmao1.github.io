<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: square of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formulas are algebraic identities that describe the expansion of the square of a sum or difference of two terms. These formulas are very useful in simplifying algebraic expressions and solving equations. Here are the formulas:

1. Square of a sum formula:
The square of a sum formula states that the square of the sum of two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers plus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²

This formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a + b) by itself:

(a + b)(a + b) = a² + ab + ba + b²
               = a² + ab + ab + b²
               = a² + 2ab + b²

2. Square of a difference formula:
The square of a difference formula states that the square of the difference between two numbers a and b is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers minus twice the product of the two numbers. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

(a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²

Similarly, this formula can be derived by multiplying the binomial (a - b) by itself:

(a - b)(a - b) = a² - ab - ba + b²
               = a² - ab - ab + b²
               = a² - 2ab + b²

These formulas are part of the larger family of binomial expansion formulas and are particularly helpful in simplifying expressions without having to perform the full binomial multiplication. They are also used in various mathematical applications, including geometry, calculus, and number theory.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:

a ≡ b (mod n)

This means that when a and b are divided by n, they leave the same remainder.

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n). In other words, the sum of two congruent numbers is also congruent to the sum of their respective equivalents.

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n). Similar to addition, the difference between two congruent numbers is congruent to the difference of their respective equivalents.

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n). The product of two congruent numbers is congruent to the product of their respective equivalents.

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), it is not necessarily true that a/c ≡ b/d (mod n). Division is only valid if the divisor is coprime with the modulus (i.e., the divisor and the modulus share no common factors other than 1). In such cases, you can multiply by the multiplicative inverse of the divisor modulo n to &quot;divide.&quot;

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then for any positive integer k, a^k ≡ b^k (mod n). The power of a congruent number is congruent to the power of its equivalent.

7. Modular Inverses:
An integer a has a modular multiplicative inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that (a * x) ≡ 1 (mod n). Not every number has a modular inverse; a number a has an inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime.

These rules make modular arithmetic a powerful tool in various fields of mathematics and computer science, especially in number theory, cryptography, and for performing computations with large numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all prime number solutions to the equation p^2-2*q^2=1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. All prime numbers greater than 3 has the form of 6n±1.
2. Consider the equation modulo 6 for p,q&gt;3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s analyze the given equation:

\[ p^2 - 2q^2 = 1 \]

We are looking for prime number solutions, so p and q must be prime numbers. We know that all prime numbers greater than 3 are of the form 6n ± 1. Let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo 6 for p, q &gt; 3.

First, let&#x27;s look at the possible remainders when squaring numbers that are congruent to ±1 modulo 6:

- If a number is of the form 6n + 1, then its square is (6n + 1)² = 36n² + 12n + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 6).
- If a number is of the form 6n - 1, then its square is (6n - 1)² = 36n² - 12n + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 6).

So, regardless of whether a prime number is 6n + 1 or 6n - 1, its square will be congruent to 1 modulo 6.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo 6:

\[ p^2 - 2q^2 ≡ 1 \mod 6 \]

Since p^2 ≡ 1 (mod 6) and q^2 ≡ 1 (mod 6) for primes greater than 3, we can substitute these congruences into the equation:

\[ 1 - 2(1) ≡ 1 \mod 6 \]
\[ -1 ≡ 1 \mod 6 \]

This is clearly not true, as -1 is not congruent to 1 modulo 6. Therefore, there are no solutions for p and q both being primes greater than 3.

However, we must consider the primes that are not greater than 3, which are 2 and 3. Let&#x27;s check these cases:

For p = 2:
\[ 2^2 - 2q^2 = 1 \]
\[ 4 - 2q^2 = 1 \]
\[ 2q^2 = 3 \]
\[ q^2 = \frac{3}{2} \]

Since q^2 must be an integer, there is no solution for p = 2.

For p = 3:
\[ 3^2 - 2q^2 = 1 \]
\[ 9 - 2q^2 = 1 \]
\[ 2q^2 = 8 \]
\[ q^2 = 4 \]
\[ q = 2 \]

We have found a solution: p = 3 and q = 2.

Therefore, the only prime number solution to the equation p^2 - 2q^2 = 1 is (p, q) = (3, 2).</code></pre>
