<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are the basic rules and concepts of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers `a` and `b` are said to be congruent modulo `n` if their difference `a - b` is an integer multiple of `n`. This is denoted as `a ≡ b (mod n)`. For example, 38 is congruent to 14 modulo 12 because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n)`.
- Subtraction: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n)`.
- Multiplication: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n)`.

3. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. An integer `a` can be divided by an integer `b` modulo `n` if there exists an integer `b&#x27;` such that `b * b&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. The integer `b&#x27;` is called the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `n`. If such a `b&#x27;` exists, then `a / b ≡ a * b&#x27; (mod n)`.

4. Modular Inverses:
An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if there exists an integer `a&#x27;` such that `a * a&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Not every integer has a modular inverse. An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if and only if `a` and `n` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

5. Properties:
- The set of integers modulo `n` forms a complete set of residues from `0` to `n-1`. Any integer is congruent to exactly one of these residues.
- Modular arithmetic preserves the usual properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The distributive law holds in modular arithmetic: `a * (b + c) ≡ (a * b) + (a * c) (mod n)`.

6. Applications:
Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is essential for algorithms involving hashing, pseudo-random number generation, and for the arithmetic of large numbers as in RSA encryption.

Understanding these rules allows you to perform arithmetic computations with integers in a modular system, which can be visualized as a circle with `n` points, where `n` is the modulus. When you reach the `n`-th point, you wrap around back to zero, much like the hours on a clock.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all integer solutions to the equation 15x^2-7y^2=9.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study y mod 3 and define y=3u+a for some value of a accordingly.
2. Study x mod 3 and define x=3u+b for some value of b accordingly.
3. Consider the resulting equation modulo 3.
4. For integer n, n^2 mod 3 is either 0 or 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all integer solutions to the equation \( 15x^2 - 7y^2 = 9 \), we can use modular arithmetic and the given hints.

First, let&#x27;s consider \( y \mod 3 \). Since \( y^2 \mod 3 \) can only be 0 or 1 (because for any integer \( n \), \( n^2 \mod 3 \) is either 0 or 1), we can deduce that \( y \mod 3 \) can only be 0 or ±1. Therefore, we can write \( y \) as \( y = 3u + a \), where \( a \) is either 0 or ±1.

Similarly, for \( x \mod 3 \), since \( x^2 \mod 3 \) can only be 0 or 1, \( x \mod 3 \) can also only be 0 or ±1. We can write \( x \) as \( x = 3v + b \), where \( b \) is either 0 or ±1.

Now, let&#x27;s substitute these expressions into the original equation:

\[ 15(3v + b)^2 - 7(3u + a)^2 = 9 \]

Expanding both terms, we get:

\[ 15(9v^2 + 6vb + b^2) - 7(9u^2 + 6ua + a^2) = 9 \]

Simplifying, we have:

\[ 135v^2 + 90vb + 15b^2 - 63u^2 - 42ua - 7a^2 = 9 \]

Now, let&#x27;s consider this equation modulo 3. We know that any multiple of 3 is congruent to 0 modulo 3, so we can ignore the terms with a factor of 9. We are left with:

\[ 15b^2 - 7a^2 \equiv 9 \mod 3 \]

Reducing each term modulo 3, we get:

\[ 0b^2 - a^2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \]

Since \( b^2 \) and \( 9 \) are both congruent to 0 modulo 3, we can simplify further:

\[ -a^2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \]

This implies that \( a^2 \) must be divisible by 3. Given that \( a \) is either 0 or ±1, the only value of \( a \) that satisfies this condition is 0 (since \( 1^2 \) and \( (-1)^2 \) are not divisible by 3). Therefore, \( y \) must be a multiple of 3, and we can write \( y = 3u \).

Now, let&#x27;s substitute \( a = 0 \) back into the equation and consider \( b \):

\[ 15b^2 - 7(3u)^2 = 9 \]

\[ 15b^2 - 63u^2 = 9 \]

\[ 15b^2 = 63u^2 + 9 \]

\[ 5b^2 = 21u^2 + 3 \]

Considering this equation modulo 3, we get:

\[ 5b^2 \equiv 0 \mod 3 \]

Since 5 is not divisible by 3, \( b^2 \) must be divisible by 3 for the equation to hold. However, we know that \( b^2 \mod 3 \) can only be 0 or 1, and it can only be 0 if \( b \) itself is a multiple of 3. Therefore, \( b \) must also be 0.

Now we have \( x = 3v \) and \( y = 3u \), and we can substitute these back into the original equation:

\[ 15(3v)^2 - 7(3u)^2 = 9 \]

\[ 135v^2 - 63u^2 = 9 \]

\[ 15v^2 - 7u^2 = 1 \]

This is a Diophantine equation of the form \( Ax^2 - By^2 = C \), which can have an infinite number of solutions. However, finding all solutions to this equation is not straightforward and typically requires more advanced techniques such as continued fractions or other number-theoretic methods.

In summary, we have shown that any solution to the original equation must have both \( x \) and \( y \) as multiples of 3. The last equation \( 15v^2 - 7u^2 = 1 \) is a simplified form that needs further analysis to find all integer solutions for \( v \) and \( u \), and consequently for \( x \) and \( y \).</code></pre>
