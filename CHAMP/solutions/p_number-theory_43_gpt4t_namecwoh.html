<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 3 is a simple arithmetic test to determine whether a given integer is divisible by 3. According to this rule, an integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Here&#x27;s how you can apply the rule:

1. Take any integer and add up all of its digits.
2. Look at the sum you&#x27;ve obtained. If this sum is divisible by 3 (i.e., if it is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.), then the original integer is also divisible by 3.
3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, then the original integer is not divisible by 3.

For example, let&#x27;s determine whether the number 12345 is divisible by 3:

1. Add the digits of the number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
2. Determine if the sum is divisible by 3: Since 15 is divisible by 3 (15 รท 3 = 5), the original number, 12345, is also divisible by 3.

This rule is based on the fact that 3 is a factor of 9, and any number that is a multiple of 9 has a digit sum that is also a multiple of 9. Since 3 is a factor of 9, any number with a digit sum that is a multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 3. This property can be extended to any digit sum that is a multiple of 3, not just 9.

The divisibility rule for 3 is particularly useful because it allows you to quickly determine divisibility without having to perform long division. It&#x27;s a handy mental math trick that can be used in various mathematical problems and applications.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, named after the 17th-century French mathematician Pierre de Fermat. It provides an important property of numbers when dealing with modular arithmetic, particularly in the context of prime numbers.

The theorem states that if \( p \) is a prime number, then for any integer \( a \) that is not divisible by \( p \), the following congruence relation holds:

\[ a^{(p-1)} \equiv 1 \mod p \]

In other words, if you raise \( a \) to the power of \( p-1 \) and then divide by \( p \), the remainder is 1.

An equivalent way of stating Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is that \( a^p \equiv a \mod p \) for any integer \( a \), whether or not it is divisible by \( p \). This form is sometimes more convenient, depending on the context.

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the theorem:

Let&#x27;s take \( p = 7 \) (which is a prime number) and \( a = 3 \). According to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( 3^{(7-1)} \) or \( 3^6 \) should be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Indeed, \( 3^6 = 729 \), and when you divide 729 by 7, the remainder is 1.

Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is widely used in the field of cryptography, particularly in algorithms like RSA, where the computation of large powers modulo a prime is a common operation. It is also used in primality testing and in the construction of hash functions.

A special case of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is when \( a = 2 \). It states that \( 2^{(p-1)} \) will be congruent to 1 modulo \( p \) if \( p \) is prime. This special case is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fermat-Euler Two Squares Theorem&quot; or simply the &quot;Two Squares Theorem.&quot;

It&#x27;s important to note that the converse of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is not generally true; that is, if \( a^{(p-1)} \equiv 1 \mod p \) for some \( a \) and \( p \), it does not necessarily mean that \( p \) is prime. Numbers that satisfy this condition but are not prime are known as Carmichael numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the properties of the sequence and the divisibility of its terms. We are forming a sequence by appending one digit from 0 to 8 to the previous number, which means we are effectively multiplying the previous number by 10 and adding a digit \( d \) (where \( 0 \leq d \leq 8 \)).

Let&#x27;s denote the initial number as \( x_1 \), and the \( i \)-th number in the sequence as \( x_i \). Then, we can express \( x_{i+1} \) in terms of \( x_i \) as follows:

\[ x_{i+1} = 10 \cdot x_i + d \]

where \( d \) is the appended digit.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime number 3. If \( x_1 \) is not divisible by 3, we can choose \( d \) such that \( x_2 \) becomes divisible by 3. This is possible because appending a digit to a number is equivalent to adding a certain multiple of 1, 10, 100, etc., and we can always find a multiple of 1, 10, 100, etc., that when added to \( x_1 \), makes the sum divisible by 3.

For example, if \( x_1 \) gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, we can append the digit 2 (since \( 10 \cdot x_1 + 2 \) will then be divisible by 3). If \( x_1 \) gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, we can append the digit 1.

Once we have \( x_2 \) divisible by 3, every subsequent number in the sequence will also be divisible by 3. This is because if \( x_i \) is divisible by 3, then \( 10 \cdot x_i \) is also divisible by 3 (since 10 is not divisible by 3, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because we&#x27;re multiplying it by something already divisible by 3), and adding any digit from 0 to 8 will not change the divisibility by 3 (since we&#x27;re just adding a number that is not a multiple of 3 to a multiple of 3).

Therefore, once we have a number in the sequence that is divisible by 3, all subsequent numbers will be composite because they will all be divisible by 3. This means that there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the sequence; once we hit the first composite number, all following numbers will also be composite.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>No, there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the sequence; once a composite number appears, all subsequent numbers will also be composite due to the divisibility by 3.</code></pre>
