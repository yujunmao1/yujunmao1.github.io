<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical expression that allows us to factorize a quadratic expression that is in the form of a difference between two perfect squares. It states that:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

In this formula, &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; represent any real numbers or variables. The left side of the equation represents the difference between the squares of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, while the right side represents the factored form of the expression.

To understand why this formula works, let&#x27;s expand the right side of the equation:

(a + b)(a - b) = a(a) + a(-b) + b(a) + b(-b)
               = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

As you can see, the expanded form of the right side matches the left side of the equation, which confirms that the formula is correct.

The difference of squares formula is particularly useful when we encounter quadratic expressions that can be written as the difference between two perfect squares. By factoring the expression using this formula, we can simplify it and potentially solve equations or simplify further calculations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a branch of mathematics that deals with numbers and their remainders when divided by a fixed positive integer called the modulus. The concept of modular arithmetic is based on the idea that numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they exceed the modulus.

Modular arithmetic rules are a set of properties and operations that apply specifically to modular arithmetic. Here are some important rules:

1. Addition: If a and b are two numbers, then (a + b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n. In other words, to find the sum of two numbers modulo n, you can first find the remainder of each number when divided by n, add them together, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

2. Subtraction: If a and b are two numbers, then (a - b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) - (b mod n)) mod n. Similar to addition, you can find the difference of two numbers modulo n by first finding the remainders of each number when divided by n, subtracting them, and then taking the remainder of the result when divided by n.

3. Multiplication: If a and b are two numbers, then (a * b) mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n) * (b mod n)) mod n. To find the product of two numbers modulo n, you can find the remainders of each number when divided by n, multiply them together, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

4. Exponentiation: If a is a number and k is a positive integer, then a^k mod n is equivalent to ((a mod n)^k) mod n. To find the result of raising a number to a power modulo n, you can first find the remainder of the base when divided by n, raise it to the power of k, and then take the remainder of the result when divided by n.

These rules are particularly useful in various areas of mathematics, computer science, and cryptography, where modular arithmetic is commonly applied. They allow us to perform calculations efficiently and work with remainders in a systematic way.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |36^m - 5^n|, we need to consider different values of m and n and calculate the corresponding absolute difference.

Let&#x27;s start by considering small values of m and n and see if we can find a pattern:

For m = 1 and n = 1:
|36^1 - 5^1| = |36 - 5| = 31

For m = 1 and n = 2:
|36^1 - 5^2| = |36 - 25| = 11

For m = 2 and n = 1:
|36^2 - 5^1| = |1296 - 5| = 1291

For m = 2 and n = 2:
|36^2 - 5^2| = |1296 - 25| = 1271

From these calculations, we can observe that as m and n increase, the difference |36^m - 5^n| tends to decrease. However, it is not immediately clear which combination of m and n will yield the smallest value.

To find the smallest value, we would need to systematically calculate the differences for various values of m and n. However, this process can be time-consuming and may not lead to a clear pattern.

Alternatively, we can use the concept of modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Notice that 36^m and 5^n are both positive integers. Therefore, the absolute difference |36^m - 5^n| will always be positive.

Since we are looking for the smallest value, we can conclude that the smallest value of |36^m - 5^n| occurs when 36^m is closest to 5^n.

To find the closest values, we can take the logarithm of both sides:

m*log(36) ≈ n*log(5)

Simplifying further:

m ≈ (n*log(5))/log(36)

Since m and n are positive integers, we can try different values of n and calculate the corresponding value of m using the equation above. We can then calculate the absolute difference |36^m - 5^n| for each pair of m and n.

By trying different values, we find that when n = 3 and m = 2, the absolute difference is minimized:

|36^2 - 5^3| = |1296 - 125| = 1171

Therefore, the smallest value of |36^m - 5^n| is 1171 when m = 2 and n = 3.</code></pre>
