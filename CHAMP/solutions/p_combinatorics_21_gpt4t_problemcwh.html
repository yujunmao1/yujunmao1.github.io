<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select quadruple (x, y, z, u), with duplicate allowed, such that u&gt;max(x, y, z). In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For u=i, there are i-1 values of x, y and z satisfying u&gt;max(x, y, z), so we have (i-1)^3 triples of valid (x, y, z, u).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^3=sum_(i=1)^n i^3.

Problem: 2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.
Step-wise solution:
1. We can order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n), which can be done in (2n)! ways.
2. The different order of the two players within each pair (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)) result in the same pairing.
3. Thus, we need divide the number of ways by 2^n, since we have n pairs.
4. In addition, the ordering of the pairs also results in duplicate pairing, and there are n! ordering.
5. So in total, we have (2n)!/(2^n*n!) distinct pairings.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select triple (x, y, z), with duplicate allowed, such that z&gt;max(x, y). In how many ways can this be done, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For z=i, there are i-1 values of x and y satisfying z&gt;max(x, y), so we have (i-1)^2 triples of valid (x, y, z).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^2=sum_(i=1)^n i^2.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of the cube and how they affect the colorings. We will use Burnside&#x27;s Lemma, which states that the number of distinct colorings up to symmetry is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group actions. In this case, the group actions are the rotations of the cube.

The cube has 24 different rotations: 6 rotations around an axis through the centers of opposite faces (1 identity rotation, 3 rotations of 90 degrees, 1 rotation of 180 degrees, and 1 rotation of 270 degrees), 8 rotations around an axis through the midpoints of opposite edges (2 rotations of 180 degrees for each of the 4 axes), and 8 rotations around an axis through opposite vertices (3 rotations of 120 degrees and 3 rotations of 240 degrees for each of the 2 axes).

Let&#x27;s analyze each case:

1. Identity rotation (1 rotation): Every coloring is fixed under the identity rotation, so there are 6! fixed points because there are 6 faces and 6 colors.

2. Rotations through centers of opposite faces (9 rotations of 90, 180, and 270 degrees): These rotations will only fix a coloring if the opposite faces are the same color, which is not possible in our case since all faces are different colors. So there are 0 fixed points for each of these rotations.

3. Rotations through midpoints of opposite edges (6 rotations of 180 degrees): Each rotation fixes the colors of the two faces perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The other four faces must be in two pairs of the same color, which again is not possible. So there are 0 fixed points for each of these rotations.

4. Rotations through opposite vertices (8 rotations of 120 and 240 degrees): These rotations fix a coloring if the three faces adjacent to each vertex are the same set of three colors. However, since all faces are different colors, there are 0 fixed points for each of these rotations.

Now we can apply Burnside&#x27;s Lemma:

Number of distinct colorings = (1/24) * (Number of fixed points under all rotations)
= (1/24) * (6! * 1 + 9 * 0 + 6 * 0 + 8 * 0)
= (1/24) * 720
= 30

So there are 30 distinct colorings of the cube up to rotations.</code></pre>
