<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the formula for the sum of a geometric series. A geometric series is a series of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). The formula you&#x27;ve provided gives the sum of the first n+1 terms of a geometric series (finite geometric series) and the sum of an infinite geometric series, respectively.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example:

Suppose we have a geometric series where the first term (a) is 3 and the common ratio (r) is 1/2. We want to find the sum of the first 5 terms and the sum of the series as it goes to infinity.

First, let&#x27;s find the sum of the first 5 terms (n=4, because we start counting from n=0):

a + a*r + a*r^2 + a*r^3 + a*r^4 = a(1 - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values we have:

3 + 3*(1/2) + 3*(1/2)^2 + 3*(1/2)^3 + 3*(1/2)^4 = 3(1 - (1/2)^(4+1)) / (1 - 1/2)

Now, calculate the right side:

= 3(1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2)
= 3(1 - 1/32) / (1/2)
= 3(31/32) / (1/2)
= 3 * 31/32 * 2/1
= 93/16
= 5.8125

So, the sum of the first 5 terms of the series is 5.8125.

Now, let&#x27;s find the sum of the series as it goes to infinity. This is possible because the common ratio is between -1 and 1 (|r| &lt; 1), which means the terms get smaller and smaller, allowing the series to converge to a finite sum.

a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... = a / (1 - r)

Again, plugging in the values we have:

3 + 3*(1/2) + 3*(1/2)^2 + ... = 3 / (1 - 1/2)

Calculate the right side:

= 3 / (1/2)
= 3 * 2/1
= 6

So, the sum of the series to infinity is 6.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the positivity of P(x) when x≤0.
2. For x&gt;0, study the positivity of x*P(x)+P(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine for how many values of \( n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \) the polynomial \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root, we can use the properties of polynomials and the given hints.

First, let&#x27;s study the positivity of \( P(x) \) when \( x \leq 0 \):

The polynomial \( P(x) \) is defined as:
\[ P(x) = x^{2n} - 2x^{2n-1} + 3x^{2n-2} - 4x^{2n-3} + \ldots - 2nx + 2n + 1 \]

When \( x \leq 0 \), all the terms of the form \( x^{2k} \) where \( k \) is an integer will be non-negative since an even power of a negative number is positive. The terms of the form \( -2kx^{2k-1} \) will also be non-negative since the negative sign will cancel out with the negative sign of \( x \) raised to an odd power. The constant term \( 2n + 1 \) is always positive. Therefore, \( P(x) \) is a sum of non-negative terms when \( x \leq 0 \), which implies that \( P(x) &gt; 0 \) for \( x \leq 0 \).

Next, let&#x27;s study the positivity of \( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) \) for \( x &gt; 0 \):

\[ x \cdot P(x) + P(x) = x(x^{2n} - 2x^{2n-1} + 3x^{2n-2} - \ldots - 2nx + 2n + 1) + (x^{2n} - 2x^{2n-1} + 3x^{2n-2} - \ldots - 2nx + 2n + 1) \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ x \cdot P(x) + P(x) = x^{2n+1} - x^{2n} + x^{2n} - 2x^{2n-1} + 2x^{2n-1} - 3x^{2n-2} + \ldots - x + 2n + 1 + 2n + 1 \]

Notice that many terms cancel out, and we are left with:
\[ x \cdot P(x) + P(x) = x^{2n+1} - x + 4n + 2 \]

For \( x &gt; 0 \), the term \( x^{2n+1} \) is positive and dominates the polynomial for sufficiently large \( x \). The term \( -x \) is negative, but its impact diminishes for large \( x \). The constant term \( 4n + 2 \) is always positive. Therefore, for large enough \( x \), \( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) &gt; 0 \).

Now, since \( P(x) &gt; 0 \) for \( x \leq 0 \) and \( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) &gt; 0 \) for large \( x &gt; 0 \), the only possibility for \( P(x) \) to have a real root is if \( P(x) \) becomes negative for some \( x &gt; 0 \) before it eventually becomes positive as \( x \) increases.

The polynomial \( P(x) \) is continuous and differentiable, so if \( P(x) \) has a real root, it must cross the x-axis. This means that there must be a local maximum of \( P(x) \) that is positive and a local minimum that is negative (or zero if the root is at the local minimum).

To find the local extrema, we would typically take the derivative of \( P(x) \) and set it equal to zero. However, the problem does not require us to find the actual roots or the number of roots, just to determine if there is at least one real root.

Since \( P(x) \) is a polynomial of degree \( 2n \) with a positive leading coefficient, it will open upwards, and its end behavior will be such that \( P(x) \to \infty \) as \( x \to \infty \) and \( P(x) \to \infty \) as \( x \to -\infty \). Given that \( P(x) &gt; 0 \) for \( x \leq 0 \) and \( x \cdot P(x) + P(x) &gt; 0 \) for large \( x &gt; 0 \), there must be a change in sign of \( P(x) \) for some \( x &gt; 0 \) if \( P(x) \) has a real root.

Since the polynomial \( P(x) \) has terms with alternating signs, it is possible for \( P(x) \) to have a local minimum that is negative, which would give us a real root. However, without further information on the behavior of \( P(x) \) for all \( x &gt; 0 \), we cannot conclusively determine the number of values of \( n \) for which \( P(x) \) has at least one real root.

To proceed, we would need to analyze the behavior of \( P(x) \) in more detail, possibly by examining the derivatives of \( P(x) \) or by using other methods to determine the number of real roots. However, this analysis goes beyond the scope of the initial problem statement and the hints provided.</code></pre>
