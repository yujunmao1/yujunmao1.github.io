Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

I hope this helps!</code></pre>

Suppose you want to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear. There are 5 different shirts to choose from, 3 different pants to choose from, and 2 different shoes to choose from. No two items can be worn at the same time, so you can&#x27;t wear a shirt and pants at the same time, or a shirt and shoes at the same time. So, there are $5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to choose a car, a house, and a pet. There are 10 different cars to choose from, 5 different houses to choose from, and 3 different pets to choose from. No two items can be owned at the same time, so you can&#x27;t own a car and a house at the same time, or a car and a pet at the same time. So, there are $10 \times 5 \times 3 = 150$ ways to choose a car, a house, and a pet.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.
2. Find f(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).
3. Find g(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $f(n)$ be the number of length-$n$ strings that end with 1 and $g(n)$ be the number of length-$n$ strings that end with either 2 or 3. We can find $f(n+1)$ in terms of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ as follows:

* There are $f(n)$ ways to end the string with 1, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits for the next digit.
* There are $g(n)$ ways to end the string with either 2 or 3, followed by any of the $2$ possible digits for the next digit.

So, $f(n+1) = f(n) + 3g(n)$.

We can find $g(n+1)$ in terms of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ as follows:

* There are $g(n)$ ways to end the string with either 2 or 3, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits for the next digit.
* There are $f(n)$ ways to end the string with 1, followed by any of the $2$ possible digits for the next digit.

So, $g(n+1) = g(n) + 2f(n)$.

We can use this to find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors. Let $h(n)$ be the number of such strings. We have $h(0) = 1$, since there is only one way to form a string of length 0 with no two 1s as neighbors. For $n \ge 1$, we have

$$h(n) = f(n-1) + g(n-1) - f(n-2) - g(n-2).$$

This is because there are $f(n-1)$ ways to form a string of length $n$ that ends with 1, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits for the next digit, and then any of the $2$ possible digits for the next digit, and so on. There are $g(n-1)$ ways to form a string of length $n$ that ends with either 2 or 3, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits for the next digit, and then any of the $2$ possible digits for the next digit, and so on. However, we need to subtract the number of strings that end with 11, which is $f(n-2)$, and the number of strings that end with 22 or 33, which is $g(n-2)$.

Solving this recurrence relation, we get

$$h(n) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 3^n + 2^n - 5 \right).$$

Therefore, the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors is $\frac{1}{6} \left( 3^5 + 2^5 - 5 \right) = \boxed{105}$.</code></pre>
