<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable and the 5 other trees as indistinguishable. We can represent the arrangement of the trees as a row of 5 dots, with 3 dividers placed in between and/or at the two ends.

For example, a valid arrangement could be represented as: . | . | . | . | .

Now, let&#x27;s count the total number of possible arrangements. We have 8 objects (3 apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees) to arrange in a row. This can be done in 8! (8 factorial) ways.

Next, let&#x27;s count the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other. We can think of this as placing the 3 apple trees in between the 5 dots, represented by the dividers. We have 5 spaces between the dots and 2 spaces at the ends where the dividers can be placed.

Using the concept of combinations, we can choose 3 out of the 7 available spaces (5 spaces between the dots + 2 spaces at the ends) to place the dividers. This can be calculated as C(7, 3).

Therefore, the number of arrangements where no two apple trees are next to each other is C(7, 3).

Finally, the probability of no two apple trees being next to each other is the number of valid arrangements divided by the total number of possible arrangements:

Probability = C(7, 3) / 8!

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the final answer:

C(7, 3) = 7! / (3! * (7-3)!) = 7! / (3! * 4!) = (7 * 6 * 5) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 35

8! = 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 40,320

Probability = 35 / 40,320 â‰ˆ 0.000868

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is approximately 0.000868.</code></pre>
