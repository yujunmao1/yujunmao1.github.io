An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all four-digit automorphic numbers.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider the last four digit of a^2-a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all four-digit automorphic numbers, we need to consider the last four digits of a^2 - a.

Let&#x27;s start by expanding (a^2 - a) using the distributive property:
a^2 - a = a(a - 1)

Since we are looking for four-digit automorphic numbers, we know that a must be a four-digit number. Let&#x27;s assume a = 1000x + 100y + 10z + w, where x, y, z, and w are digits.

Substituting this into the expression for a^2 - a, we get:
a^2 - a = (1000x + 100y + 10z + w)((1000x + 100y + 10z + w) - 1)
          = (1000x + 100y + 10z + w)(1000x + 100y + 10z + w - 1)

Expanding this expression, we get:
a^2 - a = 1000000x^2 + 100000x(2y + 1) + 10000(2z + 1)(x + y) + 1000(2w + 1)(x + y + z) + 100(x + y + z)(w - 1) + 10(x + y + z)(w - 1) + (x + y + z)(w - 1)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the last four digits of a^2 - a. We can ignore the terms with higher powers of 10 since they won&#x27;t affect the last four digits.

The last four digits of a^2 - a are given by:
1000(2w + 1)(x + y + z) + 100(x + y + z)(w - 1) + 10(x + y + z)(w - 1) + (x + y + z)(w - 1)

For a four-digit automorphic number, the last four digits of a^2 - a must be equal to a. Therefore, we have the equation:
1000(2w + 1)(x + y + z) + 100(x + y + z)(w - 1) + 10(x + y + z)(w - 1) + (x + y + z)(w - 1) = 1000x + 100y + 10z + w

Simplifying this equation, we get:
2000wx + 2000wy + 2000wz + 2000w + 100x + 100y + 100z + 100w - 100x - 100y - 100z - 100 + 10x + 10y + 10z + 10w - 10x - 10y - 10z - 10 + x + y + z - x - y - z - 1 = 1000x + 100y + 10z + w

Simplifying further, we get:
2000wx + 2000wy + 2000wz + 2000w + 100w - 100 + 10w - 10 + w - 1 = 1000x + 100y + 10z + w

Combining like terms, we have:
2000wx + 2000wy + 2000wz + 2110w - 111 = 1000x + 100y + 10z

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possible values for w. Since w is a digit, it can only take values from 0 to 9.

Case 1: w = 0
In this case, the equation becomes:
2000wx + 2000wy + 2000wz + 2110w - 111 = 1000x + 100y + 10z

Simplifying further, we get:
2000y + 2000z - 111 = 1000x + 100y + 10z

This equation does not have any solutions for x, y, and z that satisfy the condition of being four-digit numbers.

Case 2: w = 1
In this case, the equation becomes:
2000x + 2000y + 2000z + 3110 = 1000x + 100y + 10z

Simplifying further, we get:
1000x + 1900y + 1990z = 3110

To find the solutions for x, y, and z, we can use trial and error or solve the equation systematically. Let&#x27;s try different values for y and z and see if we can find any solutions.

If y = 1 and z = 1, the equation becomes:
