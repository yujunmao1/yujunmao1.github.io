<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients. If there are three different integers a, b, c, such that f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=-1, then at most how many integer-valued roots can this polynomial have?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let g(x)=f(x)+1, so a, b, c are the three roots of g(x).
2. Thus, g(x)=(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)h(x) for some polynomial h(x).
3. If there exists integer k such that f(k)=0, then g(k)=f(k)+1=1.
4. This means that (k-a)(k-b)(k-c)h(k)=1.
5. The first three terms are all distinct integers, but 1 can be the product of at most one distinct integers (1 itself).
6. Thus, we have a contradiction, and no such k exists.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a polynomial f(x) of degree n with integer coefficients, if both f(0) and f(1) are odd, at most how many integer-valued zeros can it have?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Let a be an integer zero of f(x).
2. Study the parity of f(0) and f(1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the polynomial&#x27;s values at specific points and the implications for its integer zeros.

Given that f(0) and f(1) are both odd, we can infer the following:

1. Since f(0) is odd, the constant term of the polynomial is odd. This is because when we evaluate a polynomial at x = 0, all terms involving x vanish, leaving only the constant term.

2. Since f(1) is odd, the sum of all the coefficients of the polynomial is odd. This is because when we evaluate a polynomial at x = 1, each term contributes its coefficient to the sum.

Now, let&#x27;s consider an integer zero of f(x), say a. Since a is an integer, f(a) = 0. We can write f(x) as:

f(x) = (x - a)g(x) + f(a)

where g(x) is another polynomial with integer coefficients (since the coefficients of f(x) are integers and a is an integer).

Now, let&#x27;s evaluate f(x) at x = a + 1:

f(a + 1) = ((a + 1) - a)g(a + 1) + f(a)
f(a + 1) = g(a + 1) + 0
f(a + 1) = g(a + 1)

Since g(x) has integer coefficients, g(a + 1) is an integer. Now, let&#x27;s consider two cases:

Case 1: a is even.
If a is even, then a + 1 is odd. Since f(1) is odd and f(a + 1) = g(a + 1) is an integer, g(a + 1) must be even because the sum of an odd number (f(1)) and an even number (g(a + 1)) is odd.

Case 2: a is odd.
If a is odd, then a + 1 is even. Since f(0) is odd and f(a + 1) = g(a + 1) is an integer, g(a + 1) must be odd because the sum of an odd number (f(0)) and an odd number (g(a + 1)) is even.

From these two cases, we can see that the parity of g(a + 1) depends on the parity of a. If a is even, g(a + 1) is even, and if a is odd, g(a + 1) is odd.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the possibility of having two integer zeros, a and b, where a &lt; b. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume a is even and b is odd (the argument will be similar if a is odd and b is even).

Since a is even, g(a + 1) is even. Since b is odd, g(b + 1) is odd. However, since g(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, the difference g(b + 1) - g(a + 1) must also be an integer. But this difference is odd - even = odd, which means that g(x) changes parity between a + 1 and b + 1.

This implies that there must be at least one integer m between a + 1 and b + 1 where g(m) = 0 (by the Intermediate Value Theorem for polynomials over the integers). However, if g(m) = 0 for some integer m, then f(m) = (m - a)g(m) + f(a) = 0, which means that m is another integer zero of f(x).

But we have already established that f(x) cannot have any integer zeros because f(0) and f(1) are both odd. Therefore, we have a contradiction, and our assumption that f(x) can have two integer zeros is incorrect.

Thus, the polynomial f(x) cannot have any integer zeros if both f(0) and f(1) are odd. The maximum number of integer-valued zeros that f(x) can have under these conditions is zero.</code></pre>
