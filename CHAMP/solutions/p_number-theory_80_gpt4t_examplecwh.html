<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A number is a multiple of 3 if and only if its digit sum is divisible by 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s take the number 351 as an example.

To apply the concept, we need to find the sum of the digits of 351:

3 + 5 + 1 = 9

Now we check if the digit sum (9) is divisible by 3:

9 ÷ 3 = 3

Since 9 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, the digit sum is indeed divisible by 3. According to the concept, this means that the original number (351) should also be a multiple of 3.

To verify this, we can divide 351 by 3:

351 ÷ 3 = 117

Since 351 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, we have confirmed that 351 is a multiple of 3, which is consistent with the concept that if the digit sum of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is a multiple of 3.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s consider the number 729 as an example.

To apply the concept, we first calculate the sum of the digits of 729:

7 + 2 + 9 = 18

Next, we check if the digit sum (18) is divisible by 9:

18 ÷ 9 = 2

Since 18 is divisible by 9 with no remainder, the digit sum is indeed divisible by 9. According to the concept, this means that the original number (729) should also be a multiple of 9.

To confirm this, we can divide 729 by 9:

729 ÷ 9 = 81

Since 729 is divisible by 9 with no remainder, we have confirmed that 729 is a multiple of 9, which is consistent with the concept that if the digit sum of a number is divisible by 9, then the number itself is a multiple of 9.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Can the digit sum of a perfect square be 1977?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the divisibility of the number by 3 and 9.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the digit sum of a perfect square can be 1977, we can use the fact that the digit sum of a perfect square must follow the same divisibility rules as any other number. Specifically, if a number&#x27;s digit sum is divisible by 9, then the number itself is divisible by 9.

Let&#x27;s first check if 1977 is divisible by 9:

1 + 9 + 7 + 7 = 24

The sum of the digits of 1977 is 24, which is not divisible by 9 (since 24 ÷ 9 = 2 with a remainder of 6). This means that 1977 itself is not divisible by 9.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the properties of perfect squares in relation to divisibility by 3 and 9:

- If a number is a perfect square, then its prime factorization will have all even exponents.
- If a number is divisible by 9, then its prime factorization includes at least two factors of 3 (since 9 = 3^2).
- If a perfect square is divisible by 9, then its digit sum must also be divisible by 9, because the digit sum retains the divisibility properties of the original number.

Since the digit sum of 1977 is not divisible by 9, it means that 1977 cannot be the digit sum of a perfect square that is divisible by 9. However, we need to consider perfect squares that are not divisible by 9.

For a perfect square that is not divisible by 9, its digit sum does not need to be divisible by 9. But, if we look at the digit sum of 1977, which is 24, we can see that it is divisible by 3 (since 24 ÷ 3 = 8). This means that if 1977 were the digit sum of a perfect square, that perfect square would have to be divisible by 3 (but not necessarily by 9).

However, if a perfect square is divisible by 3, it must also be divisible by 9, because the square of any number divisible by 3 will have a factor of 3 raised to an even power, which means it will have at least two factors of 3 and thus be divisible by 9.

Since 1977 is not divisible by 9, it cannot be the digit sum of a perfect square that is divisible by 3. Therefore, we can conclude that the digit sum of a perfect square cannot be 1977.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Now, summarize the answer above in one sentence, without any intermediate steps or explanations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The digit sum of a perfect square cannot be 1977 because this number is not divisible by 9, and the digit sum of any perfect square must be divisible by 9 if the square itself is divisible by 3, which is a necessary condition for a number whose digit sum is divisible by 3, as is the case with 1977.</code></pre>
