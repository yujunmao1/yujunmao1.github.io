<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?
Step-wise solution:
1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. For each of the n-1 gaps, we can choose to insert a divider or not, and we count the number of points in each group, which forms a sequence (a_1, ..., a_(m+1)) for m dividers that sum up to n.
3. Thus, the number of times that k appears among all the sequences is the number of times that a group of k points appear among all the divider configurations.
4. To get this number, we can find a k-point group and isolate it.
5. We need one divider if the group is at the two ends of the row, in which case we have n-k-1 remaining gaps to fill.
6. We need two dividers if the group is at the middle, where we have n-k-1 possible group locations, and for each location, we have n-k-2 remaining gaps to fill.
7. Thus, we have 2*2^(n-k-1)+(n-k-1)*2^(n-k-2)=(n-k+3)*2^(n-k-2) groups of k, which is also the number of times that k appear in sequences that sum up to n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let a_n be the number of all permutations p of {1, ..., n} with min(n-|p(i)−i|, |p(i)−i|)≤1 for all i. Find a_10.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the number of permutations \( p \) of the set \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \) such that for every element \( i \) in the permutation, the condition \( \min(n-|p(i)−i|, |p(i)−i|) \leq 1 \) is satisfied. This condition essentially means that each element \( i \) must be at a position \( p(i) \) such that it is either at its original position \( i \), one position away from \( i \), or at the position \( n-i+1 \) (which is the &#x27;wrap-around&#x27; case).

Let&#x27;s denote \( a_n \) as the number of such permutations for a set of size \( n \). We are asked to find \( a_{10} \).

To find \( a_{10} \), we can consider the possible positions for each element in the permutation. Since the condition must hold for all elements, we can build the permutation step by step.

1. The element 1 can either stay in position 1, move to position 2, or move to position 10 (the wrap-around case). That&#x27;s 3 options for element 1.
2. The element 2 can also have 3 options: stay in position 2, move to position 1 or 3, unless position 1 is already taken by element 1.
3. This pattern continues for each element, except for the last element, which will have fewer options if some of the wrap-around positions are already taken.

However, we can notice that the condition is quite restrictive. For example, if element 1 is in position 2, then element 2 cannot be in position 1 because it would violate the condition for element 2 (since \( |2-1| = 1 \) but \( n-|2-1| = 10-1 = 9 \), which is not less than or equal to 1).

This means that the elements are &quot;chained&quot; together. If one element moves, it forces the adjacent elements to move in a certain way to satisfy the condition. This chaining effect simplifies the problem because it reduces the number of valid permutations we need to consider.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible &quot;chains&quot; of movements:
- All elements stay in their original positions. This is just 1 permutation.
- One element moves to the next position, and this forces a chain reaction. For example, if 1 goes to position 2, then 2 must go to 3, and so on, until we reach the end of the chain. The last element in the chain can either wrap around to the first position or stay in the second-to-last position.

Given the restrictive nature of the condition and the chaining effect, we can deduce that the number of permutations is related to the number of ways we can create such chains. However, the problem is not trivial and requires a more systematic approach to count all valid permutations.

One way to approach this is to use dynamic programming to build up the count of valid permutations from smaller cases to larger ones. We can define a recursive relation that counts the number of valid permutations for a set of size \( n \) based on the counts for smaller sets.

Unfortunately, without a clear recursive formula or a more detailed analysis, we cannot directly compute \( a_{10} \) from the given information. This problem requires a more in-depth combinatorial argument or a dynamic programming approach to solve, which is beyond the scope of this explanation.

Therefore, to find \( a_{10} \), we would need to either derive a recursive formula that accurately counts the number of valid permutations for each \( n \) or write a computer program that enumerates all possible permutations and checks them against the given condition.</code></pre>
