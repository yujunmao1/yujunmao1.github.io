<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 4 is a simple arithmetic test to determine whether a given integer is divisible by 4. According to this rule, a number is divisible by 4 if the number formed by its last two digits (the tens and the units place) is divisible by 4.

Here&#x27;s how you can apply the rule:

1. Look at the last two digits of the number you want to test for divisibility by 4.
2. If the number formed by these two digits is divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4. If not, then the number is not divisible by 4.

For example, let&#x27;s test the number 1,236 for divisibility by 4:
- The last two digits are 36.
- Since 36 is divisible by 4 (as 4 × 9 = 36), the entire number 1,236 is also divisible by 4.

Another example is the number 1,578:
- The last two digits are 78.
- Since 78 is not divisible by 4 (as 4 × 19 = 76, which is close but not equal to 78), the number 1,578 is not divisible by 4.

This rule works because the number 100 (and any multiple of it, like 1000, 10000, etc.) is divisible by 4. Therefore, when you are looking at the last two digits, you are essentially ignoring the part of the number that is already known to be divisible by 4 and focusing on the remainder, which determines the divisibility of the entire number.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and concepts in modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference (a - b) is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
a ≡ b (mod n)

For example, 38 ≡ 14 (mod 12) because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Addition:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n).
For example, if 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 7 ≡ 1 (mod 3), then (5 + 7) ≡ (2 + 1) (mod 3), or 12 ≡ 3 (mod 3).

3. Subtraction:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n).
For example, if 8 ≡ 5 (mod 3) and 3 ≡ 0 (mod 3), then (8 - 3) ≡ (5 - 0) (mod 3), or 5 ≡ 5 (mod 3).

4. Multiplication:
If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n).
For example, if 4 ≡ 1 (mod 3) and 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3), then (4 * 5) ≡ (1 * 2) (mod 3), or 20 ≡ 2 (mod 3).

5. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. You can only divide by a number if it has a multiplicative inverse modulo n. An integer a has an inverse modulo n if there exists an integer b such that (a * b) ≡ 1 (mod n). If a ≡ b (mod n) and c has an inverse modulo n, then (a / c) ≡ (b / c) (mod n).

6. Powers:
If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k.
For example, if 2 ≡ 5 (mod 3), then 2^3 ≡ 5^3 (mod 3), or 8 ≡ 125 (mod 3).

7. Modular Reduction:
Any integer a can be reduced modulo n by finding the remainder r when a is divided by n (0 ≤ r &lt; n). The number r is said to be a modulo n.
For example, 17 modulo 5 is 2 because when you divide 17 by 5, the remainder is 2.

Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is particularly useful in situations where periodicity is inherent, such as in clock arithmetic where the hours &quot;wrap around&quot; after 12 or 24 hours.</code></pre>

Is 385^1980+18^1980 a perfect square?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine whether \( 385^{1980} + 18^{1980} \) is a perfect square, we can use modular arithmetic to analyze the expression modulo 4. The reason for choosing modulo 4 is that a perfect square always has a remainder of 0 or 1 when divided by 4. This is because:

- If a number is even (2k), its square is \( (2k)^2 = 4k^2 \), which is divisible by 4.
- If a number is odd (2k + 1), its square is \( (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 4(k^2 + k) + 1 \), which leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

Let&#x27;s examine each term modulo 4:

For \( 385^{1980} \):
- 385 is odd, and any odd number is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.
- 385 mod 4 = 1 (since 384 is divisible by 4 and 385 is one more than 384).
- Therefore, \( 385^{1980} \) mod 4 = \( 1^{1980} \) mod 4 = 1 mod 4 (since 1 raised to any power is still 1).

For \( 18^{1980} \):
- 18 is even, and any even number squared is divisible by 4.
- 18 mod 4 = 2.
- Therefore, \( 18^{1980} \) mod 4 = \( (18^2)^{990} \) mod 4 = \( (324)^{990} \) mod 4 = 0 mod 4 (since 324 is divisible by 4, and any power of it will also be divisible by 4).

Now, let&#x27;s add the two results modulo 4:
\( (385^{1980} + 18^{1980}) \) mod 4 = (1 mod 4 + 0 mod 4) = 1 mod 4.

Since \( 385^{1980} + 18^{1980} \) is congruent to 1 modulo 4, it has the same remainder as a perfect square when divided by 4. However, this is not sufficient to conclude that it is a perfect square, as there are non-square numbers that also leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.

To further analyze, we need to consider the expression modulo other bases or use additional properties of perfect squares. However, the problem becomes much more complex and may not be solvable with elementary methods. Advanced number theory or computational methods might be required to determine definitively whether \( 385^{1980} + 18^{1980} \) is a perfect square.

In summary, the analysis modulo 4 shows that \( 385^{1980} + 18^{1980} \) could potentially be a perfect square, but it does not guarantee it. Further investigation is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.</code></pre>
