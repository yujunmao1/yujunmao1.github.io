<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or by considering permutations with certain restrictions. Let&#x27;s follow the steps outlined in the problem to find the solution.

Step 1: Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By doing this, we eliminate the edge cases at the beginning and end of the street. Now, every parking lot has a lot before and after it.

Step 2: Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

For every driver to be able to park in the circular lot, there must be no sequence of n consecutive lots that are all occupied. This is because if there were, the last car to arrive would find all lots occupied and would not be able to park.

Step 3: Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

We need to count the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n+1 such that no n consecutive numbers are in their natural order (1, 2, 3, ..., n) because this would correspond to a situation where all lots are occupied when the last car arrives.

This is a classic problem in combinatorics, and the number of such permutations is given by the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) of n+1 elements, denoted by D(n+1), minus the permutations that have exactly one fixed point (since this would correspond to a sequence of n consecutive lots being occupied).

The number of derangements of n+1 elements is approximately (n+1)!/e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm, and the factorial (n+1)! is the number of all permutations of n+1 elements.

Step 4: For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Since we are considering sequences of length n with values in 1 to n+1, each sequence has n+1 cyclic shifts (including the sequence itself). However, only one of these shifts corresponds to a valid parking configuration on the original street (not the circular one), because the (n+1)-th lot does not exist on the street.

Therefore, for each valid sequence in the circular lot, there is exactly one corresponding sequence that leads to a valid parking configuration on the street.

The final answer is the number of valid sequences in the circular lot, which is D(n+1) - the permutations with exactly one fixed point, divided by n+1 to account for the cyclic shifts.

To calculate D(n+1), we use the formula:

D(n) = n! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^n/n!)

So, D(n+1) = (n+1)! * (1 - 1/1! + 1/2! - 1/3! + ... + (-1)^(n+1)/(n+1)!)

Now, we need to subtract the permutations with exactly one fixed point. There are n+1 choices for the fixed point, and the remaining n elements must form a derangement, so we have (n+1) * D(n).

Therefore, the number of valid sequences is:

D(n+1) - (n+1) * D(n)

And the final answer, accounting for the cyclic shifts, is:

(D(n+1) - (n+1) * D(n)) / (n+1)

This simplifies to:

D(n+1)/(n+1) - D(n)

This is the expression for the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park, as an expression of n. Calculating the exact number would require computing the derangements, which can be done using the recursive formula or direct computation for specific values of n.</code></pre>
