If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving counting books on a bookshelf.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with several rows of books, and you want to count the total number of books. However, instead of counting each book once, you decide to count each book three times (perhaps to triple-check your count).

After going through the counting process, you find that you have counted a total of n = 90 counts. Since you counted each book d = 3 times, you want to find out the actual number of books on the shelf.

According to the concept, to find the actual number of books, you would divide the total number of counts by the number of times you counted each book:

Number of books = n / d
                = 90 / 3
                = 30

So, there are 30 books on the bookshelf.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. A rotation of the table preserves the neighboring relationship.
2. A reflection (mirroring) of the table through the center preserves the neighboring relationship.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to account for the fact that in a circular arrangement, rotations and reflections do not change the neighboring relationships between people.

First, let&#x27;s consider the number of ways to arrange n people in a line, which is n!. However, when these people are arranged in a circle, we need to consider that any rotation of the circle doesn&#x27;t change the arrangement in terms of neighboring relationships.

For a circular table with n people, we can fix one person in place (to prevent counting rotations as different arrangements) and then arrange the remaining (n - 1) people around them. This gives us (n - 1)! distinct arrangements since the first person is fixed and does not contribute to the permutations of the remaining seats.

Now, we must also consider reflections. A reflection across a line through the center of the table will preserve the neighboring relationships but will provide a different sequence if we were to list the people&#x27;s names. However, since this reflection does not change the neighboring relationships, we should not count reflected arrangements as distinct.

Each circular arrangement has exactly one reflection that preserves the neighboring relationships. Therefore, we need to divide the number of arrangements by 2 to account for reflections.

So, the total number of distinct arrangements around a circular table, accounting for rotations and reflections, is given by:

Distinct arrangements = (n - 1)! / 2

This is the expression for the number of distinct arrangements of n people around a circular table.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of distinct arrangements of n people sitting around a circular table, accounting for rotations and reflections, is (n - 1)! / 2.</code></pre>
