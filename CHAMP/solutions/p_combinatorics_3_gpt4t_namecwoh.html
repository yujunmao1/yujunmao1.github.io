<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to place \( n \) rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks threaten each other (i.e., no two rooks are in the same row or column), and the placement is invariant under a 180-degree rotation.

First, let&#x27;s consider the case of an \( n \times n \) chessboard where \( n \) is odd. When \( n \) is odd, there is a central square on the chessboard. Since the placement must be invariant under a 180-degree rotation, the rook placed on the central square will occupy the same square after rotation. Therefore, there is only one way to place a rook on the central square.

For the remaining \( n-1 \) rooks, we need to place them such that they are in a peaceful configuration and their placement is symmetric with respect to the center of the board. Since the board is symmetric, we only need to decide the placement for \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) rooks, and the other \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) will be determined by the 180-degree rotational symmetry.

Each of the \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) rooks can be placed in \( n - 1 \) ways (since one row and one column are already occupied by the central rook and its symmetric counterpart). However, once we place one rook, the number of available squares for the next rook decreases by 2 (one for the row and one for the column of the placed rook and its symmetric counterpart). Therefore, the number of ways to place the \( \frac{n-1}{2} \) rooks is:

\[ (n-1) \times (n-3) \times (n-5) \times \cdots \times 2 \times 1 \]

This is the product of all odd numbers from 1 to \( n-1 \), which is essentially the double factorial of \( n-2 \) (denoted as \( (n-2)!! \)).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case of an \( n \times n \) chessboard where \( n \) is even. There is no central square, so we need to place \( \frac{n}{2} \) rooks and their symmetric counterparts. The first rook can be placed in \( n \) ways, the second in \( n-2 \) ways, and so on, until the \( \frac{n}{2} \)th rook, which can be placed in \( n - (\frac{n}{2} - 1) \times 2 = 2 \) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to place the \( \frac{n}{2} \) rooks is:

\[ n \times (n-2) \times (n-4) \times \cdots \times 4 \times 2 \]

This is the product of all even numbers from 2 to \( n \), which is \( n \) times the double factorial of \( n-2 \) (denoted as \( n \times (n-2)!! \)).

In summary, the number of ways to place \( n \) rooks peacefully on an \( n \times n \) chessboard that is invariant under a 180-degree rotation is:

- For odd \( n \): \( (n-2)!! \)
- For even \( n \): \( n \times (n-2)!! \)

This gives us the final answer for both cases.</code></pre>
