<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

a_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^n)

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is positive, so adding another term to the sum will always make the sum larger. In other words, for all n in the natural numbers, a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

The sequence is also bounded above. Specifically, it is bounded by the sum of the infinite series:

S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...

This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1 is given by the formula S = a / (1 - r). In this case, the sum is:

S = 1 / (1 - 1/2) = 1 / (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the sequence (a_n) is bounded above by 2.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 2. So, we can say that:

lim (n -&gt; âˆž) a_n = 2

This means that as n becomes very large, the value of a_n gets arbitrarily close to 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence is defined by a_1=sqrt(2), a_(n+1)=sqrt(2)^a_n. Does the limit for the sequence exist, and if so, find it.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the monotonicity and boundedness of the sequence.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the sequence defined by \( a_1 = \sqrt{2} \) and \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n} \) has a limit, we need to investigate its monotonicity and boundedness.

First, let&#x27;s look at the first few terms of the sequence to get an idea of its behavior:

\( a_1 = \sqrt{2} \)
\( a_2 = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \) (which is greater than \( \sqrt{2} \) since \( \sqrt{2} &gt; 1 \))
\( a_3 = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}} \) (which is greater than \( a_2 \) for the same reason)

It seems that the sequence is increasing. To prove that the sequence is monotonically increasing, we assume that \( a_n &gt; \sqrt{2} \) and show that \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \):

Assuming \( a_n &gt; \sqrt{2} \), since the function \( f(x) = \sqrt{2}^x \) is increasing for \( x &gt; 0 \), we have \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n} &gt; \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} = a_2 &gt; a_1 = \sqrt{2} \). Therefore, by induction, if \( a_n &gt; \sqrt{2} \), then \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \), and the sequence is monotonically increasing.

Next, we need to show that the sequence is bounded above. Let&#x27;s assume that the sequence has a limit \( L \). Then, by the definition of the sequence, we have:

\( L = \lim_{n \to \infty} a_{n+1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt{2}^{a_n} \)

Since the limit of the sequence as \( n \) approaches infinity is the same as the limit of the sequence shifted by one index, we can write:

\( L = \sqrt{2}^L \)

Taking the logarithm of both sides (with base \( \sqrt{2} \)) gives us:

\( \log_{\sqrt{2}}(L) = L \)

Since \( \log_{\sqrt{2}}(L) \) is the power to which \( \sqrt{2} \) must be raised to get \( L \), we have:

\( \sqrt{2}^{\log_{\sqrt{2}}(L)} = \sqrt{2}^L \)

This simplifies to:

\( L = \sqrt{2}^L \)

The only solution to this equation is \( L = 2 \), because:

\( 2 = \sqrt{2}^2 \)

So, if the sequence has a limit, the limit must be 2. However, we have not yet shown that the sequence is bounded above by 2. To do this, we need to prove that for all \( n \), \( a_n \leq 2 \).

We can prove this by induction. We have already established that \( a_1 = \sqrt{2} &lt; 2 \). Now, assume that \( a_n \leq 2 \) for some \( n \). Then:

\( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{2}^{a_n} \)

Since \( a_n \leq 2 \) and \( \sqrt{2} &lt; 2 \), raising \( \sqrt{2} \) to a power less than or equal to 2 will result in a number less than or equal to 2. Therefore, \( a_{n+1} \leq 2 \).

By induction, the sequence is bounded above by 2.

Since we have shown that the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it follows from the Monotone Convergence Theorem that the sequence has a limit. We have also shown that if the sequence has a limit, that limit must be 2. Therefore, the limit of the sequence exists and is equal to 2:

\( \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 2 \)</code></pre>
