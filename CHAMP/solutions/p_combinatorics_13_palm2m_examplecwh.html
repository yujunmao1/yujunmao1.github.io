<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a deck of 52 cards. You want to choose a hand of 5 cards. The number of ways to do this is $C(52, 5) = 2,598,960$.

Another example is if you have a group of 10 people and you want to choose a committee of 3 people. The number of ways to do this is $C(10, 3) = 120$.

In general, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is given by the formula $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$, where $n!$ is the factorial of $n$ and $k!$ is the factorial of $k$.

The factorial of a number is the product of all the positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, $5! = 120$ because $120 = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$.

The formula for $C(n, k)$ can be derived using the following argument. Let&#x27;s say we want to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items. We can do this by first choosing the first item, then the second item, and so on until we have chosen $k$ items. There are $n$ choices for the first item, $n-1$ choices for the second item, and so on. So, the total number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $n(n-1)(n-2)\dots(n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$.

However, this overcounts the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items, because it doesn&#x27;t take into account the order in which we choose the items. For example, the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ is the same set as the set $\\{3, 2, 1\\}$. So, we need to divide the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items by the number of ways to order $k$ items. The number of ways to order $k$ items is $k!$. So, the number of ways to choose a set of $k$ items from a set of $n$ items is $C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Find the number of ways to choose a collection containing k distinguishable objects.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to choose $n$ objects from $3n+1$ objects, where $n$ of the objects are indistinguishable and the remaining ones are distinct, is given by the following formula:

$$\binom{3n+1}{n} = \frac{(3n+1)!}{n!(3n-n)!} = \frac{(3n+1)!}{n!2^n}$$

To see why this is the case, let&#x27;s consider the following example. Suppose we have 5 objects, 3 of which are indistinguishable and 2 of which are distinct. We can choose 3 objects in $\binom{5}{3} = 10$ ways. However, some of these ways will be equivalent, since we don&#x27;t care about the order in which we choose the indistinguishable objects. For example, the choices $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\{3, 2, 1\\}$ are both equivalent, since the indistinguishable objects can be swapped without changing the set.

To account for this, we need to divide the number of ways to choose 3 objects without caring about the order by the number of ways to order 3 indistinguishable objects. This is $3!$, since there are 3! ways to order 3 objects. So, the number of ways to choose 3 objects from 5 objects, where 3 of the objects are indistinguishable, is given by:

$$\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = 10$$

In general, the number of ways to choose $n$ objects from $3n+1$ objects, where $n$ of the objects are indistinguishable, is given by the following formula:

$$\binom{3n+1}{n} = \frac{(3n+1)!}{n!(3n-n)!} = \frac{(3n+1)!}{n!2^n}$$</code></pre>
