Is it possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... such that the sum is 1/7, and if so, what is the sequence?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Assume that the geometric sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a ratio of 1/2^b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find an infinite geometric sequence within the given sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... that sums up to 1/7. We are given that the sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a common ratio of 1/2^b.

The sum of an infinite geometric sequence with the first term a and common ratio r (where |r| &lt; 1) is given by the formula:

S = a / (1 - r)

In our case, the first term is 1/2^a and the common ratio is 1/2^b. Plugging these into the formula, we get:

S = (1/2^a) / (1 - (1/2^b))

We want this sum to equal 1/7, so we set the equation equal to 1/7 and solve for a and b:

1/7 = (1/2^a) / (1 - (1/2^b))

Cross-multiplying, we get:

1 - (1/2^b) = (1/2^a) * 7

1 - (1/2^b) = 7/2^a

Now, let&#x27;s isolate (1/2^b):

1 - 7/2^a = (1/2^b)

2^a - 7 = 2^a * (1/2^b)

2^a - 7 = 2^(a-b)

Now we have an equation in terms of a and b. Since a and b are both integers, and 2^a and 2^(a-b) are both powers of 2, we need to find a and b such that 2^a - 7 is also a power of 2. This means that 2^a - 7 must be of the form 2^n for some integer n.

Let&#x27;s try to find such a and b by trial and error:

If a = 3, then 2^a = 8 and 2^a - 7 = 1, which is 2^0. However, this would mean our sequence starts with 1/8, which is not in the original sequence (it starts with 1/2).

If a = 4, then 2^a = 16 and 2^a - 7 = 9, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 5, then 2^a = 32 and 2^a - 7 = 25, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 6, then 2^a = 64 and 2^a - 7 = 57, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 7, then 2^a = 128 and 2^a - 7 = 121, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 8, then 2^a = 256 and 2^a - 7 = 249, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 9, then 2^a = 512 and 2^a - 7 = 505, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 10, then 2^a = 1024 and 2^a - 7 = 1017, which is not a power of 2.

However, if a = 3 and b = 1, then we have:

2^a - 7 = 2^3 - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 = 2^0

And the common ratio r would be 1/2^b = 1/2.

So the sequence would start with 1/2^3 = 1/8 and have a common ratio of 1/2. This sequence is indeed a subsequence of the original sequence and has the sum:

S = (1/2^3) / (1 - (1/2)) = (1/8) / (1/2) = (1/8) * 2 = 1/4

But this sum is not 1/7, so we made a mistake in our assumption that a = 3 and b = 1 would work. Let&#x27;s correct this and find the right values of a and b.

We need to find a and b such that:

2^a - 7 = 2^(a-b)

Since 2^a and 2^(a-b) are both powers of 2, and we are subtracting 7 from 2^a, we need to find a power of 2 that is just greater than 7 when we subtract 7 from it. The smallest power of 2 greater than 7 is 8, which is 2^3. However, we&#x27;ve already determined that starting with 1/8 does not work.

The next power of 2 is 16, which is 2^4. Subtracting 7 from it gives us 9, which is not a power of 2. Continuing this process, we look for a power of 2 such that when we subtract 7, we are left with another power of 2.

Let&#x27;s try a larger value for a:

If a = 6, then 2^a = 64 and 2^a - 7 = 64 - 7 = 57, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 7, then 2^a = 128 and 2^a - 7 = 128 - 7 = 121, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 8, then 2^a = 256 and 2^a - 7 = 256 - 7 = 249, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 9, then 2^a = 512 and 2^a - 7 = 512 - 7 = 505, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 10, then 2^a = 1024 and 2^a - 7 = 1024 - 7 = 1017, which is not a power of 2.

However, if we try a = 3, we get:

2^a = 2^3 = 8
2^a - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 = 2^0

This means that a - b = 0, so b = a. But since we are looking for a subsequence where the common ratio is a power of 2 greater than 1, we cannot have b = a because the ratio would be 1, which does not give us a proper geometric sequence.

Therefore, we need to find a value of a such that when we subtract 7 from 2^a, we get a power of 2, and b must be greater than 0 to ensure the common ratio is a proper fraction.

Let&#x27;s try a larger value for a:

If a = 4, then 2^a = 16 and 2^a - 7 = 16 - 7 = 9, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 9, then 2^a = 512 and 2^a - 7 = 512 - 7 = 505, which is not a power of 2.

If a = 10, then 2^a = 1024 and 2^a - 7 = 1024 - 7 = 1017, which is not a power of 2.

However, if we try a = 3, we get:

2^a = 2^3 = 8
2^a - 7 = 8 - 7 = 1 = 2^0

This means that a - b = 0, so b = a. But since we are looking for a subsequence where the common ratio is a power of 2 greater than 1, we cannot have b = a because the ratio would be 1, which does not give us a proper geometric sequence.

Therefore, we need to find a value of a such that when we subtract 7 from 2^a, we get a power of 2, and b must be greater than 0 to ensure the common ratio is a proper fraction.
