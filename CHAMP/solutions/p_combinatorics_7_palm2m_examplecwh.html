<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a(n) be the number of possible rearrangements (including the original one) for n seats, and consider the movement of the first child in the row.
2. If the first child does not move, how many rearrangements do we have?
3. If the first child moves, how many rearrangements do we have?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $a(n)$ be the number of possible rearrangements (including the original one) for $n$ seats, and consider the movement of the first child in the row.

If the first child does not move, then the remaining $10$ children can be rearranged in $10!$ ways.

If the first child moves, then the remaining $10$ children can be rearranged in $10!$ ways, and the first child can move to any of the $11$ seats. So, there are $11 \times 10!$ ways for the first child to move.

Therefore, the total number of possible rearrangements is $a(11) = 10! + 11 \times 10! = 2 \times 10! = 3628800$.

Here is a more detailed solution:

We can solve this problem by considering the movement of the first child in the row. If the first child does not move, then the remaining $10$ children can be rearranged in $10!$ ways. This is because there are $10$ choices for the first child to sit in, $9$ choices for the second child to sit in, and so on. So, there are $10! = 3628800$ ways for the remaining $10$ children to be rearranged.

If the first child moves, then the remaining $10$ children can be rearranged in $10!$ ways, and the first child can move to any of the $11$ seats. So, there are $11 \times 10!$ ways for the first child to move. This is because there are $11$ choices for the first child to move to, and then the remaining $10$ children can be rearranged in $10!$ ways.

Therefore, the total number of possible rearrangements is $a(11) = 10! + 11 \times 10! = 2 \times 10! = 3628800$.</code></pre>
