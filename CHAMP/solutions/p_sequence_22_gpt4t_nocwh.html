<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A sequence {x_n} is defined by x_1=2, x_(n+1)=(x_n^4+9)/(10x_n). For how many values of x_1, x_2, ..., x_1000 do we have x_n≤5/4?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study the condition of x_(n+1)≤x_n.
2. When the condition is not met, find a lower bound for all x_n by writing (x_n^4+9)/(10x_n) as a sum of four fractions so that their multiplication does not contain x_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence defined by the recursive formula x_(n+1) = (x_n^4 + 9) / (10x_n). We want to find out for how many terms x_n ≤ 5/4.

First, let&#x27;s study the condition x_(n+1) ≤ x_n:

x_(n+1) ≤ x_n
(x_n^4 + 9) / (10x_n) ≤ x_n
x_n^4 + 9 ≤ 10x_n^2
x_n^4 - 10x_n^2 + 9 ≤ 0
(x_n^2 - 1)(x_n^2 - 9) ≤ 0

The roots of the quadratic factors are x_n = 1 and x_n = 3. Since x_n^2 - 9 has a positive leading coefficient, the inequality (x_n^2 - 1)(x_n^2 - 9) ≤ 0 holds between the roots of the factors. Therefore, the inequality is satisfied for 1 ≤ x_n ≤ 3.

Now, let&#x27;s find a lower bound for all x_n when the condition is not met. We can write (x_n^4 + 9) / (10x_n) as a sum of fractions:

(x_n^4 + 9) / (10x_n) = x_n^3 / 10 + 9 / (10x_n)

We want to find a lower bound for this expression that does not contain x_n. To do this, we can use the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), which states that for any non-negative real numbers a and b, the following holds:

AM = (a + b) / 2 ≥ √(ab) = GM

We apply this to the terms x_n^3 / 10 and 9 / (10x_n):

(x_n^3 / 10 + 9 / (10x_n)) / 2 ≥ √(x_n^3 / 10 * 9 / (10x_n))
(x_n^3 / 10 + 9 / (10x_n)) / 2 ≥ √(9x_n^2 / 100)
(x_n^3 / 10 + 9 / (10x_n)) / 2 ≥ 3x_n / 10

Since we are looking for a lower bound, we can ignore the division by 2, which gives us:

x_n^3 / 10 + 9 / (10x_n) ≥ 3x_n / 10

Now, we want to find the minimum value of the right side of the inequality. The minimum value of 3x_n / 10, given that x_n &gt; 3 (since we are considering the case when the condition x_(n+1) ≤ x_n is not met), is when x_n = 3:

3(3) / 10 = 9 / 10

So, we have a lower bound for x_(n+1) when x_n &gt; 3:

x_(n+1) ≥ 9 / 10

This means that once x_n exceeds 3, the sequence will never go below 9/10, and thus it will never go below 5/4 either.

Given that x_1 = 2, which is less than 5/4, we need to check the sequence to see when it first exceeds 5/4 and if it ever goes back down below 5/4.

Let&#x27;s calculate the first few terms:

x_1 = 2
x_2 = (2^4 + 9) / (10*2) = (16 + 9) / 20 = 25 / 20 = 5 / 4
x_3 = ((5/4)^4 + 9) / (10*(5/4)) = (625/256 + 9) / (50/4) = (625/256 + 2304/256) / (50/4) = 2929/256 * 4/50 = 2929/3200

Since 2929/3200 is less than 5/4, x_3 is less than 5/4. However, we have already established that once the sequence exceeds 3, it will never go below 9/10, and thus it will never go below 5/4 again. Therefore, we need to find when the sequence first exceeds 3.

Let&#x27;s assume that at some point x_k &gt; 3 for the first time. Then, for all n ≥ k, x_n will be greater than 3, and thus greater than 5/4. We need to find the smallest k such that x_k &gt; 3.

Since we don&#x27;t have a direct formula for x_n, we would need to iterate the sequence until we find the first term that exceeds 3. However, we can make some observations:

1. The sequence is increasing as long as x_n ≤ 3.
2. Once x_n &gt; 3, the sequence will remain above 9/10 and thus above 5/4.

Therefore, we only need to iterate until we find the first term that exceeds 3. After that, all subsequent terms will be above 5/4.

Let&#x27;s iterate a few more terms to see the behavior:

x_4 = ((2929/3200)^4 + 9) / (10*(2929/3200))
x_5 = ...
...
x_k &gt; 3

Once we find x_k &gt; 3, we know that for all n ≥ k, x_n &gt; 5/4. Since we are interested in the first 1000 terms, we would count all terms from x_k to x_1000 as being greater than 5/4.

Without a computer or calculator, it&#x27;s impractical to iterate this sequence manually 1000 times. However, we can conclude that the number of terms x_n ≤ 5/4 will be k - 1, where k is the first term such that x_k &gt; 3. All terms from x_k to x_1000 will be greater than 5/4.

To find the exact number of terms that are less than or equal to 5/4, we would need to use computational tools to iterate the sequence until we find the first term that exceeds 3. Once we have that term, we can give the exact count.</code></pre>
