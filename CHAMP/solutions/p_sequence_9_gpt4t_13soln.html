<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let x_j∈{0, 1} represent the initial state of lamp L_j (0 for OFF, 1 for ON) for 0≤j≤n-1.
2. We append to this sequence the new state of the lamp after each step.
3. So for example, x_n is the new state of lamp L_0 after the first step S_0.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to understand the effect of the sequence of steps on the state of the lamps. Let&#x27;s analyze the process step by step.

Initially, all lamps are ON, so we have \( x_j = 1 \) for all \( 0 \leq j \leq n-1 \).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the effect of step \( S_j \) on lamp \( L_j \):

- If \( L_{j-1} \) is ON (i.e., \( x_{j-1} = 1 \)), then \( S_j \) changes the state of \( L_j \).
- If \( L_{j-1} \) is OFF (i.e., \( x_{j-1} = 0 \)), then \( S_j \) leaves the state of \( L_j \) unchanged.

Since we are considering the lamps in a circle, the indices are taken modulo \( n \). This means that after step \( S_{n-1} \), the next step \( S_n \) will affect \( L_0 \) based on the state of \( L_{n-1} \).

Let&#x27;s denote the state of lamp \( L_j \) after step \( S_i \) as \( x_{i,j} \). Initially, \( x_{0,j} = 1 \) for all \( j \). After step \( S_0 \), the state of \( L_0 \) will change, so \( x_{1,0} = 0 \) and \( x_{1,j} = 1 \) for \( j \neq 0 \).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the general step \( S_j \). The state of \( L_j \) after step \( S_j \) will be:

\[ x_{j+1,j} = x_{j,j-1} \oplus x_{j,j} \]

where \( \oplus \) denotes the XOR operation (since changing the state is equivalent to XORing the current state with 1).

We want to find out for which values of \( n \) the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again. This means that we are looking for a situation where the sequence of states becomes periodic without reaching the initial state of all 1s.

Let&#x27;s consider the effect of the first full cycle of \( n \) steps. After \( n \) steps, the state of \( L_0 \) will have been affected \( n \) times, and since it changes state every time \( L_{n-1} \) is ON, it will have changed state an odd number of times (since all lamps were initially ON). Therefore, \( L_0 \) will be OFF after \( n \) steps.

For the sequence of switching to be unable to return all lamps to the ON state, there must be some lamps that are OFF after the first cycle. Since \( L_0 \) is OFF after \( n \) steps, and each subsequent lamp \( L_j \) changes state if the previous lamp \( L_{j-1} \) is ON, we can see that the pattern of ON/OFF states will propagate around the circle.

The key observation is that if \( n \) is even, after \( n \) steps, all lamps will be in the opposite state to their initial state (since each lamp will have changed state an odd number of times). This means that after \( 2n \) steps, all lamps will be back to the ON state.

However, if \( n \) is odd, the pattern of changes will not align in such a way that all lamps return to the ON state at the same time. Instead, there will be a &quot;wave&quot; of changes that moves around the circle indefinitely, and the lamps will never all be ON simultaneously again.

Therefore, for all odd \( n \), the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again. For even \( n \), it is always possible to return to the initial state.

Since we are considering \( n \) in the set \( \{2, 3, ..., 100\} \), we need to count the number of odd integers in this set. There are \( 50 \) even numbers (2, 4, ..., 100) and \( 49 \) odd numbers (3, 5, ..., 99) in this range.

Thus, the answer is \( 49 \), since there are 49 values of \( n \) for which the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again.</code></pre>
