<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 3 is a simple arithmetic test to determine whether a given integer is divisible by 3. According to this rule, an integer is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Here&#x27;s how you can apply the rule:

1. Take any integer and add up all of its digits.
2. Look at the sum you&#x27;ve obtained. If this sum is divisible by 3 (i.e., if it is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, etc.), then the original integer is also divisible by 3.
3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, then the original integer is not divisible by 3.

For example, let&#x27;s determine whether the number 12345 is divisible by 3:

1. Add the digits of the number: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
2. Determine if the sum is divisible by 3: Since 15 is divisible by 3 (15 รท 3 = 5), the original number, 12345, is also divisible by 3.

This rule is based on the fact that 3 is a factor of 9, and any number that is a multiple of 9 has a digit sum that is also a multiple of 9. Since 3 is a factor of 9, any number with a digit sum that is a multiple of 9 is also a multiple of 3. This property can be extended to any digit sum that is a multiple of 3, not just 9.

The divisibility rule for 3 is particularly useful because it allows you to quickly determine divisibility without having to perform long division. It&#x27;s a handy mental math trick that can be used in various mathematical problems and applications.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Fermat&#x27;s little theorem.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, named after the 17th-century French mathematician Pierre de Fermat. It provides an important property of numbers when dealing with modular arithmetic, particularly in the context of prime numbers.

The theorem states that if \( p \) is a prime number, then for any integer \( a \) that is not divisible by \( p \), the following congruence relation holds:

\[ a^{(p-1)} \equiv 1 \mod p \]

In other words, if you raise \( a \) to the power of \( p-1 \) and then divide by \( p \), the remainder is 1.

An equivalent way of stating Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is that \( a^p \equiv a \mod p \) for any integer \( a \), whether or not it is divisible by \( p \). This form is sometimes more convenient, depending on the context.

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the theorem:

Let&#x27;s take \( p = 7 \) (which is a prime number) and \( a = 3 \). According to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, \( 3^{(7-1)} \) or \( 3^6 \) should be congruent to 1 modulo 7. Indeed, \( 3^6 = 729 \), and when you divide 729 by 7, the remainder is 1.

Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is widely used in the field of cryptography, particularly in algorithms like RSA, where the computation of large powers modulo a prime is a common operation. It is also used in primality testing and in the construction of hash functions.

A special case of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is when \( a = 2 \). It states that \( 2^{(p-1)} \) will be congruent to 1 modulo \( p \) if \( p \) is prime. This special case is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fermat-Euler Two Squares Theorem&quot; or simply the &quot;Two Squares Theorem.&quot;

It&#x27;s important to note that the converse of Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem is not generally true; that is, if \( a^{(p-1)} \equiv 1 \mod p \) for some \( a \) and \( p \), it does not necessarily mean that \( p \) is prime. Numbers that satisfy this condition but are not prime are known as Carmichael numbers.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?
2. Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?
3. Starting with a prime p, would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?
4. If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s analyze the given information and questions step by step:

1. Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?
Appending the digit 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 to any number will immediately produce an even number (if the original number was even) or a number ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, which are all composite because they are divisible by 2 or 5 (except when the original number is a single digit less than 10, but for the purpose of this sequence, we can ignore single-digit cases).

2. Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?
To determine if a number is a multiple of 3, we can use the divisibility rule for 3, which states that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Therefore, if the current number in the sequence has a digit sum that is 1 or 2 less than a multiple of 3, appending the digit 1 or 2, respectively, will produce a multiple of 3.

3. Starting with a prime p, would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?
Appending the digit 3 repeatedly to any number will increase the digit sum by 3 each time. Since the digit sum increases by a multiple of 3, the resulting number will eventually become a multiple of 3 (and thus composite) unless the original number was already a multiple of 3. However, since we are starting with a prime \( p \), and primes greater than 3 are not multiples of 3, appending 3 will eventually lead to a composite number.

4. If \( a \mid bc \) and \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), then \( a \mid c \).
This is a property of divisibility that states if \( a \) divides the product of \( b \) and \( c \), and \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), then \( a \) must divide \( c \).

Now, let&#x27;s answer the main question: Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Given the information above, we can see that appending certain digits to a number will inevitably produce a composite number. Specifically, appending 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 will produce an even number or a number ending in 5, both of which are composite. Additionally, appending 1 or 2 when the digit sum is appropriately positioned will produce a multiple of 3.

Since we can always append a digit to make the number composite, and there are infinitely many digits to which we can append these digits, it follows that there can be infinitely many composite numbers in the sequence. There is no way to form a sequence that contains only finitely many composite numbers by appending one digit from 0 to 8 to the previous number, as we can always find a digit to append that results in a composite number.

Therefore, the answer to the question is no, there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence; there will always be infinitely many composite numbers.</code></pre>
