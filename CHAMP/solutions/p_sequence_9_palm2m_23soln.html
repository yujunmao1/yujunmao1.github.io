<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let x_j∈{0, 1} represent the initial state of lamp L_j (0 for OFF, 1 for ON) for 0≤j≤n-1.
2. We append to this sequence the new state of the lamp after each step.
3. So for example, x_n is the new state of lamp L_0 after the first step S_0.
4. We see that S_j computes x_j from x_(j-n) and x_(j-1): x_j=(x_(j-n)+x_(j-1)) mod 2.
5. Thus, every consecutive n numbers in the sequence corresponds to a state of the lamp, and the initial state is x_0, x_1, ..., x_(n-1).
6. Let the binary vector v_j=[x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)] and there are 2^n possible vectors.
7. Thus, some vector values have to repeat.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $n$ be an integer greater than 1. There are $n$ lamps $L_0, \ldots, L_{n-1}$ arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps $S_0, \ldots, S_i, \ldots$ is carried out. Step $S_j$ affects the state of $L_j$ only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if $L_{j-1}$ is ON, $S_j$ changes the state of $L_j$ from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if $L_{j-1}$ is OFF, $S_j$ leaves the state $L_j$ unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo $n$, that is, $L_{-1} = L_{n-1}$, $L_0 = L_n$, $L_1 = L_{n+1}$. Initially all lamps are ON. For $n \in \\{2, 3, \ldots, 100\\}$, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let $x_j \in \\{0, 1\\}$ represent the initial state of lamp $L_j$ (0 for OFF, 1 for ON) for $0 \leq j \leq n-1$.
2. We append to this sequence the new state of the lamp after each step.
3. So for example, $x_n$ is the new state of lamp $L_0$ after the first step $S_0$.
4. We see that $S_j$ computes $x_j$ from $x_{j-n}$ and $x_{j-1}$: $x_j = (x_{j-n} + x_{j-1}) \bmod 2$.
5. Thus, every consecutive $n$ numbers in the sequence corresponds to a state of the lamp, and the initial state is $x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_{n-1}$.
6. Let the binary vector $v_j = [x_j, x_{j+1}, \ldots, x_{j+n-1}]$ and there are $2^n$ possible vectors.
7. Thus, some vector values have to repeat.

We can use this to solve the problem as follows. For each $n$, we compute the number of distinct binary vectors of length $n$. This is equal to $2^n - 1$, since there is one vector that is all zeros. We then compute the number of binary vectors of length $n$ that appear in the sequence of states of the lamps. This is equal to the number of steps $i$ such that $v_i = v_j$ for some $j &lt; i$. We can compute this by keeping track of the set of all vectors that have appeared so far. When we reach a step $i$ such that $v_i$ is in this set, we increment the counter.

The number of steps $i$ such that $v_i = v_j$ for some $j &lt; i$ is equal to the number of times the sequence of states of the lamps repeats. If this number is greater than $n$, then the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again. Therefore, the answer to the problem is the number of $n$ such that the number of distinct binary vectors of length $n$ is less than the number of binary vectors of length $n$ that appear in the sequence of states of the lamps.

Here is a Python implementation of this algorithm:

```python
def solve(n):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Returns the number of $n$ such that the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    num_distinct_vectors = 2**n - 1
    num_vectors_in_sequence = 0
    vector_set = set()
    for i in range(n):
        v = [x_j for j in range(i, i+n)]
        if v in vector_set:
            num_vectors_in_sequence += 1
        else:
            vector_set.add(v)
    return num_distinct_vectors &lt; num_vectors_in_sequence

print(solve(2))
print(solve(3))
print(solve(4))
print(solve(5))
