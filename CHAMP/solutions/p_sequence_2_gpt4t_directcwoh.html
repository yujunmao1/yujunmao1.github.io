<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?

You may find the following information useful:

1. For positive x, x+1/x≥2, with equality if and only if x=1.
2. (x±y)^2=x^2±2xy+y^2.
3. For real numbers a_1, ..., a_n and b_1, ..., b_n, (a_1*b_1+...+a_n*b_n)^2≤(a_1^2+...+a_n^2)(b_1^2+...+b_n^2).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given information to analyze the behavior of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n}.

First, let&#x27;s use the inequality given in point 1:

For positive x, x + 1/x ≥ 2, with equality if and only if x = 1.

This inequality tells us that for any positive term in the sequences, the next term will be at least 2 because each term is defined as the sum of the previous term from another sequence and the reciprocal of a term from a third sequence.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the recursive definitions of the sequences:

x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n

Since x_1, y_1, and z_1 are positive, all subsequent terms will also be positive because the sum of positive numbers is positive.

Let&#x27;s analyze the behavior of the sequences for a few steps to see if we can find a pattern or a way to prove whether w_200 is always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20.

For n = 1, we have:

x_2 = y_1 + 1/z_1
y_2 = z_1 + 1/x_1
z_2 = x_1 + 1/y_1

Using the inequality x + 1/x ≥ 2, we can say:

x_2 ≥ 2
y_2 ≥ 2
z_2 ≥ 2

Now, let&#x27;s consider the next step:

x_3 = y_2 + 1/z_2
y_3 = z_2 + 1/x_2
z_3 = x_2 + 1/y_2

Again, using the inequality, we have:

x_3 ≥ y_2 + 1/2 ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5
y_3 ≥ z_2 + 1/2 ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5
z_3 ≥ x_2 + 1/2 ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5

We can see that the terms are increasing. However, to determine the behavior of w_200, we need to find a more general approach.

Let&#x27;s assume that at some step k, all terms are at least 2. Then:

x_(k+1) = y_k + 1/z_k ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5
y_(k+1) = z_k + 1/x_k ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5
z_(k+1) = x_k + 1/y_k ≥ 2 + 1/2 = 2.5

This shows that if all terms are at least 2 at some step, they will be at least 2.5 at the next step. By induction, we can see that the terms are monotonically increasing.

However, this does not yet tell us whether w_200 is always greater than 20 or not. We need to find a stronger argument to determine the behavior of the sequences as n approaches 200.

Let&#x27;s consider the sum S_n = x_n + y_n + z_n. We want to see how this sum behaves as n increases. We have:

S_(n+1) = x_(n+1) + y_(n+1) + z_(n+1)
         = (y_n + 1/z_n) + (z_n + 1/x_n) + (x_n + 1/y_n)
         = x_n + y_n + z_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)
         = S_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)

Since x_n, y_n, and z_n are all at least 2 (and increasing), the sum of their reciprocals is decreasing. This means that the amount by which S_n increases with each step is decreasing.

However, we still do not have a clear way to determine the exact behavior of w_200. We need to find a more direct approach to bounding the sequences or proving that w_200 can be both greater and smaller than 20 depending on the initial values.

Let&#x27;s consider the product P_n = x_n * y_n * z_n. We want to see how this product behaves as n increases. We have:

P_(n+1) = x_(n+1) * y_(n+1) * z_(n+1)
         = (y_n + 1/z_n) * (z_n + 1/x_n) * (x_n + 1/y_n)

Now, let&#x27;s expand this product using the distributive property and the identity (x ± y)^2 = x^2 ± 2xy + y^2:

P_(n+1) = y_n*z_n*x_n + y_n*z_n/y_n + z_n*x_n/z_n + x_n*y_n/x_n + 1/(x_n*y_n*z_n) + 1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n

Simplifying, we get:

P_(n+1) = P_n + 3 + 1/P_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)

Since P_n is the product of positive terms, it is also positive. Moreover, since x_n, y_n, and z_n are all at least 2, their reciprocals are at most 1/2, so the sum of the reciprocals is at most 3/2. This means that P_(n+1) is at least P_n + 3 + 1/P_n, which is greater than P_n since 3 + 1/P_n is positive.

This shows that the product P_n is monotonically increasing. However, this still does not give us a clear answer about w_200.

To proceed further, we need to consider the behavior of the sequences in more detail, possibly using more advanced techniques or additional properties of the sequences. Unfortunately, with the information provided and the analysis so far, we cannot conclusively determine whether w_200 is always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20. More information or a different approach is needed to solve this problem.</code></pre>
