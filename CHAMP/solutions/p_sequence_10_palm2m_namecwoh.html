<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and other fields. It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional arithmetic.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, which is equivalent to 5 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, which is equivalent to 0 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus. For example, you can divide 13 by 4 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 4 and 12 are relatively prime. The result of the division is 3. However, you cannot divide 13 by 12 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 12 and 12 are not relatively prime.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. It is the number that the other numbers are &quot;wrapped around&quot; to. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but it is a very powerful tool that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: divisibility rule for 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For example, 12 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 2 = 3. 15 is also divisible by 3 because 1 + 5 = 6. However, 14 is not divisible by 3 because 1 + 4 = 5.

Here is a more formal way of stating the divisibility rule for 3:

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

For example, let&#x27;s say we want to know if 123456789 is divisible by 3. We can do this by adding up the digits:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45

45 is divisible by 3, so 123456789 is also divisible by 3.

Here are some other examples:

* 12 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 2 = 3.
* 15 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 5 = 6.
* 14 is not divisible by 3 because 1 + 4 = 5.
* 21 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 1 = 3.
* 30 is divisible by 3 because 3 + 0 = 3.
* 42 is divisible by 3 because 4 + 2 = 6.
* 54 is divisible by 3 because 5 + 4 = 9.
* 66 is divisible by 3 because 6 + 6 = 12.
* 78 is divisible by 3 because 7 + 8 = 15.
* 81 is divisible by 3 because 8 + 1 = 9.
* 93 is divisible by 3 because 9 + 3 = 12.
* 105 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 0 + 5 = 6.
* 117 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 1 + 7 = 9.
* 129 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 2 + 9 = 12.
* 132 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
* 145 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 4 + 5 = 10.
* 158 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 5 + 8 = 14.
* 161 is not divisible by 3 because 1 + 6 + 1 = 8.
* 174 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 7 + 4 = 12.
* 187 is divisible by 3 because 1 + 8 + 7 = 16.
* 190 is not divisible by 3 because 1 + 9 + 0 = 10.
* 203 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 0 + 3 = 5.
* 216 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 1 + 6 = 9.
* 229 is not divisible by 3 because 2 + 2 + 9 = 13.
* 242 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.
* 255 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 5 + 5 = 12.
* 268 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 6 + 8 = 16.
* 281 is not divisible by 3 because 2 + 8 + 1 = 11.
* 294 is divisible by 3 because 2 + 9 + 4 = 15.
* 307 is divisible by 3 because 3 + 0 + 7 = 10.
* 310 is not divisible by 3 because 3 + 1 + 0 = 4.
* 323 is divisible by 3 because 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

Let a sequence be the defined as a_0=a_1=1, and a_(n+1)=a_(n-1)*a_n+1. What is a_1964 mod 4?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The sequence $a_n$ is defined as follows:

* $a_0 = a_1 = 1$
* $a_{n+1} = a_{n-1}a_n + 1$

We can write this recurrence relation in matrix form as follows:

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 1 \\\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}$$

The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $p(x) = x^2 - x - 1$. The roots of this polynomial are $x = 2 \pm \sqrt{3}$.

We can use the Cayley-Hamilton theorem to find the eigenvalues of $A$:

$$A^2 - A - I = 0$$

$$(2 \pm \sqrt{3})^2 - (2 \pm \sqrt{3}) - 1 = 0$$

$$4 \pm 4\sqrt{3} - 2 - \sqrt{3} = 0$$

$$4\sqrt{3} = 3$$

$$\sqrt{3} = \frac{3}{4}$$

We can use the eigenvalues to find the eigenvectors of $A$:

$$v_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \end{bmatrix}$$

$$v_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\ -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \end{bmatrix}$$

We can use the eigenvectors to find the general solution to the recurrence relation:

$$a_n = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2$$

We can use the initial conditions $a_0 = 1$ and $a_1 = 1$ to find $c_1$ and $c_2$:

$$a_0 = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 = 1$$

$$a_1 = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 = 1$$

$$c_1 + c_2 = 1$$

$$c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 = 1$$

$$c_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}c_2 = 1$$

$$\sqrt{3}c_1 + c_2 = \sqrt{3}$$

$$c_1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}c_2 = 1$$

$$2c_1 + 1 = \sqrt{3}$$

$$2c_1 = \sqrt{3} - 1$$

$$c_1 = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}$$

$$c_2 = 1 - c_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}$$

The general solution to the recurrence relation is therefore:

$$a_n = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}v_1 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}v_2$$

We can use this to find $a_{1964}$:

$$a_{1964} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2}v_1 + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2}v_2 = \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} = 1$$

Therefore, $a_{1964} \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$.</code></pre>
