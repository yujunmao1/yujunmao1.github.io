<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.
2. Find f(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).
3. Find g(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the recursive relationships for \( f(n) \) and \( g(n) \) as described. Let&#x27;s define \( f(n) \) and \( g(n) \) more precisely:

- \( f(n) \): the number of length-\( n \) strings ending with 1, where no two 1s are neighbors.
- \( g(n) \): the number of length-\( n \) strings ending with either 2 or 3, where no two 1s are neighbors.

We want to find \( f(5) + g(5) \), which is the total number of strings of length 5 with no two 1s as neighbors.

First, let&#x27;s find the recursive relationships for \( f(n+1) \) and \( g(n+1) \):

1. \( f(n+1) \): To form a string of length \( n+1 \) ending with 1, we can only add a 1 to strings of length \( n \) that end with 2 or 3 (to ensure no two 1s are neighbors). Therefore, \( f(n+1) = g(n) \).

2. \( g(n+1) \): To form a string of length \( n+1 \) ending with 2 or 3, we can add a 2 or a 3 to any string of length \( n \) (regardless of whether it ends with 1, 2, or 3). Since there are two choices (2 or 3) for the last digit, \( g(n+1) = 2 \times (f(n) + g(n)) \).

Now, let&#x27;s find the initial values for \( f(n) \) and \( g(n) \):

- \( f(1) \): There is only one string of length 1 ending with 1, which is &quot;1&quot; itself. So, \( f(1) = 1 \).
- \( g(1) \): There are two strings of length 1 ending with 2 or 3, which are &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. So, \( g(1) = 2 \).

Using the recursive relationships, we can now calculate \( f(n) \) and \( g(n) \) for \( n = 2, 3, 4, 5 \):

For \( n = 2 \):
- \( f(2) = g(1) = 2 \) (since we can only add a 1 to strings ending with 2 or 3).
- \( g(2) = 2 \times (f(1) + g(1)) = 2 \times (1 + 2) = 6 \).

For \( n = 3 \):
- \( f(3) = g(2) = 6 \).
- \( g(3) = 2 \times (f(2) + g(2)) = 2 \times (2 + 6) = 16 \).

For \( n = 4 \):
- \( f(4) = g(3) = 16 \).
- \( g(4) = 2 \times (f(3) + g(3)) = 2 \times (6 + 16) = 44 \).

For \( n = 5 \):
- \( f(5) = g(4) = 44 \).
- \( g(5) = 2 \times (f(4) + g(4)) = 2 \times (16 + 44) = 120 \).

Finally, the total number of strings of length 5 with no two 1s as neighbors is \( f(5) + g(5) = 44 + 120 = 164 \).

So, there are 164 such strings.</code></pre>
