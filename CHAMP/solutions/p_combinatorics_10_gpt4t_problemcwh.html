<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, as an expression of n?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. Insert dividers into the gaps, and consider the correspondance between a sequence with a divider insertion configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of finding the number of sequences of positive integer numbers that sum to n, we can use a combinatorial method known as &quot;stars and bars&quot; or &quot;balls and urns.&quot; The idea is to represent the sequence of positive integers as a sequence of stars, with bars (or dividers) separating the different numbers.

For example, if n = 5, one possible sequence is 1 + 1 + 3, which can be represented as:
* | * | * * *

Here, the stars represent the numbers, and the bars represent the dividers between them. Since we are looking for sequences of positive integers, we cannot have any group with zero stars, which means we must place at least one star in each group.

To find the number of such sequences, we need to determine the number of ways to place dividers between the stars. Since we have n stars, there are n - 1 gaps between them where dividers can be placed. If we want to create a sequence of k positive integers that sum to n, we need to place k - 1 dividers in these gaps.

However, the problem does not specify the length of the sequence (the number of positive integers), so we must consider all possible lengths from 1 to n. This means we can have anywhere from 0 to n - 1 dividers placed in the gaps.

Let&#x27;s calculate the number of ways to place these dividers:

1. If we have 0 dividers, there is only 1 sequence: n itself.
2. If we have 1 divider, we are creating a sequence of 2 positive integers. There are n - 1 gaps, so there are C(n - 1, 1) ways to place the divider.
3. If we have 2 dividers, we are creating a sequence of 3 positive integers. There are C(n - 1, 2) ways to place the dividers.
...
k. If we have k - 1 dividers, we are creating a sequence of k positive integers. There are C(n - 1, k - 1) ways to place the dividers.

We continue this process until we reach n - 1 dividers, which corresponds to a sequence of n positive integers, all of which are 1.

The total number of sequences is the sum of all these possibilities:
Total number of sequences = C(n - 1, 0) + C(n - 1, 1) + C(n - 1, 2) + ... + C(n - 1, n - 1)

Using the identity that the sum of the binomial coefficients for a given n is equal to 2^n, we have:
Total number of sequences = 2^(n - 1)

So, the number of sequences of positive integer numbers that sum to n is 2^(n - 1).</code></pre>
