If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is that if two numbers `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), then `a` will also be coprime with any power of `b`. This is because if `a` and `b` share no common factors other than 1, raising `b` to any power will not introduce any new factors that `a` could have in common with `b^n`.

Here&#x27;s an example applying this concept:

Let&#x27;s take `a = 3` and `b = 10`. We can see that `gcd(3, 10) = 1` because 3 and 10 share no common factors other than 1 (3 is prime and 10 is 2 times 5, which are both prime to 3).

Now, let&#x27;s consider `b^n` where `n = 2`. So we have `b^n = 10^2 = 100`. We want to find `gcd(3, 100)`.

Since 3 is prime and 100 is a product of 2&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s (specifically, 100 = 2^2 * 5^2), there are no common factors between 3 and 100. Therefore, `gcd(3, 100) = 1`.

This will hold true for any `n`. For instance, if `n = 3`, then `b^n = 10^3 = 1000`. Again, 1000 is made up of 2&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s (1000 = 2^3 * 5^3), and since 3 shares no common factors with 2 or 5, `gcd(3, 1000) = 1`.

In general, for any `n`, `gcd(a, b^n) = 1` as long as `gcd(a, b) = 1` and `a ≠ 1`.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The equation you&#x27;ve provided is a representation of the difference of squares, which is a factorization identity used in algebra. It states that the difference between the squares of two numbers `x` and `y` can be expressed as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers.

Here&#x27;s an example applying this concept:

Let&#x27;s take `x = 7` and `y = 4`. We want to calculate `x^2 - y^2` and show that it equals `(x + y)(x - y)`.

First, we calculate `x^2` and `y^2`:
- `x^2 = 7^2 = 49`
- `y^2 = 4^2 = 16`

Now, we calculate `x^2 - y^2`:
- `x^2 - y^2 = 49 - 16 = 33`

Next, we calculate `(x + y)(x - y)`:
- `x + y = 7 + 4 = 11`
- `x - y = 7 - 4 = 3`
- `(x + y)(x - y) = 11 * 3 = 33`

As we can see, `x^2 - y^2` is indeed equal to `(x + y)(x - y)` for `x = 7` and `y = 4`, since both expressions evaluate to 33. This demonstrates the difference of squares identity.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concepts you&#x27;ve listed are modular arithmetic properties, which are fundamental in number theory and are widely used in computer science, cryptography, and various mathematical computations. Let&#x27;s go through each property with an example:

1. Addition modulo `m`:
   `(a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m`

   Example:
   Let `a = 8`, `b = 5`, and `m = 3`.
   - `(a + b) mod m = (8 + 5) mod 3 = 13 mod 3 = 1`
   - `(a mod m) = 8 mod 3 = 2`
   - `(b mod m) = 5 mod 3 = 2`
   - `((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m = (2 + 2) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1`

   Both sides equal 1, confirming the property.

2. Subtraction modulo `m`:
   `(a - b) mod m = ((a mod m) - (b mod m)) mod m`

   Example:
   Let `a = 8`, `b = 5`, and `m = 3`.
   - `(a - b) mod m = (8 - 5) mod 3 = 3 mod 3 = 0`
   - `(a mod m) = 8 mod 3 = 2`
   - `(b mod m) = 5 mod 3 = 2`
   - `((a mod m) - (b mod m)) mod m = (2 - 2) mod 3 = 0 mod 3 = 0`

   Both sides equal 0, confirming the property.

3. Multiplication modulo `m`:
   `ab mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m`

   Example:
   Let `a = 8`, `b = 5`, and `m = 3`.
   - `ab mod m = (8 * 5) mod 3 = 40 mod 3 = 1`
   - `(a mod m) = 8 mod 3 = 2`
   - `(b mod m) = 5 mod 3 = 2`
   - `((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m = (2 * 2) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1`

   Both sides equal 1, confirming the property.

4. Exponentiation modulo `m`:
   `a^k mod m = ((a mod m)^k mod m)`

   Example:
   Let `a = 8`, `k = 2`, and `m = 3`.
   - `a^k mod m = 8^2 mod 3 = 64 mod 3 = 1`
   - `(a mod m) = 8 mod 3 = 2`
   - `((a mod m)^k mod m) = (2^2) mod 3 = 4 mod 3 = 1`

   Both sides equal 1, confirming the property.

These examples demonstrate that the modular arithmetic properties hold true for the given values of `a`, `b`, `k`, and `m`. These properties are very useful for simplifying calculations in modular arithmetic, especially when dealing with large numbers.</code></pre>

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
4. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
5. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
6. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
7. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive value of the absolute difference |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. Let&#x27;s follow the steps outlined:

1. **Expression equal to 0:**
   If |12^m - 5^n| = 0, then 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are coprime, there are no positive integer solutions for m and n that satisfy this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.

2. **Expression equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:**
   Since 12 and 5 are coprime, the difference |12^m - 5^n| cannot be 5, as that would imply one term is a multiple of 5 and the other is not, which is impossible given their prime factorizations. For the other values (2, 3, 4, 6), we would need to find m and n such that 12^m and 5^n are very close to each other, differing by one of these small numbers. This is not easy to achieve due to the rapid growth of both 12^m and 5^n, and we would need to check individual cases, which is not practical.

3. **Expression equal to 1 (12^m - 5^n = 1):**
   If 12^m - 5^n = 1, then 5^n = 12^m - 1. The right side of the equation is one less than a power of 12, which means it is not divisible by 3. Since 5^n is never divisible by 3 for any positive integer n, there are no solutions in this case.

4. **Expression equal to 1 (5^n - 12^m = 1):**
   If 5^n - 12^m = 1, then 5^n = 12^m + 1. Considering this equation modulo 3, we have:
   - 5^n ≡ 1 (mod 3) for any n, since 5 ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 2^n ≡ 1 (mod 3) for any even n.
   - 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3) for any m, since 12 ≡ 0 (mod 3).
   Therefore, for the equation to hold, n must be even.

5. **For even n, factor 5^n - 1 into P and Q:**
   If n is even, we can write 5^n - 1 as (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). Both factors P = 5^(n/2) + 1 and Q = 5^(n/2) - 1 must be powers of 12 for the expression to be 1. However, since P and Q differ by 2, they cannot both be powers of 12, as 12^m for m &gt; 0 is always divisible by 4, and thus P and Q would differ by at least 4.

6. **Recognize 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m:**
   Since 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we need to split the prime factors 2 and 3 among P and Q. However, as established, P and Q cannot both be powers of 12, so this is not possible.

7. **Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3:**
   Since P and Q differ by 2, they cannot both be divisible by 3. Therefore, this case does not provide a solution.

8. **Study possible solutions of the factor splitting:**
   Given the constraints above, we cannot find a solution where |12^m - 5^n| = 1.

Since we have ruled out the possibility of the expression being 0 or 1, and the difficulties in achieving the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, we need to look for the smallest value greater than 1. We can do this by trial and error, starting with small values of m and n and calculating |12^m - 5^n|.

Let&#x27;s try m = 1 and n = 1:
- |12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7

Now, let&#x27;s try m = 2 and n = 1:
- |12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139

We can see that the difference is growing larger. Let&#x27;s try with m = 1 and n = 2:
- |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13

Again, the difference is larger than 7. Let&#x27;s try incrementing n while keeping m small:
- For m = 1 and n = 3: |12^1 - 5^3| = |12 - 125| = 113
- For m = 2 and n = 2: |12^2 - 5^2| = |144 - 25| = 119

We can see that the differences are getting larger. We need to find a pair (m, n) such that the difference is smaller than 7. Since 7 is the smallest we&#x27;ve found so far, we can try to find if there&#x27;s a combination that gives us a difference of 2, 3, 4, or 6.

By trial and error, we find that for m = 2 and n = 3:
- |12^2 - 5^3| = |144 - 125| = 19

This is still larger than 7. We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that finding a difference of 2, 3, 4, or 6 is not straightforward. The smallest difference we&#x27;ve found so far is 7, for m = 1 and n = 1.

Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n, based on the trials we&#x27;ve conducted, is 7.</code></pre>
