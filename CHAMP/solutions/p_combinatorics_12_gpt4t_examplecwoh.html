<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using the concept of permutations. The problem essentially asks for the number of permutations of the sequence {1, 2, ..., n} such that for each i, a_i is not greater than i. This is because if a_i were greater than i, it would mean that the i-th car is trying to park in a lot that comes after its own number, which is not possible since all lots before it would be occupied by cars with lower numbers.

To solve this problem, we can consider the choices each driver has when they arrive at their favorite parking lot:

- The first driver (car 1) has only one choice for parking, which is lot 1 (p_1 = 1).
- The second driver (car 2) has two choices: if lot 1 is free, they can park there; otherwise, they can park in lot 2 (p_2 = 2).
- The third driver (car 3) has three choices: they can park in lot 1, lot 2, or lot 3, depending on which ones are free (p_3 = 3).
- ...
- The n-th driver (car n) has n choices, as they can park in any lot from 1 to n that is free (p_n = n).

Since each driver&#x27;s choice is independent of the others, we can apply the concept that the total number of ways to park all cars is the product of the number of choices each driver has. Therefore, the total number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is:

Total number of sequences = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * ... * p_n
                          = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n
                          = n!

So, the expression for the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is n!, which is the factorial of n.</code></pre>
