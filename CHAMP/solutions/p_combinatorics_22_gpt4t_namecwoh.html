<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, without considering the order in which they are chosen. This is often referred to as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is denoted by C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to be chosen.

The combination formula is given by:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let&#x27;s break down the formula:

- n! is the factorial of the total number of items, which represents the number of ways to arrange all n items in a sequence.
- k! is the factorial of the number of items chosen, which accounts for the fact that the order of selection within the chosen subset does not matter.
- (n - k)! is the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items chosen, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining items that were not chosen.

By dividing n! by the product of k! and (n - k)!, we effectively count each subset of size k exactly once, regardless of the order in which its elements are listed.

For example, if you have a set of 5 items (n = 5) and you want to know how many ways you can choose 2 items (k = 2) from this set, you would calculate it as follows:

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1) * (3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.

So there are 10 different ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5.

The combination formula is widely used in probability theory, statistics, and various fields where the concept of selecting subsets is relevant. It is also closely related to the binomial theorem, which describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of r elements from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, we need to consider how many times each number can be the smallest element in a subset of size r.

Let&#x27;s take a specific number i (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n - r + 1, because i must leave enough room for r - 1 other elements to be chosen after it). We want to count the number of subsets of size r where i is the smallest element. Once we&#x27;ve chosen i as the smallest element, we need to choose the remaining r - 1 elements from the set {i+1, i+2, ..., n}, which has n - i elements.

The number of ways to choose these r - 1 elements from the remaining n - i elements is given by the combination formula:

C(n - i, r - 1)

Now, we need to sum this count for each possible smallest element i, from 1 to n - r + 1. The sum of the counts will give us the total number of times any number is the smallest element across all subsets of size r:

Sum = C(n - 1, r - 1) + C(n - 2, r - 1) + ... + C(r - 1, r - 1)

Notice that each term in the sum is the number of combinations of choosing r - 1 elements from a decreasing number of elements, starting from n - 1 and going down to r - 1.

To find the arithmetic mean, we need to divide this sum by the total number of subsets of size r, which is C(n, r). However, we also need to multiply each term in the sum by the value of the smallest element i that it represents. This gives us the total sum of the smallest elements across all subsets.

Total sum of smallest elements = 1 * C(n - 1, r - 1) + 2 * C(n - 2, r - 1) + ... + (n - r + 1) * C(r - 1, r - 1)

Now, we can calculate the arithmetic mean by dividing this total sum by the total number of subsets of size r:

Arithmetic mean = (Total sum of smallest elements) / C(n, r)

Unfortunately, there is no straightforward simplification for the total sum of the smallest elements, and it does not directly reduce to a simple expression involving only n and r. However, we can recognize that the sum resembles the (r-1)th forward difference of the sequence of binomial coefficients, which is a known combinatorial identity. The sum can be expressed in terms of n and r using advanced combinatorial arguments or generating functions, but it is beyond the scope of elementary combinatorics.

To solve this problem completely, we would need to invoke these more advanced techniques or perform the summation explicitly, which could be quite involved.</code></pre>
