Let n&gt;1 be an integer. There are n lamps L_0, ..., L_(n−1) arranged in a circle. Each lamp is either ON or OFF. A sequence of steps S_0, ..., S_i, ... is carried out. Step S_j affects the state of L_j only (leaving the states of all other lamps unaltered) as follows: if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON; if L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. The lamps are labeled modulo n, that is, L_(−1)=L_(n−1), L_0=L_n, L_1=L_(n+1). Initially all lamps are ON. For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider a sequence (x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_(n-1))=(1, 1, 1, ..., 1) representing the initial state of the lamp, and each S_j appends the new state of the lamp being affected to the sequence.
2. Find a formula for x_(j+1) given x_0, ..., x_j.
3. Let v_j=[x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)] be a binary vector.
4. Study any possible repetitions in the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ...
5. Study if the mapping from v_j to v_(j+1) is invertible, and its implication on the repetition of sequence values.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s start by analyzing the given information.

1. The initial state of the lamps is represented by the sequence (x_0, x_1, x_2, ..., x_(n-1)) = (1, 1, 1, ..., 1), where 1 represents the ON state.

2. We need to find a formula for x_(j+1) given x_0, ..., x_j. From the problem statement, we know that if L_(j−1) is ON, S_j changes the state of L_j from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. If L_(j−1) is OFF, S_j leaves the state L_j unchanged. Therefore, we can define the formula as follows:

   x_(j+1) = (x_j + x_(j-1)) % 2

   This formula represents the XOR operation between x_j and x_(j-1), which gives us the new state of the lamp L_j.

3. Let v_j = [x_j, x_(j+1), ..., x_(j+n-1)] be a binary vector. This vector represents the state of the lamps affected by step S_j.

4. We need to study any possible repetitions in the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ... to determine if the sequence of switching can return all lamps to the ON state.

5. We need to study if the mapping from v_j to v_(j+1) is invertible, and its implication on the repetition of sequence values.

Now, let&#x27;s use this information to solve the problem.

First, let&#x27;s consider the case when n = 2. In this case, we have two lamps L_0 and L_1. The sequence of steps S_0, S_1, ... will be:

S_0: L_0 -&gt; L_1
S_1: L_1 -&gt; L_0

We can see that after two steps, the lamps return to their initial state. Therefore, for n = 2, the sequence of switching can always return all lamps to the ON state.

Next, let&#x27;s consider the case when n = 3. In this case, we have three lamps L_0, L_1, and L_2. The sequence of steps S_0, S_1, S_2, ... will be:

S_0: L_0 -&gt; L_1
S_1: L_1 -&gt; L_2
S_2: L_2 -&gt; L_0

We can see that after three steps, the lamps return to their initial state. Therefore, for n = 3, the sequence of switching can always return all lamps to the ON state.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case when n = 4. In this case, we have four lamps L_0, L_1, L_2, and L_3. The sequence of steps S_0, S_1, S_2, S_3, ... will be:

S_0: L_0 -&gt; L_1
S_1: L_1 -&gt; L_2
S_2: L_2 -&gt; L_3
S_3: L_3 -&gt; L_0

We can see that after four steps, the lamps return to their initial state. Therefore, for n = 4, the sequence of switching can always return all lamps to the ON state.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that for all n in {2, 3, 4}, the sequence of switching can always return all lamps to the ON state.

To determine the pattern for larger values of n, we need to analyze the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ...

Let&#x27;s start by calculating the values of v_0, v_1, v_2, ... for n = 5:

v_0 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
v_1 = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
v_2 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
v_3 = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
v_4 = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
...

We can see that v_2 and v_4 are repeated. This means that the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ... will repeat after v_2. Therefore, the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state for n = 5.

By analyzing the sequence of vectors v_0, v_1, v_2, ... for larger values of n, we can observe that the sequence will repeat after v_2 for odd values of n, and after v_4 for even values of n.

Therefore, for n &gt; 4, the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state if n is odd.

In summary, for n in {2, 3, 4}, the sequence of switching can always return all lamps to the ON state. For n &gt; 4, the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state if n is odd.

Final Answer: For n in {2, 3, ..., 100}, there are 49 values of n (all odd values) for which the sequence of switching will not be able to return all lamps to the ON state.</code></pre>
