<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s follow the given information and steps:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By adding the (n+1)-th lot, we create a circular arrangement of the parking lots, where the last lot is connected to the first lot.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

For every driver to be able to park, it means that there should be no consecutive occupied lots. In other words, no two adjacent lots should be occupied.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

Let&#x27;s consider a sequence {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} where each a_i represents the favorite parking lot of driver i. Since each driver has n+1 choices (n parking lots + the circular lot), the total number of possible sequences is (n+1)^n.

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Now, we need to determine how many of these sequences lead to a valid parking configuration. To do this, we will consider each sequence and its n cyclically shifted versions.

For a given sequence {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}, we can cyclically shift it by moving the last element to the first position. This creates a new sequence. We can repeat this process n times to obtain n cyclically shifted versions of the original sequence.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze each cyclically shifted version of the sequence. If any of these versions have two adjacent occupied lots, it means that the original sequence does not lead to a valid parking configuration. Otherwise, if all the cyclically shifted versions have no adjacent occupied lots, it means that the original sequence does lead to a valid parking configuration.

Therefore, the number of valid parking configurations is equal to the number of sequences {a} such that all of its n cyclically shifted versions have no adjacent occupied lots.

To find this number, we need to count the number of sequences {a} that satisfy this condition.

Let&#x27;s consider a sequence {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} that satisfies the condition. If we fix the first element a_1, there are (n+1)-1 = n choices for the second element a_2 (excluding a_1). Similarly, there are n choices for the third element a_3, and so on, until there are 2 choices for the last element a_n. Finally, there is only one choice for the first element a_1 (since it is fixed).

Therefore, the number of sequences {a} that satisfy the condition is n * n * ... * 2 * 1 = n!.

Hence, the final answer to the problem is n!.

To summarize:
- The total number of possible sequences {a} is (n+1)^n.
- The number of valid parking configurations is n!.

Therefore, the expression for the number of sequences {a} that satisfy the given condition is n!.</code></pre>
