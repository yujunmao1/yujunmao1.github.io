Find all possible positive integer values of x such that x, 2x+1 and 4x+1 are all prime numbers.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find all positive integer values of x such that x, 2x+1, and 4x+1 are all prime numbers. Let&#x27;s analyze the conditions:

1. x is a prime number.
2. 2x+1 is a prime number.
3. 4x+1 is a prime number.

We know that except for the number 2, all prime numbers are odd. This is because if a number is even (and greater than 2), it can be divided by 2, and thus it is not prime.

Let&#x27;s consider the first few positive integers and see if they satisfy the conditions:

- If x = 1, then 2x+1 = 3 and 4x+1 = 5, which are both prime. However, x itself is not prime because 1 is not considered a prime number.
- If x = 2, then 2x+1 = 5 and 4x+1 = 9. While 5 is prime, 9 is not prime because it is divisible by 3. Therefore, x = 2 does not satisfy the conditions.

Now, let&#x27;s assume x is an odd prime number greater than 2. Then x is of the form 2n+1 for some integer n. Let&#x27;s substitute this into the expressions for 2x+1 and 4x+1:

2x+1 = 2(2n+1)+1 = 4n+3
4x+1 = 4(2n+1)+1 = 8n+5

Since x is odd, 4n+3 will also be odd, which is a good sign for it being prime. However, 8n+5 is also odd, and we need to ensure it is prime as well.

Notice that if n is even, then 4n+3 will be congruent to 3 (mod 4), which is a possible form for a prime number. However, if n is odd, then 4n+3 will be congruent to 7 (mod 4), which is also a possible form for a prime number. So, we cannot determine the primality of 4n+3 based solely on the parity of n.

Now, let&#x27;s look at 8n+5. If n is even, then 8n+5 will be congruent to 5 (mod 8), which is a possible form for a prime number. However, if n is odd, then 8n+5 will be congruent to 13 (mod 8), which is also a possible form for a prime number. Again, we cannot determine the primality of 8n+5 based solely on the parity of n.

Since we cannot determine the primality of 4n+3 and 8n+5 based solely on the parity of n, we need to check individual cases for x being an odd prime number greater than 2.

Let&#x27;s check the next few odd primes:

- If x = 3, then 2x+1 = 7 and 4x+1 = 13, which are both prime. So, x = 3 is a solution.
- If x = 5, then 2x+1 = 11 and 4x+1 = 21. But 21 is not prime because it is divisible by 3 and 7. So, x = 5 is not a solution.
- If x = 7, then 2x+1 = 15 and 4x+1 = 29. But 15 is not prime because it is divisible by 3 and 5. So, x = 7 is not a solution.

We can continue this process, but we can also notice a pattern that will help us eliminate many cases. Since 2x+1 and 4x+1 must be prime, and all primes greater than 2 are odd, x must be even to make 2x+1 and 4x+1 odd. However, the only even prime number is 2, which we have already checked and found not to work.

Therefore, the only positive integer value of x such that x, 2x+1, and 4x+1 are all prime numbers is x = 3.</code></pre>
