A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

a_n = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + ... + 1/(2^n)

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is positive, so adding another term to the sum will always make the sum larger. In other words, for all n in the natural numbers, a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

The sequence is also bounded above. Specifically, it is bounded by the sum of the infinite series:

S = 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ...

This is a geometric series with the first term a = 1 and the common ratio r = 1/2. The sum of an infinite geometric series with |r| &lt; 1 is given by the formula S = a / (1 - r). In this case, the sum is:

S = 1 / (1 - 1/2) = 1 / (1/2) = 2

Therefore, the sequence (a_n) is bounded above by 2.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 2. So, we can say that:

lim (n -&gt; ∞) a_n = 2

This means that as n becomes very large, the value of a_n gets arbitrarily close to 2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The statement &quot;For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y) if and only if x ≥ y&quot; is a property of square roots that holds true for all non-negative real numbers. Let&#x27;s apply this concept with a specific example:

Let x = 16 and y = 9, which are both non-negative numbers.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the square roots of both numbers:

sqrt(x) = sqrt(16) = 4
sqrt(y) = sqrt(9) = 3

We can see that sqrt(x) = 4 is greater than sqrt(y) = 3. According to the property, this should mean that x is also greater than y. Indeed, we have:

x = 16 &gt; 9 = y

This example confirms the property: since sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y), it follows that x ≥ y. Conversely, because x ≥ y, we can also conclude that sqrt(x) ≥ sqrt(y). This is a bidirectional implication, meaning that one statement implies the other and vice versa, but it is important to note that this property only holds for non-negative values of x and y, as square roots of negative numbers are not real numbers (they are complex numbers).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Does the limit exist for the sequence defined by a_0=0, a_(n+1)=sqrt(4+3a_n), and if so, find it.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if the limit exists for the sequence defined by a_0 = 0 and a_(n+1) = sqrt(4 + 3a_n), we can first check if the sequence is monotonic and bounded.

Let&#x27;s start by showing that the sequence is monotonically increasing. We will use induction.

Base case (n = 0): a_0 = 0 and a_1 = sqrt(4 + 3a_0) = sqrt(4 + 3*0) = sqrt(4) = 2. Since a_1 &gt; a_0, the base case holds.

Inductive step: Assume that a_n &gt; a_(n-1) for some n ≥ 1. We need to show that a_(n+1) &gt; a_n.

a_(n+1) = sqrt(4 + 3a_n) (by the recursive definition)
a_n = sqrt(4 + 3a_(n-1)) (by the recursive definition)

Since we are assuming a_n &gt; a_(n-1), and because the square root function is monotonically increasing for non-negative arguments (as discussed earlier), it follows that:

sqrt(4 + 3a_n) &gt; sqrt(4 + 3a_(n-1))

Therefore, a_(n+1) &gt; a_n, which completes the inductive step.

Now we have shown that the sequence is monotonically increasing.

Next, we need to show that the sequence is bounded above. Notice that for all n, a_n must be non-negative because it is defined as a square root. Now, let&#x27;s assume that the sequence is bounded above by some number M. For the sequence to remain bounded as n increases, we need:

a_(n+1) = sqrt(4 + 3a_n) ≤ M

Squaring both sides, we get:

4 + 3a_n ≤ M^2

Since a_n is non-negative, we can choose M such that M^2 is greater than 4. Let&#x27;s choose M = 3, then M^2 = 9, and we have:

4 + 3a_n ≤ 9
3a_n ≤ 5
a_n ≤ 5/3

So, if a_n ≤ 5/3, then a_(n+1) will also be less than or equal to 5/3, which means the sequence is bounded above by 5/3.

Now that we have established that the sequence is monotonically increasing and bounded above, we can conclude that the sequence has a limit.

Let&#x27;s denote the limit of the sequence as L. Then, taking the limit on both sides of the recursive definition, we get:

lim (n -&gt; ∞) a_(n+1) = lim (n -&gt; ∞) sqrt(4 + 3a_n)

Since the sequence has a limit, we can write:

L = sqrt(4 + 3L)

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we get:

L^2 = 4 + 3L

Rearranging the terms, we have a quadratic equation:

L^2 - 3L - 4 = 0

Factoring the quadratic, we get:

(L - 4)(L + 1) = 0

This gives us two potential solutions for L: L = 4 or L = -1. However, since the sequence consists of non-negative terms (as they are defined by square roots), we must discard the negative solution. Therefore, the limit of the sequence is L = 4.

In conclusion, the limit of the sequence defined by a_0 = 0 and a_(n+1) = sqrt(4 + 3a_n) exists and is equal to 4.</code></pre>
