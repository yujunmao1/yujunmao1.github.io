Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.

Suppose you have a box of 12 eggs. You count the eggs once and get a total of 12 counts. This means that you have counted each egg once. If you count the eggs again, you will get a total of 24 counts. This means that you have counted each egg twice. If you count the eggs a third time, you will get a total of 36 counts. This means that you have counted each egg three times. And so on.

In general, if you count each object d times, you will get a total of n counts, where n is the number of objects. So, if you have n objects and you count each object d times, you will get a total of n*d counts.

There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

However, some of these ways are not valid. For example, you cannot choose the same type of bread twice. So, we need to remove the invalid ways.

There are 3 ways to choose the bread, so there are 3 ways to choose the bread twice. There are 5 ways to choose the filling, so there are 5 ways to choose the filling twice. There are 2 ways to choose the condiments, so there are 2 ways to choose the condiments twice. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose two actions that cannot be performed at the same time.

We need to remove these 30 ways from the total number of ways to make a sandwich. So, the number of valid ways to make a sandwich is $300 - 30 = 270$.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 6! = 720 ways to color the faces of a cube with 6 different colors. However, many of these colorings are equivalent up to rotations. For example, the colorings red, green, blue, yellow, white, and black are all equivalent to the colorings black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow.

To count the number of distinct colorings, we can first consider the case where the second face is painted on the top. There are 5! = 120 ways to color the remaining four faces. For each of these colorings, there are 4! = 24 ways to rotate the cube so that the second face is on top. So, there are $5! \times 4! = 1440$ colorings where the second face is painted on the top.

Now, consider the case where the second face is painted on the side. There are 4! = 24 ways to color the remaining four faces. For each of these colorings, there are 6 ways to rotate the cube so that the second face is on the side. So, there are $4! \times 6 = 144$ colorings where the second face is painted on the side.

In total, there are $1440 + 144 = 1584$ distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors.

Here is a more detailed solution:

We can think of the coloring of a cube as a function from the set of faces of the cube to the set of colors. Two colorings are equivalent if they are the same function after applying a rotation of the cube.

Let $f$ be a coloring of a cube with 6 different colors. We can think of $f$ as a function from the set of faces of the cube to the set of colors, where $f(f)$ is the color of the face $f$.

Let $F$ be the set of faces of the cube. Then, $f$ is a function from $F$ to $\\{$red, green, blue, yellow, white, black\\}$.

The number of ways to choose a function from $F$ to $\\{$red, green, blue, yellow, white, black\\}$ is $6!$.

However, many of these functions are equivalent up to rotations. For example, the functions $f$ and $g$ defined by

$$f(f) = \text{red}, f(g) = \text{green}, f(h) = \text{blue}, f(i) = \text{yellow}, f(j) = \text{white}, f(k) = \text{black}$$

and

$$g(f) = \text{green}, g(g) = \text{red}, g(h) = \text{blue}, g(i) = \text{yellow}, g(j) = \text{white}, g(k) = \text{black}$$

are equivalent, since they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube.

To count the number of distinct colorings, we can first consider the case where the second face is painted on the top. There are 5! = 120 ways to color the remaining four faces. For each of these colorings, there are 4! = 24 ways to rotate the cube so that the second face is on top. So, there are $5! \times 4! = 1440$ colorings where the second face is painted on the top.

Now, consider the case where the second face is painted on the side. There are 4! = 24 ways to color the remaining four faces. For each of these colorings, there are 6 ways to rotate the cube so that the second face is on the side. So, there are $4! \times 6 = 144$ colorings where the second face is painted on the side.

In total, there are $1440 + 144 = 1584$ distinct colorings of a cube with 6 different colors.</code></pre>
