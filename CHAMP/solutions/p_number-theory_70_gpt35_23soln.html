Find all positive integer solutions to the equation 2^x+1=3^y.

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. The obvious solutions are x=1, y=1 and x=3, y=2.
2. For x≥4 and odd y, we have 2^x=3^y-1=(3-1)(3^(y-1)+3^(y-2)+...+3+1).
3. The second term in the product is a sum of odd number of odd values, and not divisible by 2.
4. Thus, the product is not divisible by 4, which contradicts with the fact that 2^x is divisible by 4 for x≥4.
5. So we have no solution here.
6. For x≥4 and even y, let y=2k and we have 2^x=3^(2k)-1=(3^k)^2-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>7. We can rewrite the equation as 2^x = (3^k + 1)(3^k - 1).
8. Notice that (3^k + 1) and (3^k - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
9. Since they are consecutive even numbers, one of them must be divisible by 4.
10. However, 3^k + 1 cannot be divisible by 4 because it leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.
11. Therefore, (3^k - 1) must be divisible by 4.
12. This implies that 3^k - 1 = 2^m for some positive integer m.
13. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^k = 2^m + 1.
14. This is a similar equation to the original one, but with different variables.
15. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
16. The obvious solutions are k=1, m=1 and k=2, m=3.
17. For k≥3 and odd m, we have 3^k = 2^m + 1.
18. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
19. For k≥3 and even m, let m=2n and we have 3^k = (2^n + 1)(2^n - 1).
20. Again, notice that (2^n + 1) and (2^n - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
21. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^n + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^n - 1) must be divisible by 4.
22. This implies that 2^n - 1 = 3^p for some positive integer p.
23. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^n = 3^p + 1.
24. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
25. The obvious solutions are n=1, p=1 and n=2, p=2.
26. For n≥3 and odd p, we have 2^n = 3^p + 1.
27. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
28. For n≥3 and even p, let p=2q and we have 2^n = (3^q + 1)(3^q - 1).
29. Again, notice that (3^q + 1) and (3^q - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
30. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^q + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (3^q - 1) must be divisible by 4.
31. This implies that 3^q - 1 = 2^r for some positive integer r.
32. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^q = 2^r + 1.
33. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
34. The obvious solutions are q=1, r=1 and q=2, r=3.
35. For q≥3 and odd r, we have 3^q = 2^r + 1.
36. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
37. For q≥3 and even r, let r=2s and we have 3^q = (2^s + 1)(2^s - 1).
38. Again, notice that (2^s + 1) and (2^s - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
39. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^s + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^s - 1) must be divisible by 4.
40. This implies that 2^s - 1 = 3^t for some positive integer t.
41. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^s = 3^t + 1.
42. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
43. The obvious solutions are s=1, t=1 and s=2, t=2.
44. For s≥3 and odd t, we have 2^s = 3^t + 1.
45. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
46. For s≥3 and even t, let t=2u and we have 2^s = (3^u + 1)(3^u - 1).
47. Again, notice that (3^u + 1) and (3^u - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
48. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^u + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (3^u - 1) must be divisible by 4.
49. This implies that 3^u - 1 = 2^v for some positive integer v.
50. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^u = 2^v + 1.
51. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
52. The obvious solutions are u=1, v=1 and u=2, v=3.
53. For u≥3 and odd v, we have 3^u = 2^v + 1.
54. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
55. For u≥3 and even v, let v=2w and we have 3^u = (2^w + 1)(2^w - 1).
56. Again, notice that (2^w + 1) and (2^w - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
57. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^w + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^w - 1) must be divisible by 4.
58. This implies that 2^w - 1 = 3^z for some positive integer z.
59. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^w = 3^z + 1.
60. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
61. The obvious solutions are w=1, z=1 and w=2, z=2.
62. For w≥3 and odd z, we have 2^w = 3^z + 1.
63. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
64. For w≥3 and even z, let z=2x and we have 2^w = (3^x + 1)(3^x - 1).
65. Again, notice that (3^x + 1) and (3^x - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
66. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^x + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (3^x - 1) must be divisible by 4.
67. This implies that 3^x - 1 = 2^y for some positive integer y.
68. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^x = 2^y + 1.
69. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
70. The obvious solutions are x=1, y=1 and x=2, y=3.
71. For x≥3 and odd y, we have 3^x = 2^y + 1.
72. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
73. For x≥3 and even y, let y=2z and we have 3^x = (2^z + 1)(2^z - 1).
74. Again, notice that (2^z + 1) and (2^z - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
75. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^z + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^z - 1) must be divisible by 4.
76. This implies that 2^z - 1 = 3^w for some positive integer w.
77. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^z = 3^w + 1.
78. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
79. The obvious solutions are z=1, w=1 and z=2, w=2.
80. For z≥3 and odd w, we have 2^z = 3^w + 1.
81. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
82. For z≥3 and even w, let w=2v and we have 2^z = (3^v + 1)(3^v - 1).
83. Again, notice that (3^v + 1) and (3^v - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
84. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^v + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (3^v - 1) must be divisible by 4.
85. This implies that 3^v - 1 = 2^u for some positive integer u.
86. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^v = 2^u + 1.
87. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
88. The obvious solutions are v=1, u=1 and v=2, u=3.
89. For v≥3 and odd u, we have 3^v = 2^u + 1.
90. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
91. For v≥3 and even u, let u=2t and we have 3^v = (2^t + 1)(2^t - 1).
92. Again, notice that (2^t + 1) and (2^t - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
93. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^t + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^t - 1) must be divisible by 4.
94. This implies that 2^t - 1 = 3^s for some positive integer s.
95. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^t = 3^s + 1.
96. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
97. The obvious solutions are t=1, s=1 and t=2, s=2.
98. For t≥3 and odd s, we have 2^t = 3^s + 1.
99. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
100. For t≥3 and even s, let s=2r and we have 2^t = (3^r + 1)(3^r - 1).
101. Again, notice that (3^r + 1) and (3^r - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
102. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^r + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (3^r - 1) must be divisible by 4.
103. This implies that 3^r - 1 = 2^q for some positive integer q.
104. Rearranging the equation, we have 3^r = 2^q + 1.
105. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
106. The obvious solutions are r=1, q=1 and r=2, q=3.
107. For r≥3 and odd q, we have 3^r = 2^q + 1.
108. Using similar reasoning as before, we can show that there are no solutions for this case.
109. For r≥3 and even q, let q=2p and we have 3^r = (2^p + 1)(2^p - 1).
110. Again, notice that (2^p + 1) and (2^p - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
111. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 2^p + 1 cannot be divisible by 4, (2^p - 1) must be divisible by 4.
112. This implies that 2^p - 1 = 3^n for some positive integer n.
113. Rearranging the equation, we have 2^p = 3^n + 1.
114. We can repeat the same steps as before to find solutions for this equation.
115. The obvious solutions are p=1, n=1 and p=2, n=2.

119. Again, notice that (3^m + 1) and (3^m - 1) are consecutive even numbers.
120. One of them must be divisible by 4, and since 3^m + 1 cannot be divisible</code></pre>
