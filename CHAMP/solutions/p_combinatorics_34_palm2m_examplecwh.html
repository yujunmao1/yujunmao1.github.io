Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

Suppose you want to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear. There are 5 different shirts to choose from, 3 different pants to choose from, and 2 different shoes to choose from. No two items can be worn at the same time, so you can&#x27;t wear a shirt and pants at the same time, or a shirt and shoes at the same time. So, there are $5 \times 3 \times 2 = 30$ ways to choose a shirt, pants, and shoes to wear.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to choose a car, a house, and a pet. There are 10 different cars to choose from, 5 different houses to choose from, and 3 different pets to choose from. No two items can be owned at the same time, so you can&#x27;t own a car and a house at the same time, or a car and a pet at the same time. So, there are $10 \times 5 \times 3 = 150$ ways to choose a car, a house, and a pet.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. Insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points and study the formation of the group of k points.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $n$ be a positive integer. We want to count the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers, where $k&lt;n-1$.

We can think of this problem as the following: we have a row of $n$ points, with $n-1$ gaps. We want to insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points, such that each group contains at least one point. The number of groups is then the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the following algorithm:

1. Start with the empty row.
2. For each point in the row, insert a divider after it.
3. If the number of groups is $k$, stop. Otherwise, go back to step 2.

The number of times that $k$ appears in the final row is the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers.

To see why this algorithm works, note that each time we insert a divider, we are creating a new group. The number of groups is then the number of dividers we have inserted. If we insert $k$ dividers, then the number of groups is $k$.

The number of times that $k$ appears in the final row is the number of times that we have inserted a divider after a point with value $k$. This is because each time we insert a divider after a point with value $k$, we are creating a group that contains $k$ points.

Therefore, the number of times that $k$ appears in the final row is the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers.

For example, consider the case where $n=6$ and $k=3$. The following is one way to express $6$ as the sum of $3$ positive integers:

$6=3+2+1$

We can insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points as follows:

$6=3+2+1$

The number of groups is $3$, which is the number of ways to express $6$ as the sum of $3$ positive integers.

The number of times that $3$ appears in the final row is $2$, which is the number of ways to express $6$ as the sum of $3$ positive integers that include $3$.

Therefore, the number of times that $k$ appears in the final row is the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers.

In general, the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers is given by the following formula:

$$\binom{n+k-1}{k}$$

This formula can be derived using the following argument:

We can think of the problem of expressing $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers as the following: we have a set of $n+k-1$ objects, and we want to choose $k$ of them to add together. The number of ways to do this is given by the following formula:

$$\binom{n+k-1}{k}$$

However, we need to divide this number by $k!$, since the order in which we choose the objects does not matter.

Therefore, the number of ways to express $n$ as the sum of $k$ positive integers is given by the following formula:

$$\binom{n+k-1}{k} \div k!$$</code></pre>
