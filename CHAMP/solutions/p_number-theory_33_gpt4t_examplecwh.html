<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If ab | c, then a | c and b | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The statement &quot;If ab | c, then a | c and b | c&quot; is not generally true. The correct statement should be &quot;If ab | c, then a | c or b | c is not necessarily true, but if a and b are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), then a | c and b | c.&quot;

Let&#x27;s give an example where a and b are coprime:

Let a = 3, b = 4, and c = 12.

Since 3 and 4 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), we can check if both 3 and 4 divide 12.

Indeed, 3 | 12 because 12 ÷ 3 = 4, which is an integer.
And 4 | 12 because 12 ÷ 4 = 3, which is also an integer.

Since both a and b divide c, and ab (which is 3 × 4 = 12) also divides c, the statement holds true in this case.

However, if a and b are not coprime, it is not necessarily true that both a and b divide c. For example:

Let a = 6, b = 4, and c = 24.

Here, ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and indeed ab | c because 24 ÷ 24 = 1, which is an integer.

However, while it is true that 6 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 6 = 4) and 4 | 24 (since 24 ÷ 4 = 6), this does not always hold for non-coprime a and b. If we change c to 48, then:

ab = 6 × 4 = 24, and ab | 48 because 48 ÷ 24 = 2, which is an integer.

But if we take a = 6 and b = 4, they are not coprime (they share a common divisor of 2), and while it is still true that 6 | 48 and 4 | 48, if we had a different c where the common divisor of a and b does not divide c, the statement would not hold. For example, if c were 36, then ab = 24 does not divide 36, and while 6 divides 36, 4 does not.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s take m = 7 and choose a = 8 and b = 5 for our example. We will apply each of the modular arithmetic properties you&#x27;ve listed.

1. Addition modulo m:
(a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m

(8 + 5) mod 7 = 13 mod 7 = 6

Now, let&#x27;s calculate it using the property:
(8 mod 7) + (5 mod 7) = 1 + 5 = 6
6 mod 7 = 6

Both methods give us the same result: 6.

2. Subtraction modulo m:
(a - b) mod m = ((a mod m) - (b mod m)) mod m

(8 - 5) mod 7 = 3 mod 7 = 3

Now, let&#x27;s calculate it using the property:
(8 mod 7) - (5 mod 7) = 1 - 5 = -4
Since we want a non-negative result, we can add 7 (which is m) to -4 until we get a non-negative result:
-4 + 7 = 3
3 mod 7 = 3

Both methods give us the same result: 3.

3. Multiplication modulo m:
ab mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m

(8 * 5) mod 7 = 40 mod 7 = 5

Now, let&#x27;s calculate it using the property:
(8 mod 7) * (5 mod 7) = 1 * 5 = 5
5 mod 7 = 5

Both methods give us the same result: 5.

4. Exponentiation modulo m:
a^k mod m = ((a mod m)^k) mod m

Let&#x27;s choose k = 2 for this example.
(8^2) mod 7 = 64 mod 7 = 1

Now, let&#x27;s calculate it using the property:
(8 mod 7)^2 = 1^2 = 1
1 mod 7 = 1

Both methods give us the same result: 1.

In each case, the properties of modular arithmetic hold true, and both methods of calculation yield the same result.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is based on the fact that if two numbers `a` and `b` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor gcd(a, b) is 1), then `a` will also be coprime with any power of `b` (i.e., `b^n` for any positive integer `n`).

Let&#x27;s take an example where `a = 3` and `b = 10`. We know that gcd(3, 10) = 1 because 3 and 10 have no common divisors other than 1, which means they are coprime.

Now, let&#x27;s consider `b^n` where `n = 2`. So, `b^n = 10^2 = 100`.

We need to show that gcd(a, b^n) = gcd(3, 100) = 1.

The prime factorization of 100 is 2^2 * 5^2, and the prime factorization of 3 is just 3 (since 3 is a prime number). Since there are no common prime factors between 3 and 100, their greatest common divisor is indeed 1.

This will hold true for any power of `b`. For example, if `n = 3`, then `b^n = 10^3 = 1000`. The prime factorization of 1000 is 2^3 * 5^3, which still shares no common factors with 3. Therefore, gcd(3, 1000) = 1.

In general, if gcd(a, b) = 1 and `a ≠ 1`, then for any positive integer `n`, gcd(a, b^n) will always be 1, because raising `b` to a power does not introduce any new prime factors that could be common with `a`.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. 1971=27*73.
2. Find a mod 27 and a mod 73.
3. Set up the equation of a=27x+p=73y+q for suitable p, q and starting from y=0, increment y to find the smallest value that satisfy the equation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest positive integer `a` such that `1971 | 50^n + 23^n * a` for odd `n`, we need to consider the prime factorization of 1971, which is `1971 = 27 * 73`. Since 27 and 73 are coprime, we need to find `a` such that both `27 | 50^n + 23^n * a` and `73 | 50^n + 23^n * a`.

Let&#x27;s first consider the case for `n` being odd and `27 | 50^n + 23^n * a`. Since `n` is odd, we can use Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, which states that if `p` is a prime number and `a` is not divisible by `p`, then `a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)`. However, 27 is not prime, but we can still use the theorem for its prime factor, which is 3.

For `50^n mod 27`, we know that `50 ≡ 23 (mod 27)` because `50 - 23 = 27`, which is a multiple of 27. Therefore, `50^n ≡ 23^n (mod 27)` for any integer `n`.

Now, let&#x27;s find `23^n mod 27`. Since `gcd(23, 27) = 1`, we can apply Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem for the prime factor 3 of 27. We have `23^2 ≡ 1 (mod 3)`, and since `27 = 3^3`, we can expect a similar pattern with a period that is a divisor of 3^2 = 9. By checking small powers of 23, we find that `23^3 ≡ -1 (mod 27)` and `23^6 ≡ 1 (mod 27)`. Since `n` is odd, `23^n ≡ 23 (mod 27)`.

Now we want to find `a` such that `23^n * a ≡ -50^n (mod 27)`. Since `50^n ≡ 23^n (mod 27)`, we have `23^n * a ≡ -23^n (mod 27)`. This simplifies to `a ≡ -1 (mod 27)`.

Next, we consider `73 | 50^n + 23^n * a`. Since `gcd(50, 73) = 1` and `gcd(23, 73) = 1`, we can apply Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem directly here. We have `50^72 ≡ 1 (mod 73)` and `23^72 ≡ 1 (mod 73)`.

For odd `n`, we have `50^n ≡ 50 (mod 73)` and `23^n ≡ 23 (mod 73)` because `n` is not a multiple of 72 and thus does not complete a full cycle in the exponent to return to 1.

We want to find `a` such that `23^n * a ≡ -50^n (mod 73)`, which simplifies to `23 * a ≡ -50 (mod 73)`. We can solve this congruence for `a`:

`23 * a ≡ 73 - 50 (mod 73)`
`23 * a ≡ 23 (mod 73)`
`a ≡ 1 (mod 73)`

Now we have two congruences:
`a ≡ -1 (mod 27)` which is equivalent to `a ≡ 26 (mod 27)`
`a ≡ 1 (mod 73)`

We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve these simultaneous congruences. We want to find the smallest positive integer `a` such that:

`a = 27x + 26 = 73y + 1`

Starting with `y = 0`, we increment `y` to find the smallest value that satisfies the equation:

For `y = 0`, `a = 73(0) + 1 = 1`, which does not satisfy the first congruence.
