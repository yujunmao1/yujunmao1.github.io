<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let A be a string of n binary digits (leading 0s are allowed). How many such strings have the substring &quot;01&quot; appearing exactly m times, as an expression of m and n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the string, we add 1 to the front and 0 to the back, and consider the n+1 gaps between the n+2 digits.
2. For the two digits around the gap, if they are &quot;01&quot;, we call the gap a &quot;0-1&quot; transition, and analogously a &quot;1-0&quot; transition, or neither.
3. We note that prepending with 1 and appending with 0 does not create new 01 substrings, or in other words &quot;0-1&quot; transitions.
4. Thus, there are m &quot;0-1&quot; transitions.
5. Since &quot;0-1&quot; transitions must interleave with &quot;1-0&quot; transitions, and the first and last transitions are &quot;1-0&quot; transitions (because we add 1 and 0 to the front and back), we have m+1 &quot;1-0&quot; transitions.
6. Thus, among n+1 gaps, we need to choose 2m+1 of them to insert these 2m+1 transitions, and each choice of 2m+1 gaps leads to one unique set of (alternating) transitions, which corresponds to one string with m &quot;01&quot; substrings.
7. So the total number of such strings is C(n+1, 2m+1).

Problem: In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let H(n, r) represent the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups (where horses in each group are tied).
2. We have H(n, 1)=1 for all n, since there is only one way that all groups are tied.
3. To calculate H(n, r), we add a new horse to the race result of n-1 horses.
4. The new horse can be in its own finishing group, in which case we require that there are r-1 finishing groups originally.
5. For each race result in H(n-1, r-1), the new horse can be inserted into one of r slots (first, in between two groups and last), so we have H(n-1, r-1)*r groups.
6. The new horse can also be in a tied position, in which case we require that there are r finishing groups originally.
7. For each race result in H(n-1, r), the new horse can be tied in one of r groups, so we have H(n-1, r)*r groups.
8. Adding these two ways together, we have H(n, r)=(H(n-1, r-1)+H(n-1, r))*r, with H(a, b)=0 for b&gt;a (because the number of finishing groups cannot be larger than the number of horses).
9. Thus, the number of ways that n horses can finish is P(n)=H(n, 1)+H(n, 2)+...+H(n, n).
10. Plugging in the numbers, we get: H(1, 1)=1, H(2, 1)=1, H(2, 2)=2, H(3, 1)=1, H(3, 2)=6, H(3, 3)=6, H(4, 1)=1, H(4, 2)=14, H(4, 3)=36, H(4, 4)=24.
11. So P(4)=1+14+36+24=75.

Problem: For positive integers a, b, c, d, e satisfying a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25=0, what are possible values of abcde mod 5?
Step-wise solution:
1. If 5 ∤ abcde, then none of a, b, c, d, e is divisible by 5.
2. For 5 ∤ u, we have u=5k±1 or u=5k±2.
3. For u=5k±1, u^5=(5k±1)^5=(5k)^5±5*(5k)^4+10*(5k)^3±10*(5k)^2+5*(5k)±1, and u^5 mod 25=±1.
4. For u=5k±2, u^5=(5k±2)^5=(5k)^5±5*(5k)^4*2+10*(5k)^3*4±10*(5k)^2*8+5*(5k)*16±32, and u^5 mod 25=±7.
5. Thus, in a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25, each u^5 contributes ±1 or ±7.
6. No addition of five of these numbers result in a multiple of 25.
7. Thus, 25 ∤ a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5.
8. This means that if a^5+b^5+c^5+d^5+e^5 mod 25=0, we must have abcde mod 5=0.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to count the number of strings of length \( n \) consisting of digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have an even number of 1s.

Let&#x27;s denote by \( E_n \) the number of strings of length \( n \) with an even number of 1s, and by \( O_n \) the number of strings with an odd number of 1s.

For a string of length \( n \), there are 4 choices for the first digit, 4 choices for the second digit, and so on, leading to \( 4^n \) total strings without any restrictions.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the following two cases for constructing a string of length \( n+1 \) from a string of length \( n \):

1. If we have a string of length \( n \) with an even number of 1s (count \( E_n \)), we can append any of the digits 2, 3, or 4 to maintain an even number of 1s. This gives us \( 3E_n \) possibilities.

2. If we have a string of length \( n \) with an odd number of 1s (count \( O_n \)), we can append the digit 1 to switch to an even number of 1s. This gives us \( O_n \) possibilities.

Therefore, for a string of length \( n+1 \), the number of strings with an even number of 1s is given by:
\[ E_{n+1} = 3E_n + O_n \]

Similarly, for a string of length \( n+1 \) with an odd number of 1s, we can consider the following:

1. If we have a string of length \( n \) with an even number of 1s, we can append the digit 1 to get an odd number of 1s. This gives us \( E_n \) possibilities.

2. If we have a string of length \( n \) with an odd number of 1s, we can append any of the digits 2, 3, or 4 to maintain an odd number of 1s. This gives us \( 3O_n \) possibilities.

So, for a string of length \( n+1 \), the number of strings with an odd number of 1s is given by:
\[ O_{n+1} = E_n + 3O_n \]

We also know that \( E_n + O_n = 4^n \) because this represents all possible strings of length \( n \).

Now, let&#x27;s find the initial conditions for \( n = 1 \):
- \( E_1 \) is the number of strings of length 1 with an even number of 1s, which is 3 (the digits 2, 3, and 4).
- \( O_1 \) is the number of strings of length 1 with an odd number of 1s, which is 1 (the digit 1).

Using these initial conditions and the recursive relations, we can express \( E_{n+1} \) in terms of \( E_n \) and \( O_n \):
\[ E_{n+1} = 3E_n + (4^n - E_n) \]
\[ E_{n+1} = 2E_n + 4^n \]

We can solve this recurrence relation to find \( E_n \). However, we can also notice that for every string of length \( n \), there is an equal chance of having an even or odd number of 1s since the digits are chosen independently. Therefore, half of the \( 4^n \) strings will have an even number of 1s, and the other half will have an odd number of 1s.

Thus, the number of strings of length \( n \) with an even number of 1s is:
\[ E_n = \frac{4^n}{2} = 2^{2n-1} \]

This is the final expression for the number of strings of length \( n \) consisting of digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have an even number of 1s.</code></pre>
