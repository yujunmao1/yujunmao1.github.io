<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.
Step-wise solution:
1. For n people, C(n, k) corresponds to the number of possible ways to choose k people, and k^2 correponds to the number of ways to assign two roles, one per person, with one person holding two roles allowed.
2. Thus, we can consider the full expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
3. If the president and the secretary are the same person, we can first choose this person, with n possibilties, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-1 people, with 2^(n-1) possibilities.
4. If the president and the secretary are different people, we can first choose those two, with n(n-1) possibilities, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-2 people, with 2^(n-2) possibilities.
5. Thus, the total number of choices is n*2^(n-1)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=2n*2^(n-2)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=n(n+1)*2^(n-2).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. For a convex polygon of n vertices, we draw all possible diagonals and suppose that no three diagonals pass through the same point. How many such intersection points do we have in the interior of the polygon, as an expression of n?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. An intersection point is created from two diagnonals.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to determine how many intersection points are created by the diagonals of a convex polygon with n vertices.

First, let&#x27;s consider how many diagonals a convex polygon has. A convex polygon with n vertices has a total of n(n-3)/2 diagonals. This is because each vertex can be connected to n-3 other vertices (excluding itself and the two adjacent vertices), and since each diagonal is counted twice (once for each end), we divide by 2.

Now, let&#x27;s consider how many diagonals intersect at a single point. Since no three diagonals pass through the same point, each intersection is formed by exactly two diagonals. Therefore, each intersection point corresponds to a unique combination of two diagonals.

To find the number of intersection points, we need to count the number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of n, because each intersection point is determined by choosing two pairs of vertices that form two diagonals that intersect. The number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of n is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, 4).

Therefore, the number of intersection points in the interior of the polygon is given by the expression:

C(n, 4) = n! / (4! * (n-4)!)

This is the closed-form formula for the number of intersection points created by the diagonals in the interior of a convex polygon with n vertices.</code></pre>
