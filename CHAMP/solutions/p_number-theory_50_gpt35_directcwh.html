Find the five-digit number abcde such that 4*abcde=edcba.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Find values of a, e, b in that order.
2. A number is a multiple of 4 if and only if the number consisting of its last two digit is divisible by 4.
3. Find the values of c and d together by setting up an equation of the multiplicative relationship.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s break it down step by step.

1. Find values of a, e, b in that order:
Since 4 * abcde = edcba, we know that e must be even because it is the last digit of the product. Therefore, e can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Let&#x27;s try each of these values one by one.

If e = 0:
4 * abc0 = 0dcba
Since the last digit of the product is 0, we know that c must be 0. However, this would make the number abcde a four-digit number, which contradicts the given information that it is a five-digit number. Therefore, e cannot be 0.

If e = 2:
4 * abc2 = 2dcba
Since the last digit of the product is 2, we know that c must be 8 or 3. Let&#x27;s try each of these values.

If c = 8:
4 * ab82 = 28ba8
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 8, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If c = 3:
4 * ab23 = 32ba3
This equation is also not possible because the last digit of the product is 3, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If e = 4:
4 * abc4 = 4dcba
Since the last digit of the product is 4, we know that c must be 2 or 7. Let&#x27;s try each of these values.

If c = 2:
4 * ab24 = 42ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If c = 7:
4 * ab74 = 47ba4
This equation is possible because the last digit of the product is 4, and the last digit of the number on the right side is also 4. Let&#x27;s continue with this value of c.

If e = 6:
4 * abc6 = 6dcba
Since the last digit of the product is 6, we know that c must be 1 or 6. Let&#x27;s try each of these values.

If c = 1:
4 * ab16 = 61ba6
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 6, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 1.

If c = 6:
4 * ab76 = 67ba6
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 6, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 7.

If e = 8:
4 * abc8 = 8dcba
Since the last digit of the product is 8, we know that c must be 4 or 9. Let&#x27;s try each of these values.

If c = 4:
4 * ab48 = 84ba8
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 8, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 4.

If c = 9:
4 * ab98 = 98ba8
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 8, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 9.

Therefore, the only possible value for e is 4, and the only possible value for c is 7.

2. A number is a multiple of 4 if and only if the number consisting of its last two digits is divisible by 4:
Since the number abcde is a multiple of 4, the number formed by the last two digits, de, must also be divisible by 4. Therefore, the possible values for de are 12, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 44, 48, 52, 56, 64, 68, 72, 76, 84, 88, 92, 96.

3. Find the values of c and d together by setting up an equation of the multiplicative relationship:
We know that c = 7, so we need to find the value of d. Let&#x27;s try each possible value for de and see which one satisfies the equation.

If de = 12:
4 * ab7 = 12ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If de = 16:
4 * ab7 = 16ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 6.

If de = 24:
4 * ab7 = 24ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 4.

If de = 28:
4 * ab7 = 28ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 8.

If de = 32:
4 * ab7 = 32ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If de = 36:
4 * ab7 = 36ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 6.

If de = 44:
4 * ab7 = 44ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 4.

If de = 48:
4 * ab7 = 48ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 8.

If de = 52:
4 * ab7 = 52ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If de = 56:
4 * ab7 = 56ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 6.

If de = 64:
4 * ab7 = 64ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 4.

If de = 68:
4 * ab7 = 68ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 8.

If de = 72:
4 * ab7 = 72ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If de = 76:
4 * ab7 = 76ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 6.

If de = 84:
4 * ab7 = 84ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 4.

If de = 88:
4 * ab7 = 88ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 8.

If de = 92:
4 * ab7 = 92ba4
This equation is not possible because the last digit of the product is 4, but the last digit of the number on the right side is 2.

If de = 96:
4 * ab7 = 96ba4
This equation is possible because the last digit of the product is 4, and the last digit of the number on the right side is also 4.

Therefore, the only possible value for de is 96.

Now, let&#x27;s find the values of a and b.

4 * ab7 = 964a4
We can rewrite this equation as:
4 * (1000a + 100b + 70 + 7) = 964a4
Expanding the equation:
4000a + 400b + 280 + 28 = 964a4
Combining like terms:
4000a + 400b + 308 = 964a4
Subtracting 4000a from both sides:
400b + 308 = 964a4 - 4000a
400b + 308 = 564a4
Dividing both sides by 4:
100b + 77 = 141a

Since a, b, and c are digits, a must be either 1 or 2. Let&#x27;s try each of these values.

If a = 1:
100b + 77 = 141
Subtracting 77 from both sides:
100b = 64
Dividing both sides by 100:
b = 0.64
Since b must be a digit, this value is not possible.

If a = 2:
100b + 77 = 282
Subtracting 77 from both sides:
100b = 205
Dividing both sides by 100:
b = 2.05
Since b must be a digit, this value is not possible.

Therefore, there is no solution to the equation 4 * abcde = edcba.

Final Answer: There is no five-digit number abcde such that 4 * abcde = edcba.</code></pre>
