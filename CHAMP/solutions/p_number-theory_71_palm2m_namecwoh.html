<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical formula that can be used to find the square of the difference of two numbers. The formula is:

$(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$

For example, if we want to find the square of the difference of 3 and 4, we would use the formula as follows:

$(3 - 4)^2 = 3^2 - 2(3)(4) + 4^2 = 9 - 24 + 16 = 1$

The difference of squares formula can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, we can use it to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 3 and a width of 4. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

$A = lw$

In this case, the area is:

$A = 3 \times 4 = 12$

We can also use the difference of squares formula to find the distance between two points. The distance between two points is given by the formula:

$d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$

In this case, the distance is:

$d = \sqrt{(3 - 4)^2 + (1 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{26} \approx 5.12$

The difference of squares formula is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, because 13 - 12 = 1.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. It can also be used to solve problems in everyday life, such as finding the day of the week on a given date.

There are a few basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, and 13 - 4 = 9.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, but 52 % 12 = 8.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are less than or equal to the modulus. For example, 13 / 4 = 3, but 13 / 5 = 2 (with a remainder of 3).
* The modulus is always a positive integer.
* The modulus must be greater than or equal to 2.
* The modulus must be relatively prime to the number of digits in the numbers being used.

Modular arithmetic can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, you can use it to find the day of the week on a given date. To do this, you would first find the remainder when the date is divided by 7. The remainder will be the day of the week. For example, if the date is 2023-02-24, then the remainder when divided by 7 is 2, so the day of the week is Tuesday.

You can also use modular arithmetic to solve problems in computer science. For example, you can use it to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that is a factor of both numbers. To find the greatest common divisor using modular arithmetic, you would first find the remainder when each number is divided by the modulus. Then, you would find the remainder when the two remainders are divided by the modulus. The remainder of this division will be the greatest common divisor.

Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is often used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. It can also be used to solve problems in everyday life, such as finding the day of the week on a given date.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The smallest value of $|12^m - 5^n|$ is 1.

We can prove this by contradiction. Suppose that there exists a positive integer $m$ such that $|12^m - 5^n| &gt; 1$. Then, we can write $12^m - 5^n = 2k$ for some integer $k$. This implies that $12^m$ is even, which means that $m$ is even.

Let $m = 2k$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can write $12^m - 5^n = 12^{2k} - 5^n = (12^k)^2 - 5^n$. We can factor this as follows:

$$(12^k)^2 - 5^n = (12^k - 5)(12^k + 5)$$

Since $12^k$ is even, $12^k - 5$ is odd. Therefore, $12^k + 5$ must also be odd. This implies that $12^k + 5$ is divisible by 11.

But this is a contradiction, because $12^k$ is divisible by 3, and 5 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, there cannot exist a positive integer $m$ such that $|12^m - 5^n| &gt; 1$.

Therefore, the smallest value of $|12^m - 5^n|$ is 1.</code></pre>
