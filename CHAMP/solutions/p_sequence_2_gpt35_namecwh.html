<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: square of sum and difference formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to expand the square of a binomial expression. It is derived from the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the square of their sum and the square of their difference can be expressed as follows:

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Square of the sum:
To find the square of the sum of two numbers, a and b, we square each term individually and then add the cross product of the two terms. The formula (a + b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)
           = a(a + b) + b(a + b)
           = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2
           = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

2. Square of the difference:
To find the square of the difference between two numbers, a and b, we follow a similar process. The formula (a - b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a - b)
           = a(a - b) - b(a - b)
           = a^2 - ab - ba + b^2
           = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

The key difference between the two formulas is the sign of the cross product term. In the square of the sum formula, the cross product term is positive (+2ab), while in the square of the difference formula, the cross product term is negative (-2ab).

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to expand binomial expressions and work with them more easily.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a fundamental inequality in mathematics that relates to the dot product (also known as the inner product) of vectors. It is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Hermann Amandus Schwarz, who independently discovered it.

The inequality states that for any two vectors, u and v, in an inner product space, the absolute value of their dot product is always less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes:

|u · v| ≤ ||u|| ||v||

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the components of the inequality:

- u · v: This represents the dot product (inner product) of vectors u and v. It is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of the vectors and summing them up.

- ||u||: This represents the magnitude (or length) of vector u. It is calculated using the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

- ||v||: This represents the magnitude (or length) of vector v. It is calculated using the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality essentially states that the absolute value of the dot product of two vectors is always less than or equal to the product of their magnitudes. In other words, the dot product is maximized when the vectors are parallel or antiparallel, and it is minimized when the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular).

The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has various applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. It is used in linear algebra, functional analysis, optimization problems, and even in probability theory. It provides a useful tool for proving other mathematical inequalities and establishing bounds in various contexts.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a_n=x_n+y_n+z_n.
2. Derive a lower bound on a_2.
3. For positive x, x+1/x≥2, with equality if and only if x=1.
4. Compare a_n with 18n for all n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s analyze the given information and use it to determine the behavior of the sequence {w_n}.

1. Let&#x27;s start by finding a relationship between the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n}, and {a_n}.

From the given information, we know that a_n = x_n + y_n + z_n. We can rewrite the recursive definitions of {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n} in terms of {a_n} as follows:

x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n

Adding these three equations together, we get:

x_(n+1) + y_(n+1) + z_(n+1) = (y_n + 1/z_n) + (z_n + 1/x_n) + (x_n + 1/y_n)
                           = (x_n + y_n + z_n) + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)
                           = a_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)

Therefore, we have the relationship:

a_(n+1) = a_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)

2. Now, let&#x27;s derive a lower bound on a_2.

Using the given inequality x + 1/x ≥ 2 (with equality if and only if x = 1), we can apply it to each term in the expression for a_2:

a_2 = x_2 + y_2 + z_2
    = (y_1 + 1/z_1) + (z_1 + 1/x_1) + (x_1 + 1/y_1)
    ≥ 2 + 2 + 2
    = 6

So, we have a lower bound on a_2: a_2 ≥ 6.

3. Now, let&#x27;s compare a_n with 18n for all n.

We want to determine if a_n is always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20.

To do this, we can compare a_n with 18n for all n. If a_n is always greater than 18n, then it will also be greater than 20 for n ≥ 2.

Using the recursive relationship derived earlier, we can express a_(n+1) in terms of a_n:

a_(n+1) = a_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n)

Now, let&#x27;s compare a_(n+1) with 18(n+1):

a_(n+1) - 18(n+1) = a_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n) - 18n - 18

Since we have a lower bound on a_2 (a_2 ≥ 6), we can start the comparison from n = 2.

For n = 2, we have:

a_3 - 18(3) = a_2 + (1/x_2 + 1/y_2 + 1/z_2) - 54

Since a_2 ≥ 6 and (1/x_2 + 1/y_2 + 1/z_2) &gt; 0, we can conclude that a_3 - 18(3) &gt; 0.

Now, let&#x27;s assume that a_n - 18n &gt; 0 for some n ≥ 2. We want to show that a_(n+1) - 18(n+1) &gt; 0.

a_(n+1) - 18(n+1) = a_n + (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n) - 18n - 18

Since a_n - 18n &gt; 0 (our assumption), and (1/x_n + 1/y_n + 1/z_n) &gt; 0, we can conclude that a_(n+1) - 18(n+1) &gt; 0.

By induction, we can conclude that a_n - 18n &gt; 0 for all n ≥ 2.

Therefore, a_n is always greater than 18n for n ≥ 2, which implies that a_n is always greater than 20 for n ≥ 2.

In conclusion, for different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, the sequence {w_n} (the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n) is always greater than 20 for n ≥ 2.</code></pre>
