<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental algebraic identity that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

For any two numbers a and b,

a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b)

This identity is derived from the expansion of the product of two binomials. If you take the binomials (a + b) and (a - b) and multiply them, you get:

(a + b)(a - b) = a² - ab + ab - b²

Notice that the middle terms, -ab and +ab, cancel each other out, leaving you with:

a² - b²

This formula is particularly useful in factoring expressions and solving equations that involve the difference of squares. It is also used in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.

For example, if you have the expression 49 - 36, you can recognize that 49 is 7² and 36 is 6². Using the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression as:

49 - 36 = 7² - 6² = (7 + 6)(7 - 6) = 13 * 1 = 13

This formula is also helpful when simplifying fractions that involve the difference of squares in the numerator or denominator, or when integrating or differentiating functions that can be expressed as a difference of squares.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of powers formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of powers formula refers to a set of identities used to factor expressions that involve the difference between two terms raised to a power. The most commonly used difference of powers formula is for the difference of two squares, which I&#x27;ve already explained. However, there are also formulas for higher powers, such as the difference of cubes and the general difference of nth powers.

Here are the formulas for the difference of cubes and the general difference of nth powers:

**Difference of Cubes:**
For any two numbers a and b,

a³ - b³ = (a - b)(a² + ab + b²)

This formula allows you to factor the difference of two cubes into the product of a linear term (a - b) and a quadratic term (a² + ab + b²).

**General Difference of nth Powers:**
For any two numbers a and b and a positive integer n,

aⁿ - bⁿ = (a - b)(aⁿ⁻¹ + aⁿ⁻²b + aⁿ⁻³b² + ... + abⁿ⁻² + bⁿ⁻¹)

This formula factors the difference of two nth powers into the product of a linear term (a - b) and a sum of n-1 terms, where each term is a product of powers of a and b with exponents that add up to n-1.

The general formula is particularly useful when n is odd because when n is even, aⁿ - bⁿ can&#x27;t be factored over the real numbers (since even powers represent squares, and the difference of squares doesn&#x27;t have real roots unless a = b).

For example, let&#x27;s factor the difference of fifth powers for a and b:

a⁵ - b⁵ = (a - b)(a⁴ + a³b + a²b² + ab³ + b⁴)

This formula is not typically used for even powers because, as mentioned, the difference of even powers does not factor nicely over the real numbers. However, for odd powers, it provides a systematic way to break down the expression into more manageable parts for further manipulation or simplification.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider (n-1)n(n+1) as a product of two co-prime numbers.
2. If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.
3. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m represents the product of three consecutive integers equal to a perfect mth power, where a &gt; 0 and m &gt; 1. To solve this equation, we need to consider the properties of consecutive integers and the properties of prime factorization.

First, let&#x27;s consider the three consecutive integers n-1, n, and n+1. Since they are consecutive, we know that:

1. They can have no common prime factors.
2. Exactly one of them is divisible by 2, and if n is even, then n-1 and n+1 are odd.
3. If n is odd, then n-1 and n+1 are even, and one of them is divisible by 2 but not by 4.

Now, let&#x27;s analyze the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m. We can see that (n-1), n, and (n+1) are pairwise coprime because they are consecutive integers. By the given information, if the product of two coprime numbers is a perfect power, then each must be a perfect power itself.

Let&#x27;s denote (n-1) = x^p, n = y^q, and (n+1) = z^r, where x, y, and z are integers, and p, q, and r are positive integers. Since n-1, n, and n+1 are consecutive, one of these must be divisible by 2, and at most one of them can be divisible by 2 to a power higher than 1 (since they are consecutive).

We have three cases to consider:

Case 1: n is even.
In this case, n = 2^q * k, where k is odd (since n is the only even number among n-1, n, and n+1). Then (n-1) and (n+1) are both odd, and they are coprime to n. Since n is a power of a, (n-1) and (n+1) must also be powers of a, but since they are odd, this is impossible because a &gt; 0 and a^m is even. Therefore, this case yields no solutions.

Case 2: n is odd, and n-1 is divisible by 2 but not by 4.
In this case, n-1 = 2^p * l, where l is odd. Then n and n+1 are both odd and coprime to n-1. Since n-1 is a power of a, n and n+1 must also be powers of a, but this is impossible because they are odd and a^m is even. Therefore, this case also yields no solutions.

Case 3: n is odd, and n+1 is divisible by 2 but not by 4.
This case is symmetric to Case 2 and also yields no solutions for the same reason.

Since none of the cases yield solutions, we conclude that there are no possible integer solutions for n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1 that satisfy the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m.</code></pre>
