<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider an example involving counting books on a bookshelf.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with several rows of books, and you want to count the total number of books. However, instead of counting each book once, you decide to count each book three times (perhaps to triple-check your count).

After going through the counting process, you find that you have counted a total of n = 90 counts. Since you counted each book d = 3 times, you want to find out the actual number of books on the shelf.

According to the concept, to find the actual number of books, you would divide the total number of counts by the number of times you counted each book:

Number of books = n / d
                = 90 / 3
                = 30

So, there are 30 books on the bookshelf.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>When n people are seated around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements (where rotations are considered the same) is different from the number of linear arrangements. In a linear arrangement, all n! permutations are distinct because the position of each person is fixed relative to the start of the line. However, in a circular arrangement, we consider two arrangements the same if you can rotate one arrangement to get the other.

To find the number of distinct circular arrangements, we can fix one person&#x27;s position (to prevent counting rotations as different arrangements) and then arrange the remaining (n-1) people in the remaining seats.

If we fix one person, there are (n-1)! ways to arrange the remaining people around the table. This is because, after fixing one person, we essentially have a linear arrangement of (n-1) seats.

However, we must also consider that in a circular arrangement, arrangements that are mirror images of each other (reflections) are also considered the same. To account for this, we would divide by 2 if the table arrangement is such that reflections are considered identical. But in the general case where reflections are considered distinct, we do not divide by 2.

So, the number of distinct arrangements around a circular table, where rotations are considered the same, is given by:

Number of distinct circular arrangements = (n-1)!

This formula assumes that reflections are considered distinct. If reflections are also considered the same, then the formula would be different, and we would need additional information to determine the correct count.</code></pre>
