<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all two-digit automorphic numbers besides 25.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 10≤a≤99 and since a^2 ends in a, a^2-a ends in 00.
2. So 100 | a(a-1).
3. Since gcd(a, a-1)=1, we have one of a and a-1 being a multiple of 4, and the other being a multiple of 25, subject to 10≤a≤99 (or one being a multiple of 100, but this is impossible because a is a two-digit number).
4. If 25 | a and 4 | a-1, the only solution is a=25, as introduced in the question.
5. If 25 | a-1 and  4 | a, the only solution is a=76, with 76^2=5776.
6. So the answer is 76.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all three-digit automorphic numbers.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider the last three digit of a^2-a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all three-digit automorphic numbers, we will follow a similar approach to the one used for finding two-digit automorphic numbers. Let&#x27;s denote our three-digit automorphic number as \( a \).

Since \( a \) is automorphic, \( a^2 \) ends in \( a \). This means that \( a^2 - a \) ends in 000, as subtracting \( a \) from \( a^2 \) would remove the last three digits of \( a^2 \) and replace them with zeros.

Therefore, we have that \( 1000 \) divides \( a(a - 1) \), or \( 1000 | a(a - 1) \).

Now, we need to consider the prime factorization of 1000, which is \( 2^3 \cdot 5^3 \). Since \( a \) and \( a - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime, which means that one of them must be divisible by \( 2^3 \) and the other by \( 5^3 \).

Let&#x27;s consider the two cases:

1. \( 8 | a \) and \( 125 | a - 1 \)
2. \( 8 | a - 1 \) and \( 125 | a \)

For the first case, \( a \) must be a multiple of 8, and \( a - 1 \) must be a multiple of 125. Since \( a \) is a three-digit number, the smallest multiple of 125 that is a three-digit number is 125 itself, but \( a - 1 \) cannot be 125 since \( a \) would then be 126, which is not a multiple of 8. The next multiple of 125 is 250, which would make \( a = 251 \), but 251 is not a multiple of 8. The next one is 375, which would make \( a = 376 \), and 376 is a multiple of 8. We can check if 376 is automorphic:

\( 376^2 = 141376 \)

Indeed, 376 is automorphic because \( 376^2 \) ends in 376.

For the second case, \( a - 1 \) must be a multiple of 8, and \( a \) must be a multiple of 125. The smallest three-digit multiple of 125 is 125, but \( a - 1 \) would then be 124, which is not a multiple of 8. The next multiple of 125 is 250, which would make \( a = 250 \), but \( a - 1 \) is 249, not a multiple of 8. The next one is 375, which would make \( a = 375 \), but \( a - 1 \) is 374, not a multiple of 8. The next one is 500, which would make \( a = 500 \), but \( a - 1 \) is 499, not a multiple of 8. The next one is 625, which would make \( a = 625 \), but \( a - 1 \) is 624, and 624 is a multiple of 8. We can check if 625 is automorphic:

\( 625^2 = 390625 \)

Indeed, 625 is automorphic because \( 625^2 \) ends in 625.

Continuing this process, we would check the multiples of 125 within the range of three-digit numbers (up to 999) and see if \( a - 1 \) is a multiple of 8. However, since we are looking for all three-digit automorphic numbers, we can stop here as we have found the two automorphic numbers in this range: 376 and 625.

Therefore, the three-digit automorphic numbers are 376 and 625.</code></pre>
