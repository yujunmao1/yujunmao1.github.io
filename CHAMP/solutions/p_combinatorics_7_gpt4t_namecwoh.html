<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. The rule of sum is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are two or more mutually exclusive events or scenarios.

Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur at the same time; in other words, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. The rule of sum states that if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and another event can occur in \(n\) ways, and the two events cannot occur simultaneously, then there are \(m + n\) ways for either of the events to occur.

Here&#x27;s a simple example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you have a menu with 3 different appetizers and 4 different desserts. If you want to choose either an appetizer or a dessert, but not both, the rule of sum tells you that there are \(3 + 4 = 7\) different choices you can make.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the choices are mutually exclusive. If it were possible to choose both an appetizer and a dessert, then you would need to use a different combinatorial principle, such as the rule of product, to find the total number of combinations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Consider a row of 11 seats. A child sits on each. Each child may move by at most one seat. How many possible rearrangements are there (including the original one)?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible moves each child can make. Each child has three options:

1. Stay in the original seat.
2. Move one seat to the left (except for the child in the first seat, who can&#x27;t move left).
3. Move one seat to the right (except for the child in the last seat, who can&#x27;t move right).

We can approach this problem by considering the different cases for the children at the ends of the row, as their options are limited, and then applying the rule of sum to the rest of the children.

Let&#x27;s denote the children by numbers from 1 to 11, where 1 is the child in the first seat and 11 is the child in the last seat.

Case 1: Both children 1 and 11 stay in their original seats.
- The remaining 9 children each have 3 options (stay, move left, or move right), so there are \(3^9\) arrangements for the middle children.

Case 2: Child 1 stays, and child 11 moves to the left.
- Child 10 must stay because child 11 has moved into child 10&#x27;s seat.
- The remaining 8 children (2 to 9) each have 3 options, so there are \(3^8\) arrangements for these children.

Case 3: Child 1 moves to the right, and child 11 stays.
- Child 2 must stay because child 1 has moved into child 2&#x27;s seat.
- The remaining 8 children (3 to 10) each have 3 options, so there are \(3^8\) arrangements for these children.

Case 4: Child 1 moves to the right, and child 11 moves to the left.
- Both children 2 and 10 must stay because their seats are taken by children 1 and 11, respectively.
- The remaining 7 children (3 to 9) each have 3 options, so there are \(3^7\) arrangements for these children.

Now, we can sum up the number of arrangements for each case:

Total arrangements = \(3^9 + 2 \cdot 3^8 + 3^7\)

Let&#x27;s calculate this:

\(3^9 = 19683\)
\(3^8 = 6561\)
\(3^7 = 2187\)

Total arrangements = \(19683 + 2 \cdot 6561 + 2187\)
Total arrangements = \(19683 + 13122 + 2187\)
Total arrangements = \(34992\)

So, there are 34,992 possible rearrangements of the children, including the original one.</code></pre>
