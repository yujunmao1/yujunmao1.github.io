<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach that involves breaking down the problem into cases and applying the rule of sum and the rule of product.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of strings of length \( n \) with no two 1s as neighbors by \( S(n) \). We want to find \( S(5) \).

We can start by considering the first digit of the string. It can be either 1, 2, or 3. If the first digit is 2 or 3, then the next digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3, and we don&#x27;t have any restrictions. However, if the first digit is 1, then the next digit cannot be 1.

Let&#x27;s break it down into cases based on the first digit:

1. The first digit is 1: The second digit can only be 2 or 3 (2 choices). For the remaining three digits, we essentially have a string of length 3 with no two 1s as neighbors. This is \( S(3) \).

2. The first digit is 2 or 3: There are 2 choices for the first digit. For the remaining four digits, we have a string of length 4 with no two 1s as neighbors. This is \( S(4) \).

Now we need to find \( S(3) \) and \( S(4) \) to proceed.

For \( S(3) \):
- If the first digit is 1, the second digit can be 2 or 3 (2 choices), and the third digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3 (3 choices) since it won&#x27;t be next to the first digit. So, we have \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) choices.
- If the first digit is 2 or 3, the second digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3 (3 choices), and the third digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3 (3 choices), but if the second digit is 1, the third cannot be 1. This gives us \( 2 \times (3 \times 3 - 1) = 2 \times 8 = 16 \) choices (subtracting 1 for the case where the second and third digits are both 1).

So, \( S(3) = 6 + 16 = 22 \).

For \( S(4) \):
- If the first digit is 1, the second digit can be 2 or 3 (2 choices), and the remaining two digits are a string of length 2 with no two 1s as neighbors. This is \( S(2) \).
- If the first digit is 2 or 3, the second digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3 (3 choices), and the remaining three digits are a string of length 3 with no two 1s as neighbors. This is \( S(3) \).

We need to find \( S(2) \) to proceed:
For \( S(2) \):
- If the first digit is 1, the second digit can be 2 or 3 (2 choices).
- If the first digit is 2 or 3, the second digit can be any of 1, 2, or 3 (3 choices), but if the first digit is 1, the second cannot be 1. This gives us \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) choices.

So, \( S(2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \).

Now we can find \( S(4) \):
- If the first digit is 1, we have \( 2 \times S(2) = 2 \times 8 = 16 \) choices.
- If the first digit is 2 or 3, we have \( 2 \times S(3) = 2 \times 22 = 44 \) choices.

So, \( S(4) = 16 + 44 = 60 \).

Finally, we can find \( S(5) \):
- If the first digit is 1, we have \( 2 \times S(3) = 2 \times 22 = 44 \) choices.
- If the first digit is 2 or 3, we have \( 2 \times S(4) = 2 \times 60 = 120 \) choices.

So, \( S(5) = 44 + 120 = 164 \).

Therefore, there are 164 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.</code></pre>
