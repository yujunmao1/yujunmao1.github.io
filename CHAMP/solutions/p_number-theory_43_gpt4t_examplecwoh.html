<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A number is a multiple of 3 if and only if its digit sum is divisible by 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s take the number 351 as an example.

To apply the concept, we need to find the sum of the digits of 351:

3 + 5 + 1 = 9

Now we check if the digit sum (9) is divisible by 3:

9 ÷ 3 = 3

Since 9 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, the digit sum is indeed divisible by 3. According to the concept, this means that the original number (351) should also be a multiple of 3.

To verify this, we can divide 351 by 3:

351 ÷ 3 = 117

Since 351 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, we have confirmed that 351 is a multiple of 3, which is consistent with the concept that if the digit sum of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is a multiple of 3.</code></pre>

Let a be a positive integer and p be a prime. Then a^p≡a mod p.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is known as Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). However, it can also be stated in the form you&#x27;ve given, which is \( a^p \equiv a \mod p \), and this form holds for any integer \( a \), including those divisible by \( p \).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with \( a = 4 \) and \( p = 5 \), where 5 is a prime number.

According to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, we should find that \( 4^5 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \).

Calculating \( 4^5 \):

\( 4^5 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 1024 \)

Now we check the congruence:

\( 1024 \mod 5 = 4 \)

Since the remainder when 1024 is divided by 5 is indeed 4, we have \( 1024 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), which confirms the theorem for this example.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a fundamental property of divisibility and the greatest common divisor (gcd). It states that if a positive integer \( a \) divides the product of two integers \( b \) and \( c \), and \( a \) is coprime to \( b \) (meaning that \( a \) and \( b \) have a gcd of 1), then \( a \) must divide \( c \).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example:

Let \( a = 7 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = 14 \).

First, we check that \( a | bc \):
\( bc = 6 \times 14 = 84 \),
and \( 84 \) is divisible by \( 7 \) since \( 84 \div 7 = 12 \). So, \( 7 | 84 \).

Next, we verify that \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \):
The divisors of \( 7 \) are \( 1 \) and \( 7 \), and the divisors of \( 6 \) are \( 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 6 \). The only common divisor is \( 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \).

Now, according to the concept, since \( 7 | 84 \) (where \( 84 = 6 \times 14 \)) and \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \), it must follow that \( 7 | 14 \).

Indeed, \( 14 \) is divisible by \( 7 \) since \( 14 \div 7 = 2 \). So, \( 7 | 14 \), which confirms the concept with this example.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s consider the properties of divisibility, particularly with respect to the prime number 3. Recall the concept that a number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

Let&#x27;s assume that we start with a number \( x_1 \) that is not divisible by 3. We want to know if it&#x27;s possible to only create finitely many composite numbers by appending one digit from 0 to 8 to the previous number in the sequence.

Consider the digit sum of \( x_1 \). Since \( x_1 \) is not divisible by 3, its digit sum is not divisible by 3. Now, let&#x27;s append a digit \( d \) (where \( d \) is one of the digits from 0 to 8) to \( x_1 \) to form \( x_2 \). The digit sum of \( x_2 \) will be the digit sum of \( x_1 \) plus \( d \).

Since there are only three possible remainders when dividing by 3 (0, 1, or 2), and since we are allowed to choose \( d \) from 0 to 8, we can always choose a \( d \) that makes the digit sum of \( x_2 \) divisible by 3. For example, if the digit sum of \( x_1 \) has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, we can choose \( d = 2 \) to make the digit sum of \( x_2 \) divisible by 3.

Once we have a number \( x_n \) whose digit sum is divisible by 3, \( x_n \) itself is divisible by 3, making it a composite number. For the next number \( x_{n+1} \), we can again choose a digit \( d \) that makes the digit sum of \( x_{n+1} \) divisible by 3, ensuring that \( x_{n+1} \) is also composite.

By repeating this process, we can ensure that every subsequent number in the sequence is composite by making its digit sum divisible by 3. Therefore, there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the sequence; we can always create more composite numbers by appending the right digit from 0 to 8.

In conclusion, it is not possible to have finitely many composite numbers in the sequence if we are allowed to append any digit from 0 to 8 to the previous number, because we can always choose a digit that makes the new number composite by ensuring its digit sum is divisible by 3.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>No, there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the sequence, as we can always append a digit from 0 to 8 to make the digit sum divisible by 3, thus ensuring an infinite number of composite numbers.</code></pre>
