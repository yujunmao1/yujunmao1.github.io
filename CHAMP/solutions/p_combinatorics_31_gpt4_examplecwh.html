<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example. 

Suppose you have a deck of 52 playing cards and you want to draw a hand of 5 cards. The order in which you draw the cards doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e., drawing a King first and then a Queen is the same as drawing a Queen first and then a King). 

The number of ways to choose 5 cards from 52 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from (52 cards in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (5 cards in this case). 

So, the number of different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck is C(52, 5). 

Using the formula for combinations, which is C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, we find that C(52, 5) = 52! / [5!(52-5)!] = 2,598,960. 

So, there are 2,598,960 different 5-card hands you can draw from a 52-card deck.</code></pre>

Suppose you are a coach of a basketball team with 12 players. You need to select a starting lineup of 5 players. The order in which you select the players doesn&#x27;t matter (i.e., selecting player A first and then player B is the same as selecting player B first and then player A).

The number of ways to choose 5 players from 12 is given by the combination formula C(n, r), where n is the total number of items to choose from (12 players in this case) and r is the number of items to choose (5 players in this case).

So, the number of different starting lineups you can choose from a team of 12 players is C(12, 5).

Using the formula for combinations, which is C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!] = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-r+1)/r!, we find that C(12, 5) = 12*11*10*9*8 / 5*4*3*2*1 = 792.

So, there are 792 different starting lineups you can choose from a team of 12 players.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure, let&#x27;s consider a real-life example.

Suppose you are a teacher in a class of 30 students. You want to form a committee of 5 students. The order in which you select the students doesn&#x27;t matter.

The number of ways to choose 5 students from 30 is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from (30 students in this case) and k is the number of items to choose (5 students in this case).

So, the number of different committees you can form from a class of 30 students is C(30, 5).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the other side of the equation, C(n, n-k). In this case, n-k would be 30-5=25. So, we&#x27;re looking at C(30, 25). This would be the number of ways to choose 25 students from 30 to NOT be on the committee.

According to the principle C(n, k)=C(n, n-k), these two should be equal. And indeed, they are. This is because choosing 5 students to be on the committee is the same as choosing 25 students to not be on the committee. In both cases, you&#x27;re dividing the class into two groups, one with 5 students and one with 25 students.

So, C(30, 5) = C(30, 25), and there are 142506 different ways to form a committee of 5 students from a class of 30 students, or equivalently, to choose 25 students to not be on the committee.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem can be solved using the concept of combinations with repetition, also known as multiset coefficients or combinations with replacement.

We can think of this problem as distributing 3 identical items (cookies) among 8 distinct groups (dogs). This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to place 3 indistinguishable balls into 8 distinguishable boxes.

This problem can be visualized as a row of 10 dots, where 7 dots represent the &quot;dividers&quot; between the dogs, and 3 dots represent the cookies. The position of the dividers determines which dog gets which cookie(s). For example, if all the cookies are to the left of the first divider, it means the first dog gets all the cookies.

The problem then becomes finding the number of ways to arrange these 10 dots, which is a combination problem. The number of ways to arrange n items, k of which are identical, is given by the formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!].

In this case, n = 10 (the total number of dots) and k = 3 (the number of dots that represent cookies). So the number of ways to distribute the cookies among the dogs is C(10, 3) = 10! / [3!(10-3)!] = 10*9*8 / (3*2*1) = 120.

So, there are 120 possible ways for the 8 dogs to fight over the 3 cookies.</code></pre>
