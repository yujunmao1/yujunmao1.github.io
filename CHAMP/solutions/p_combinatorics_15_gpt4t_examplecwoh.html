<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of ways to fill a 2 x 21 rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles such that the tiling is same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetry imposed by flipping the rectangle around the middle column. Since the rectangle is 2 x 21, the middle column is the 11th column from either side. The tiling pattern on the left side of this middle column must be mirrored on the right side to satisfy the condition that the tiling is the same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.

Let&#x27;s break the rectangle into three parts: the left side (10 columns), the middle column, and the right side (10 columns). The right side must be a mirror image of the left side, and the middle column can be filled independently.

First, let&#x27;s consider the middle column. There are two ways to fill it with 2 x 1 tiles: either place two tiles vertically or stack them horizontally. So, there are 2 ways to fill the middle column.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the left side of the rectangle, which has 10 columns. We need to find the number of ways to fill this with 2 x 1 tiles. Each column can be filled with either two vertical tiles or one horizontal tile. However, since the tiling must be symmetric, we only need to consider the tiling of the left side, and the right side will be determined automatically.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of ways to fill a 2 x k rectangle with f(k). For a 2 x 1 rectangle, there is only 1 way to fill it (f(1) = 1), and for a 2 x 2 rectangle, there are 2 ways to fill it (f(2) = 2). For a 2 x k rectangle, we can either place a horizontal tile in the first column (leaving a 2 x (k-2) rectangle) or place two vertical tiles in the first column (leaving a 2 x (k-1) rectangle). Therefore, we have the following recurrence relation:

f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)

We can use this recurrence to compute f(10):

f(1) = 1 (1 way: vertical)
f(2) = 2 (2 ways: 2 vertical or 2 horizontal)
f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 3 + 2 = 5
f(5) = f(4) + f(3) = 5 + 3 = 8
f(6) = f(5) + f(4) = 8 + 5 = 13
f(7) = f(6) + f(5) = 13 + 8 = 21
f(8) = f(7) + f(6) = 21 + 13 = 34
f(9) = f(8) + f(7) = 34 + 21 = 55
f(10) = f(9) + f(8) = 55 + 34 = 89

So, there are 89 ways to fill the left side of the rectangle.

Since the right side is a mirror image of the left side, we don&#x27;t need to multiply the number of ways to fill the left side by any factor for the right side. However, we do need to consider the 2 ways to fill the middle column.

Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the entire 2 x 21 rectangle with the given symmetry is:

Total ways = f(10) * ways to fill the middle column
Total ways = 89 * 2
Total ways = 178

So, there are 178 ways to fill the 2 x 21 rectangle with 2 x 1 tiles such that the tiling is the same when the rectangle is flipped around the middle column.</code></pre>
