<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. For a convex polygon of n vertices, we draw all possible diagonals and suppose that no three diagonals pass through the same point. How many such intersection points do we have in the interior of the polygon, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Every intersection point is created by two diagnoals constructed from a set of four vertex points, and every set of four vertex points creates exactly two diagonals that have exactly one intersection point.
2. Thus, the number of intersection points is the number of four-vertex-set from the n vertices, which is C(n, 4).

Problem: 2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.
Step-wise solution:
1. We can order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n), which can be done in (2n)! ways.
2. The different order of the two players within each pair (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)) result in the same pairing.
3. Thus, we need divide the number of ways by 2^n, since we have n pairs.
4. In addition, the ordering of the pairs also results in duplicate pairing, and there are n! ordering.
5. So in total, we have (2n)!/(2^n*n!) distinct pairings.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
2. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are the same person, by first selecting the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number).
3. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are different people, by first selecting the president, then the secretary, and finally the rest of the committee (of any number).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from $n$ people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) is given by the following formula:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^2$$

To see this, we can first consider the case where the president and the secretary are the same person. In this case, we can choose the committee in any of the following ways:

1. We can first choose the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number). There are $\binom{n}{k}$ ways to choose the president, and then $k^2$ ways to choose the rest of the committee.
2. We can first choose the rest of the committee (of any number), and then the president. There are $n$ ways to choose the first person in the committee, and then $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to choose the rest of the committee. This gives $n \binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to choose the committee.

The total number of ways to choose the committee in this case is therefore $\binom{n}{k} k^2 + n \binom{n-1}{k-1}$.

Now, consider the case where the president and the secretary are different people. In this case, we can choose the committee in any of the following ways:

1. We can first choose the president, then the secretary, and then the rest of the committee (of any number). There are $\binom{n}{1} \binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to choose the president and the secretary, and then $k^2$ ways to choose the rest of the committee.
2. We can first choose the rest of the committee (of any number), then the president, and then the secretary. There are $n$ ways to choose the first person in the committee, then $\binom{n-1}{k-2}$ ways to choose the rest of the committee, and then $\binom{n-2}{1}$ ways to choose the president and the secretary. This gives $n \binom{n-1}{k-2} \binom{n-2}{1}$ ways to choose the committee.

The total number of ways to choose the committee in this case is therefore $\binom{n}{1} \binom{n-1}{k-1} + n \binom{n-1}{k-2} \binom{n-2}{1}$.

Adding the number of ways to choose the committee in the two cases, we get the following formula:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^2 + n \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n}{1} \binom{n-1}{k-1} + n \binom{n-1}{k-2} \binom{n-2}{1}$$

This can be simplified to the following formula:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^2 = \binom{n}{1} \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} k + \sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-2} k^2$$

The first sum can be evaluated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-1} k = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$

The second sum can be evaluated using the formula for the sum of a square of a geometric series:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n-1}{k-2} k^2 = \frac{n(n-1)(2n-3)}{6}$$

Substituting these expressions into the formula for the sum of the first two terms, we get the following formula:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^2 = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + \frac{n(n-1)(2n-3)}{6}$$

This can be simplified to the following formula:

$$\sum_{k=1}^n \binom{n}{k} k^2 = \frac{n(n-1)(n+1)}{6}$$

This is the closed-form formula</code></pre>
