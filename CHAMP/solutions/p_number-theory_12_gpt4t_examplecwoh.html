If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all two-digit automorphic numbers besides 25.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all two-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last two digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a two-digit number \( 10x + y \), where \( x \) is the tens digit and \( y \) is the units digit. Then \( a^2 \) can be written as:

\[ (10x + y)^2 = 100x^2 + 20xy + y^2 \]

We are interested in the last two digits of \( a^2 \), which are affected by \( 20xy + y^2 \) since \( 100x^2 \) will contribute only to the higher place values beyond the last two digits.

Let&#x27;s denote \( b \) as the last two digits of \( a^2 \). Then we have:

\[ b \equiv 20xy + y^2 \mod{100} \]

Since \( b \) is the last two digits of \( a^2 \), and \( a \) is a two-digit number, \( b \) must be congruent to \( a \) modulo 100. Therefore, we have:

\[ b \equiv a \equiv 10x + y \mod{100} \]

Combining the two congruences, we get:

\[ 20xy + y^2 \equiv 10x + y \mod{100} \]

Now, let&#x27;s simplify this congruence:

\[ 20xy + y^2 - 10x - y \equiv 0 \mod{100} \]
\[ 20xy - 10x + y^2 - y \equiv 0 \mod{100} \]
\[ 10x(2y - 1) + y(y - 1) \equiv 0 \mod{100} \]

Since \( 10x(2y - 1) \) is a multiple of 10, it will always end in 0 when considered modulo 100. Therefore, the last two digits of \( a^2 \) are determined by \( y(y - 1) \). We need to find values of \( y \) such that \( y(y - 1) \) ends in \( y \) when considered modulo 100.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible values of \( y \) (the units digit of \( a \)):

- If \( y = 0 \), then \( y(y - 1) = 0 \), which ends in 0. This is not a two-digit automorphic number.
- If \( y = 1 \), then \( y(y - 1) = 0 \), which ends in 1. This is not a two-digit automorphic number.
- If \( y = 5 \), then \( y(y - 1) = 20 \), which ends in 5. This is a possibility, and we know that 25 is an automorphic number.
- If \( y = 6 \), then \( y(y - 1) = 30 \), which ends in 6. This is a possibility.

For \( y = 6 \), we have \( y(y - 1) = 6 \times 5 = 30 \), which ends in 6. This suggests that \( a \) could be a two-digit number ending in 6. Let&#x27;s check if \( a = 76 \) is automorphic:

\[ 76^2 = 5776 \]

Indeed, \( 76^2 \) ends in 76, so 76 is an automorphic number.

Now, we need to check if there are any other two-digit numbers ending in 6 that are automorphic. Since the tens digit \( x \) does not affect the last digit of \( a^2 \), we only need to consider the units digit \( y \). We have already found that 25 and 76 are automorphic numbers.

Let&#x27;s check the remaining digits for \( y \):

- If \( y = 6 \), we have already found 76.
- For \( y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 \), \( y(y - 1) \) does not end in \( y \), so they cannot be the units digit of a two-digit automorphic number.

Therefore, the only two-digit automorphic numbers are 25 and 76.</code></pre>
