If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all four-digit automorphic numbers.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the last four digit of a^2-a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all four-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last four digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a four-digit number \( abcd \) (where \( a, b, c, d \) are the digits and \( a \neq 0 \)).

Now, consider \( a^2 - a \). If \( a \) is automorphic, then \( a^2 \) ends in \( a \), and therefore \( a^2 - a \) should end in 0000. This is because subtracting \( a \) from \( a^2 \) would only affect the last four digits of \( a^2 \), turning them into zeros.

Let&#x27;s denote \( a^2 - a \) as \( N \). Since \( N \) ends in 0000, \( N \) is divisible by 10000. This means that \( a \) is a solution to the congruence:

\[ a^2 \equiv a \pmod{10000} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ a(a - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Since \( a \) and \( a - 1 \) are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, by the concept given earlier, if \( a \) divides \( a(a - 1) \), then \( a \) must divide 10000. The prime factorization of 10000 is \( 2^4 \cdot 5^4 \). Since \( a \) is a four-digit number, it can be a product of powers of 2 and 5, where the exponents sum to at most 4.

The possible values for \( a \) are then \( 2^k \cdot 5^{4-k} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Let&#x27;s calculate these values:

1. For \( k = 0 \): \( a = 5^4 = 625 \) (which is not a four-digit number, so we discard it).
2. For \( k = 1 \): \( a = 2 \cdot 5^3 = 2 \cdot 125 = 250 \) (which is not a four-digit number, so we discard it).
3. For \( k = 2 \): \( a = 2^2 \cdot 5^2 = 4 \cdot 25 = 100 \) (which is not a four-digit number, so we discard it).
4. For \( k = 3 \): \( a = 2^3 \cdot 5 = 8 \cdot 5 = 40 \) (which is not a four-digit number, so we discard it).
5. For \( k = 4 \): \( a = 2^4 = 16 \) (which is not a four-digit number, so we discard it).

It seems that the approach of directly dividing 10000 by \( a \) does not yield a four-digit number. However, we know that \( a \) must be a factor of 10000, and we need to consider the fact that \( a \) itself is a four-digit number. Let&#x27;s try a different approach.

Since \( a \) is a four-digit number, let&#x27;s write \( a \) as \( 1000x + y \), where \( x \) is the digit in the thousands place and \( y \) is the three-digit number formed by the remaining digits. Now, \( a^2 \) can be expanded as:

\[ a^2 = (1000x + y)^2 = 1000^2x^2 + 2 \cdot 1000xy + y^2 \]

We are interested in the last four digits of \( a^2 \), which are determined by \( 2 \cdot 1000xy + y^2 \) since \( 1000^2x^2 \) will contribute only zeros to the last four digits. The last four digits of \( a^2 \) are then given by the last four digits of \( 2000xy + y^2 \).

Now, since \( a \) is automorphic, the last four digits of \( a^2 \) must be \( y \) (because \( y \) is the last three digits of \( a \) and \( x \) is the thousands digit of \( a \)). This means that:

\[ 2000xy + y^2 \equiv y \pmod{10000} \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ y(2000x + y - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Since \( y \) is a three-digit number, it cannot be a factor of 10000. Therefore, the factor that must be divisible by 10000 is \( 2000x + y - 1 \). However, \( y \) is a three-digit number and \( x \) is a single digit, so \( 2000x + y \) is at most a four-digit number and cannot be a multiple of 10000. This means that our initial assumption that \( y \) is a three-digit number might be incorrect.

Let&#x27;s consider the possibility that \( y \) is a two-digit number, which means that \( a \) is of the form \( 100x + y \). Then, we have:

\[ a^2 = (100x + y)^2 = 10000x^2 + 200xy + y^2 \]

Again, we are interested in the last four digits, which are given by \( 200xy + y^2 \). For \( a \) to be automorphic, we must have:

\[ 200xy + y^2 \equiv y \pmod{10000} \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ y(200x + y - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Now, \( y \) is a two-digit number, and \( 200x \) is at most a three-digit number, so \( 200x + y \) is at most a four-digit number. This means that \( 200x + y - 1 \) could potentially be a multiple of 10000 if \( y \) is chosen appropriately.

Let&#x27;s try to find values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this condition. Since \( y \) is a two-digit number, let&#x27;s try values of \( y \) that are close to multiples of 100, as this will make \( 200x + y - 1 \) close to a multiple of 10000.

For example, if \( y = 76 \), then \( y^2 = 5776 \), which ends in 76. This suggests that \( y \) could be 76. Let&#x27;s check if this works:

\[ a = 100x + 76 \]
\[ a^2 = (100x + 76)^2 = 10000x^2 + 15200x + 5776 \]

The last four digits of \( a^2 \) are \( 15200x + 5776 \). We want these to end in 0076 for \( a \) to be automorphic. This means that:

\[ 15200x + 5776 \equiv 76 \pmod{10000} \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 15200x + 5700 \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Dividing by 100, we get:

\[ 152x + 57 \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \]

Now, we need to find a value of \( x \) such that \( 152x + 57 \) is a multiple of 100. Since \( x \) is a single digit, we can try all values from 1 to 9. After trying these values, we find that \( x = 6 \) works because:

\[ 152 \cdot 6 + 57 = 912 + 57 = 969 \]

And \( 969 \) is a multiple of 100 plus 69. This means that the last two digits of \( 15200x + 5776 \) will be 76, which is what we want.

Therefore, \( a = 100 \cdot 6 + 76 = 676 \) is an automorphic number. However, we are looking for a four-digit automorphic number, and 676 is only a three-digit number. This means we need to adjust our approach again.

Let&#x27;s go back to the original equation:

\[ a^2 \equiv a \pmod{10000} \]

This means that:

\[ a^2 - a \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as \( 1000w + x \), where \( w \) is the digit in the thousands place and \( x \) is the three-digit number formed by the remaining digits. Now, \( a^2 - a \) can be expanded as:

\[ a^2 - a = (1000w + x)^2 - (1000w + x) \]
\[ = 1000^2w^2 + 2 \cdot 1000wx + x^2 - 1000w - x \]
\[ = 1000^2w^2 + 1000(2wx - w) + (x^2 - x) \]

Since we are interested in the last four digits of \( a^2 - a \), which must be 0000 for \( a \) to be automorphic, we can focus on the term \( (x^2 - x) \). This term must be divisible by 10000 for the last four digits of \( a^2 - a \) to be 0000.

Let&#x27;s denote \( x \) as \( 100y + z \), where \( y \) is the digit in the hundreds place of \( x \), and \( z \) is the two-digit number formed by the tens and units places of \( x \). Then we have:

\[ x^2 - x = (100y + z)^2 - (100y + z) \]
\[ = 10000y^2 + 200yz + z^2 - 100y - z \]
\[ = 10000y^2 + 100(2yz - y) + (z^2 - z) \]

Again, we are interested in the last four digits, which are given by \( 100(2yz - y) + (z^2 - z) \). For \( a \) to be automorphic, we must have:

\[ 100(2yz - y) + (z^2 - z) \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ (z^2 - z) \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \]

Since \( z \) is a two-digit number, this means that \( z \) must be a solution to the congruence:

\[ z(z - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \]

This implies that \( z \) must be a multiple of 100 or one less than a multiple of 100. However, since \( z \) is a two-digit number, the only two-digit multiple of 100 is 00, and one less than a multiple of 100 is 99. Therefore, \( z \) must be either 00 or 99.

If \( z = 00 \), then \( x \) is a multiple of 100, and \( a \) is a multiple of 1000, which cannot be automorphic because the last two digits of \( a^2 \) would be 00, not matching the last two digits of \( a \).

If \( z = 99 \), then \( x \) ends in 99, and we have:

\[ x^2 - x = (100y + 99)^2 - (100y + 99) \]
\[ = 10000y^2 + 19800y + 9801 - 100y - 99 \]
\[ = 10000y^2 + 19700y + 9702 \]

For \( a \) to be automorphic, the last four digits of \( x^2 - x \) must be 0000, which means that:

\[ 19700y + 9702 \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 9700y + 9702 \equiv 0 \pmod{10000} \]

Since \( y \) is a single digit, we can try all values from 0 to 9 to find a value of \( y \) that satisfies this congruence. After trying these values, we find that \( y = 1 \) works because:

\[ 9700 \cdot 1 + 9702 = 19402 \]

And \( 19402 \) is a multiple of 10000 plus 9702. This means that the last four digits of \( 19700y + 9702 \) will be 9702, which is what we want.

Therefore, \( x = 100 \cdot 1 + 99 = 199 \), and \( a = 1000w + x \) must end in 199. Since \( a \) is a four-digit automorphic number, \( w \) must be a digit from 1 to 9 that makes \( a \) automorphic. Let&#x27;s try \( w = 1 \):

\[ a = 1000 \cdot 1 + 199 = 1199 \]
\[ a^2 = 1199^2 = 1437601 \]

The last four digits of \( 1199^2 \) are 7601, not 1199, so \( w = 1 \) does not</code></pre>
