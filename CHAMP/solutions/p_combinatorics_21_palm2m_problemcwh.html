<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select quadruple (x, y, z, u), with duplicate allowed, such that u&gt;max(x, y, z). In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For u=i, there are i-1 values of x, y and z satisfying u&gt;max(x, y, z), so we have (i-1)^3 triples of valid (x, y, z, u).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^3=sum_(i=1)^n i^3.

Problem: 2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.
Step-wise solution:
1. We can order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n), which can be done in (2n)! ways.
2. The different order of the two players within each pair (e.g., (1, 2) and (2, 1)) result in the same pairing.
3. Thus, we need divide the number of ways by 2^n, since we have n pairs.
4. In addition, the ordering of the pairs also results in duplicate pairing, and there are n! ordering.
5. So in total, we have (2n)!/(2^n*n!) distinct pairings.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select triple (x, y, z), with duplicate allowed, such that z&gt;max(x, y). In how many ways can this be done, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For z=i, there are i-1 values of x and y satisfying z&gt;max(x, y), so we have (i-1)^2 triples of valid (x, y, z).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^2=sum_(i=1)^n i^2.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. First paint a face and put it on the bottom, and then consider painting the second face on the top versus on the side.
2. If the second face is on top, how many of distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?
3. If the second face is on the side, how many distinct colorings do we have for the remaining four faces?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 6! = 720 ways to color the faces of a cube with 6 different colors. However, many of these colorings are equivalent up to rotations. For example, the colorings red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange and orange-white-yellow-green-blue-red are the same, since they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube.

To count the number of distinct colorings, we can use the following approach. First, we will count the number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors, without worrying about rotations. Then, we will divide this number by the number of ways to rotate the cube, which is 24.

The number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors is 6!. This is because there are 6 choices for the color of the first face, 5 choices for the color of the second face, and so on.

The number of ways to rotate the cube is 24. This is because the cube has 6 faces, and each face can be rotated in 4 ways.

Therefore, the number of distinct colorings of the cube is $\frac{6!}{24} = \boxed{120}$.

Here is a more detailed solution:

We can think of the coloring of a cube as a function from the set of faces of the cube to the set of colors. For example, the coloring red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange can be represented by the function $f$ such that $f(1) = \text{red}, f(2) = \text{blue}, f(3) = \text{green}, f(4) = \text{yellow}, f(5) = \text{white}, f(6) = \text{orange}$.

Two colorings are equivalent if they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube. For example, the colorings red-blue-green-yellow-white-orange and orange-white-yellow-green-blue-red are equivalent, since they can be obtained from each other by rotating the cube 90 degrees around the vertical axis.

Let $S$ be the set of all functions from the set of faces of the cube to the set of colors. Let $R$ be the relation on $S$ defined by $f R g$ if and only if $f$ and $g$ are equivalent colorings.

We want to count the number of equivalence classes of $R$.

Let $[f]$ be the equivalence class of $f$. Then $|[f]|$ is the number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors, without worrying about rotations.

To count $|[f]|$, we can use the following approach. First, we will count the number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors, without worrying about the order of the colors. Then, we will divide this number by the number of ways to permute the colors.

The number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors, without worrying about the order of the colors is $6!$. This is because there are 6 choices for the color of the first face, 5 choices for the color of the second face, and so on.

The number of ways to permute 6 objects is $6!$.

Therefore, the number of ways to color the faces of the cube with 6 different colors, without worrying about rotations is $\frac{6!}{6!} = 1$.

Therefore, the number of equivalence classes of $R$ is $|S| = 1$.

Therefore, the number of distinct colorings of the cube is $\frac{|S|}{|R|} = \frac{1}{1} = \boxed{120}$.</code></pre>
