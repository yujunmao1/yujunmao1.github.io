<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of either event A or event B occurring is 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1.

The rule of sum can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of rolling a 6 on a die, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails, or the probability of getting a certain letter on a die.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of sum is only valid if the events are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. For example, the event of rolling a 6 on a die and the event of rolling a 1 on a die are mutually exclusive.

If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is not equal to the sum of the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails. This is because the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is affected by the fact that the coin can land on its edge.

The rule of sum is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, 1 choice for the third digit, and 1 choice for the fourth digit. The fifth digit can be any of the 3 digits, so there are $3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1 \times 3 = 18$ possible strings.

However, some of these strings have 1s that are neighbors. For example, the string 12133 is a valid string, but it has 1s that are neighbors. To count the number of strings with no 1s that are neighbors, we need to subtract the number of strings with 1s that are neighbors from the total number of strings.

There are 3 ways to choose the first digit of a string with 1s that are neighbors. For example, we could choose 12133. Once we have chosen the first digit, there are 2 ways to choose the second digit. For example, if we chose 12133, we could choose 2 for the second digit. Once we have chosen the first two digits, there is only 1 way to choose the third digit. For example, if we chose 12133, we would have to choose 3 for the third digit. Once we have chosen the first three digits, there are 2 ways to choose the fourth digit. For example, if we chose 12133, we could choose 2 or 3 for the fourth digit. Once we have chosen the first four digits, there is only 1 way to choose the fifth digit. For example, if we chose 12133, we would have to choose 1 for the fifth digit. So, there are $3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 12$ strings with 1s that are neighbors.

Therefore, the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors is $18 - 12 = 6$.</code></pre>
