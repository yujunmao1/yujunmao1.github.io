Suppose you want to paint a room. There are three steps: (1) choose a color, (2) buy the paint, and (3) paint the room. There are 100 different colors to choose from, 5 different stores to buy the paint from, and 10 different ways to paint the room. So, there are $100 \times 5 \times 10 = 5000$ ways to paint the room.

Here is another example. Suppose you want to make a sandwich. There are four steps: (1) choose the bread, (2) choose the filling, (3) choose the condiments, and (4) assemble the sandwich. There are 3 different types of bread, 5 different fillings, 2 different condiments, and 10 different ways to assemble the sandwich. So, there are $3 \times 5 \times 2 \times 10 = 300$ ways to make a sandwich.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If we count each object d times and get a total of n counts, then there are n/d objects.

Suppose you have a box of 12 eggs. You count the eggs once and get a total of 12 counts. This means that you have counted each egg once. If you count the eggs again, you will get a total of 24 counts. This means that you have counted each egg twice. If you count the eggs a third time, you will get a total of 36 counts. This means that you have counted each egg three times. And so on.

In general, if you count each object d times, you will get a total of n counts, where n is the number of objects. So, if you have n objects and you count each object d times, you will get a total of n*d counts.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

2n players are participating in a tennis tournament. Find the number of ways that n pairs can be constructed for the first round, as an expression of n.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Order the 2n players in a row, and make the pairing (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6), ..., (2n-1, 2n). In how many ways can this be done?
2. There are two types of multiple counting, one is the order within each pair, such as (1, 2) and (2, 1), and the second is ordering of the pairs, such as [(1, 2), (3, 4)] and [(3, 4), (1, 2)].</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are $2n$ players, and we want to divide them into $n$ pairs. We can do this by first ordering the players in a row, and then pairing them up in order. There are $2n!$ ways to order the players, but we need to divide by $2$ because the order of the pairs doesn&#x27;t matter, and we need to divide by $n!$ because the order of the players within each pair doesn&#x27;t matter. So, the number of ways to divide the players into $n$ pairs is:

$$\frac{2n!}{2n!n!} = \binom{2n}{n}$$

Here is a more detailed explanation of the solution.

We can divide the problem into two steps:

1. Order the 2n players in a row.
2. Pair up the players in order.

The first step can be done in $2n!$ ways. The second step can be done in $n!$ ways, because there are $n!$ ways to choose the first player in each pair, and then $n!$ ways to choose the second player in each pair.

However, we need to be careful not to overcount. For example, the pairings (1, 2) and (2, 1) are the same pairing, so we only want to count them once. We can do this by dividing by $2$, which is the number of ways to order the pairs.

We also need to be careful not to overcount the order of the players within each pair. For example, the pairings (1, 2) and (2, 1) are the same pairing, so we only want to count them once. We can do this by dividing by $n!$, which is the number of ways to order the players within each pair.

So, the number of ways to divide the players into $n$ pairs is:

$$\frac{2n!}{2n!n!} = \binom{2n}{n}$$</code></pre>
