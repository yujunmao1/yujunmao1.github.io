<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r ≠ 1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For a≤b, define the sequence as a_1=a, a_2=b, a_(n+2)=(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2. Does the limit exist for this sequence, and if so, find it as an expression in terms of a and b.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study the relationship between |a_(n+2)-a_(n+1)| and |a_(n+1)-a_n|.
2. If an (infinite) sequence converges to a limit, then all (infinite) subsequences converge, and converge to the same limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s analyze the given sequence:

a_1 = a,
a_2 = b,
a_(n+2) = (a_(n+1) + a_n) / 2.

We want to determine if the sequence converges and, if so, find the limit in terms of a and b.

First, let&#x27;s look at the relationship between |a_(n+2) - a_(n+1)| and |a_(n+1) - a_n|:

|a_(n+2) - a_(n+1)| = |(a_(n+1) + a_n)/2 - a_(n+1)| = |a_n/2 - a_(n+1)/2| = |(a_n - a_(n+1))/2| = 1/2 * |a_n - a_(n+1)|.

This shows that the absolute difference between successive terms is halved with each step. This suggests that the sequence is Cauchy, meaning that the terms are getting closer together as n increases. A Cauchy sequence in a complete space (like the real numbers) is guaranteed to converge.

Now, let&#x27;s assume the sequence converges to a limit L. Then, as n approaches infinity, both a_n and a_(n+1) approach L. We can use the recursive formula to find L:

L = (L + L) / 2,
2L = L + L,
2L = 2L.

This equation is true for any L, so it doesn&#x27;t give us the value of L directly. However, we can use the fact that if a sequence converges, all its subsequences also converge to the same limit.

Let&#x27;s consider the subsequences of even and odd indices. Since the sequence is defined recursively, the odd and even terms are updated based on the previous terms. As n becomes large, the difference between a_n and a_(n+1) becomes negligible, and both subsequences will approach the same limit L.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the first few terms to get an idea of the behavior of the sequence:

a_1 = a,
a_2 = b,
a_3 = (a + b) / 2,
a_4 = (b + (a + b) / 2) / 2 = (2b + a + b) / 4 = (a + 3b) / 4,
a_5 = ((a + b) / 2 + (a + 3b) / 4) / 2 = (2a + 2b + a + 3b) / 8 = (3a + 5b) / 8.

We can see that the terms are becoming averages of a and b, with the weights of a and b becoming increasingly balanced as n increases. This suggests that the limit L should be some sort of average of a and b.

Since the sequence is bounded (by a and b) and the differences between terms are decreasing, we can conclude that the sequence is convergent. The limit L must be the value that satisfies the condition of the sequence for large n, which is the average of the two previous terms.

Therefore, the limit L of the sequence is the average of a and b:

L = (a + b) / 2.

This is the value to which the sequence converges.</code></pre>
