<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the formula for the sum of a geometric series. A geometric series is a series of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). The formula you&#x27;ve provided gives the sum of the first n+1 terms of a geometric series (finite geometric series) and the sum of an infinite geometric series, respectively.

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example:

Suppose we have a geometric series where the first term (a) is 3 and the common ratio (r) is 1/2. We want to find the sum of the first 5 terms and the sum of the series as it goes to infinity.

First, let&#x27;s find the sum of the first 5 terms (n=4, because we start counting from n=0):

a + a*r + a*r^2 + a*r^3 + a*r^4 = a(1 - r^(n+1)) / (1 - r)

Plugging in the values we have:

3 + 3*(1/2) + 3*(1/2)^2 + 3*(1/2)^3 + 3*(1/2)^4 = 3(1 - (1/2)^(4+1)) / (1 - 1/2)

Now, calculate the right side:

= 3(1 - (1/2)^5) / (1 - 1/2)
= 3(1 - 1/32) / (1/2)
= 3(31/32) / (1/2)
= 3 * 31/32 * 2/1
= 93/16
= 5.8125

So, the sum of the first 5 terms of the series is 5.8125.

Now, let&#x27;s find the sum of the series as it goes to infinity. This is possible because the common ratio is between -1 and 1 (|r| &lt; 1), which means the terms get smaller and smaller, allowing the series to converge to a finite sum.

a + a*r + a*r^2 + ... = a / (1 - r)

Again, plugging in the values we have:

3 + 3*(1/2) + 3*(1/2)^2 + ... = 3 / (1 - 1/2)

Calculate the right side:

= 3 / (1/2)
= 3 * 2/1
= 6

So, the sum of the series to infinity is 6.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Is it possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... such that the sum is 1/5, and if so, what is the sequence?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Assume that the geometric sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a ratio of 1/2^b.
2. Consider separately the cases of a=b, a&lt;b, a&gt;b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find an infinite geometric sequence within the given sequence 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, ... that sums up to 1/5. We are told to assume that the sequence starts with 1/2^a and has a common ratio of 1/2^b.

The sum of an infinite geometric series with the first term a and common ratio r (|r| &lt; 1) is given by S = a / (1 - r).

In our case, the first term is 1/2^a and the common ratio is 1/2^b, so the sum S of the infinite sequence is:

S = (1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b)

We want this sum to be 1/5:

(1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b) = 1/5

Now, let&#x27;s consider the three cases separately:

1. Case a = b:
In this case, the common ratio r is 1/2^a. Plugging this into the sum formula:

(1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^a) = 1/5

This equation simplifies to:

5 = 2^a - 1

This equation does not have an integer solution for a, because 2^a is always an even number and subtracting 1 from it will always yield an odd number, which cannot equal 5. Therefore, there is no solution in the case where a = b.

2. Case a &lt; b:
In this case, the common ratio r is smaller than the first term. Let&#x27;s plug in the values:

(1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b) = 1/5

Cross-multiplying gives us:

5 = 2^a * (2^b - 1)

Since a &lt; b, the right side of the equation is an integer times an odd number, which cannot equal 5 because 5 is a prime number. Therefore, there is no solution in the case where a &lt; b.

3. Case a &gt; b:
In this case, the common ratio r is larger than the first term. Let&#x27;s plug in the values:

(1/2^a) / (1 - 1/2^b) = 1/5

Cross-multiplying gives us:

5 = 2^a / (1 - 1/2^b)

Multiplying both sides by (1 - 1/2^b) gives us:

5 * (1 - 1/2^b) = 2^a

Expanding the left side:

5 - 5/2^b = 2^a

Now, let&#x27;s try to find integer values for a and b that satisfy this equation. Since a &gt; b, we can start with b = 1 and increment b until we find a solution:

For b = 1:
5 - 5/2 = 2^a
5 - 2.5 = 2^a
2.5 = 2^a
This does not yield an integer solution for a.

For b = 2:
5 - 5/4 = 2^a
5 - 1.25 = 2^a
3.75 = 2^a
This does not yield an integer solution for a.

For b = 3:
5 - 5/8 = 2^a
5 - 0.625 = 2^a
4.375 = 2^a
This does not yield an integer solution for a.

For b = 4:
5 - 5/16 = 2^a
5 - 0.3125 = 2^a
4.6875 = 2^a
This does not yield an integer solution for a.

However, we notice that as b increases, the term 5/2^b becomes smaller and smaller. Since 5 is not a power of 2, we will never find an integer a such that 5 - 5/2^b equals 2^a. Therefore, there is no solution in the case where a &gt; b.

In conclusion, it is not possible to select an infinite geometric sequence from the given sequence such that the sum is 1/5.</code></pre>
