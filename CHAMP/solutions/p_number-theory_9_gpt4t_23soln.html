<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation x^2+y^2+z^2=2xyz.

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We choose k to be the maximum value such that 2^k divides x, y, z at the same time, and write x=2^k*u, y=2^k*v, z=2^k*w.
2. Thus, u, v, w cannot be all even (otherwise k can be chosen to be k+1).
3. Substituting these values into the equation, we have 2^(2k)*(u^2+v^2+w^2)=2^(3k+1)*uvw.
4. u^2+v^2+w^2=2^(k+1)*uvw.
5. Since the right hand side is even, and u,v,w cannot be all even, we must have two of u,v,w being odd and one being even.
6. Without loss of generality, let u be even and v, w be odd.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Continuing from where the partial solution left off:

6. Without loss of generality, let u be even and v, w be odd.

Since v and w are odd, their squares v^2 and w^2 are also odd. The sum of two odd numbers is even, so v^2 + w^2 is even. Since u is even, u^2 is also even. Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation u^2 + v^2 + w^2 is the sum of three even numbers, which is even.

Now, we have the equation:

u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 2^(k+1) * uvw

Since the left-hand side is even, the right-hand side must also be even, which is consistent with what we have.

7. We can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to get:

(u^2 + v^2 + w^2) / 2 = 2^k * uvw

8. Since u is even, let u = 2t for some integer t. Substituting this into the equation gives:

(4t^2 + v^2 + w^2) / 2 = 2^k * 2tvw

Simplifying, we get:

2t^2 + (v^2 + w^2) / 2 = 2^(k-1) * 2tvw

9. Since v and w are odd, (v^2 + w^2) / 2 is an integer. Let&#x27;s call it m. So we have:

2t^2 + m = 2^(k-1) * 2tvw

10. Now, we can see that m must be even because it is equal to 2t^2 + 2^(k-1) * 2tvw - 2t^2, which is clearly even. Since m is even and it is the sum of two odd squares divided by 2, it implies that v^2 and w^2 must be congruent to 1 modulo 4. Therefore, v and w must be of the form 4n + 1 or 4n + 3 for some integer n.

11. Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

t^2 + m/2 = 2^(k-2) * tvw

12. Since t, v, and w are integers, and m/2 is an integer (because m is even), this equation implies that t divides m/2. Let&#x27;s say m/2 = tl for some integer l. Then we have:

t^2 + tl = 2^(k-2) * tvw

13. Dividing through by t gives:

t + l = 2^(k-2) * vw

14. Since t and l are integers, this implies that vw must be a divisor of t + l. However, we know that v and w are odd, so vw is odd, and thus 2^(k-2) must be a power of 2 that divides t + l.

15. If k &gt; 2, then 2^(k-2) is at least 4, which means that t + l must be divisible by 4. However, since v and w are odd, vw is odd, and thus t + l must be odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, k must be 2 or less.

16. If k = 2, then the equation becomes:

t + l = vw

But since t divides m/2, which is l, t must also divide vw. This implies that t is a common divisor of l and vw.

17. If k = 1, then the equation becomes:

t + l = 2vw

But this would imply that t + l is even, which is a contradiction since vw is odd and thus t + l must be odd.

18. If k = 0, then the equation becomes:

t + l = vw / 2

But since vw is odd, vw / 2 is not an integer, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the only possible value for k is 2, which gives us the equation:

t + l = vw

Now, we need to find the positive integer solutions for t, v, and w that satisfy this equation. Since t divides l, let&#x27;s say l = ht for some integer h. Then we have:

t + ht = vw

Or:

t(1 + h) = vw

This implies that t is a common divisor of vw and 1 + h. Since v and w are odd and relatively prime (otherwise, we could increase k), t must be 1. This gives us:

1 + h = vw

Since v and w are odd, h must be even. Let&#x27;s say h = 2n for some integer n. Then we have:

1 + 2n = vw

This implies that v and w are consecutive odd integers, where v is the smaller one. The only pair of consecutive odd integers whose product is one more than an even number is 1 and 3. Therefore, v = 1 and w = 3.

Substituting back into the original variables, we have:

x = 2^k * u = 2^2 * 2t = 4 * 2 = 8
y = 2^k * v = 4 * 1 = 4
z = 2^k * w = 4 * 3 = 12

So the only positive integer solution to the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2xyz is (x, y, z) = (8, 4, 12).</code></pre>
