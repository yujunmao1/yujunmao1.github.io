<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer-valued solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 5?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Consider the equation modulo 5.
2. An even perfect square is divisible by 4.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will consider the given equation modulo 5 and use the fact that an even perfect square is divisible by 4.

The equation is:
x^2 + y^2 = z^2

First, let&#x27;s consider the possible remainders when a number is squared and then reduced modulo 5. The remainders can only be 0, 1, or 4 because:

- If a number is divisible by 5, its square is also divisible by 5, and the remainder is 0.
- If a number has a remainder of 1 or 4 when divided by 5, its square will also have a remainder of 1 or 4, respectively, because (±1)^2 = 1 and (±2)^2 = 4 modulo 5.
- If a number has a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 5, its square will have a remainder of 4 or 1, respectively, because (±2)^2 = 4 and (±3)^2 = 9 ≡ 4 modulo 5.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 modulo 5. We have three cases for x and y:

1. Both x and y are divisible by 5:
   In this case, x^2 and y^2 are both divisible by 5, so their sum is also divisible by 5. Therefore, z^2 must be divisible by 5, and hence z is divisible by 5.

2. One of x or y is divisible by 5, and the other is not:
   Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s say x is divisible by 5 and y is not. Then x^2 is divisible by 5, but y^2 is not, so it has a remainder of 1 or 4 when divided by 5. The sum x^2 + y^2 will have a remainder of 1 or 4 modulo 5, which means z^2 must also have a remainder of 1 or 4 modulo 5. However, this is not possible because z^2 must be divisible by 5 to satisfy the equation. Therefore, this case cannot occur.

3. Neither x nor y is divisible by 5:
   In this case, x^2 and y^2 have remainders of 1 or 4 modulo 5. The only way their sum can be divisible by 5 (which is necessary for z^2 to be divisible by 5) is if one of them has a remainder of 1 and the other has a remainder of 4. This would make the sum x^2 + y^2 have a remainder of 0 modulo 5, which means z^2 is divisible by 5, and hence z is divisible by 5.

From the above cases, we can conclude that at least one of the numbers x, y, or z must be divisible by 5. However, we can also see that if either x or y is divisible by 5, then z must also be divisible by 5. Therefore, at least one and possibly two of the numbers must be divisible by 5.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the second piece of information: an even perfect square is divisible by 4. This information is not directly relevant to the question of divisibility by 5, but it does tell us something about the parity of x, y, and z. If x or y were even, then x^2 or y^2 would be divisible by 4, and if z were even, then z^2 would be divisible by 4. However, this does not affect the conclusion we reached regarding divisibility by 5.

In conclusion, at least one of the numbers x, y, or z must be divisible by 5 in any integer-valued solution to the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2.</code></pre>
