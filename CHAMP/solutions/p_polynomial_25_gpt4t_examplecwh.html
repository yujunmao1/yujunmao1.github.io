If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a fundamental property of divisibility in the context of integers. The notation &quot;d | a&quot; means &quot;d divides a,&quot; which implies that there is some integer k such that a = kd.

Let&#x27;s take a concrete example. Suppose we have d = 4, a = 12, and b = 8. We can see that:

- d | a because 12 = 4 * 3, so a is divisible by 4.
- d | b because 8 = 4 * 2, so b is also divisible by 4.

Now, let&#x27;s verify the property for different combinations of a and b:

1. d | ax + by for some integers x and y:
Let&#x27;s choose x = 2 and y = 3. Then we have ax + by = (12 * 2) + (8 * 3) = 24 + 24 = 48. Since 48 = 4 * 12, we can see that d | ax + by.

2. d | a + b:
We have a + b = 12 + 8 = 20. Since 20 = 4 * 5, it follows that d | a + b.

3. d | a - b:
We have a - b = 12 - 8 = 4. Since 4 = 4 * 1, it is clear that d | a - b.

In each case, the sum or difference is divisible by d, which is consistent with the property of divisibility you&#x27;ve described. This property is very useful in number theory and is a direct consequence of the definition of divisibility and the distributive property of multiplication over addition and subtraction.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For how many values of n in {2, 3, 4, ..., 1993} can f(x)=x^n+5x^(n−1)+3 be written as g(x)h(x) where g(x) and h(x) are both polynomials of integer coefficients with degree at least 1?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(x)=a_n*x^n+a_(n-1)*x^(n-1)+...+a_0, g(x)=b_m*x^m+b_(m-1)*x^(m-1)+...+b_0, h(x)=c_(n-m)*x^(n-m)+c_(n-m-1)*x^(n-m-1)+...+c_0, and find the values of a_i.
2. Assume that |b_0|=3, let i be the smallest i such that 3 ∤ b_i, and find the expression on this a_i and its divisibility by 3.
3. Find the condition on i and study f(x)=g(x)h(x) at x=±1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to determine for how many values of \( n \) the polynomial \( f(x) = x^n + 5x^{n-1} + 3 \) can be factored into two polynomials \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) with integer coefficients and degrees at least 1.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the given polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = x^n + 5x^{n-1} + 3 \]

We are looking for a factorization of \( f(x) \) into two polynomials \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) with integer coefficients:

\[ f(x) = g(x)h(x) \]

Given that \( |b_0| = 3 \), we can assume without loss of generality that \( b_0 = 3 \) or \( b_0 = -3 \) (since the sign can be absorbed into \( h(x) \)). Let&#x27;s assume \( b_0 = 3 \) for simplicity; the argument will be similar if \( b_0 = -3 \).

Now, let \( i \) be the smallest index such that \( 3 \nmid b_i \). This means that all coefficients \( b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{i-1} \) are divisible by 3, and \( b_i \) is the first coefficient that is not divisible by 3.

The coefficient \( a_i \) in the expansion of \( g(x)h(x) \) will be a sum of products of the form \( b_jc_{i-j} \), where \( j \) ranges from 0 to \( i \). Since \( b_0, b_1, \ldots, b_{i-1} \) are all divisible by 3, and \( c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{i-j} \) are integers, all terms in the sum for \( a_i \) will be divisible by 3 except possibly the term \( b_ic_0 \). Therefore, \( a_i \) will not be divisible by 3 if and only if \( b_ic_0 \) is not divisible by 3.

Since \( b_i \) is not divisible by 3 by our choice of \( i \), and \( c_0 \) is an integer, the only way for \( a_i \) to be divisible by 3 is if \( c_0 \) is also divisible by 3. However, if \( c_0 \) is divisible by 3, then \( h(x) \) would have all coefficients divisible by 3, which would mean that \( f(x) \) has all coefficients divisible by 3, which is not the case since the constant term is 3.

Therefore, \( c_0 \) cannot be divisible by 3, and thus \( a_i \) is not divisible by 3. This means that \( f(x) \) cannot be factored into two polynomials with integer coefficients unless \( a_i \) corresponds to a coefficient that is not present in \( f(x) \), which happens when \( i \geq n \).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the values of \( x \) at \( x = \pm 1 \):

For \( x = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1^n + 5 \cdot 1^{n-1} + 3 = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.

For \( x = -1 \), \( f(-1) = (-1)^n + 5 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} + 3 \). This expression will be divisible by 3 if and only if \( n \) is even, because if \( n \) is odd, \( (-1)^n + 5 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} = -1 - 5 = -6 + 3 = -3 \), which is divisible by 3, but if \( n \) is even, \( (-1)^n + 5 \cdot (-1)^{n-1} = 1 - 5 = -4 + 3 = -1 \), which is not divisible by 3.

Therefore, for \( f(x) \) to be factorable into \( g(x)h(x) \) with integer coefficients, \( n \) must be even. Since \( n \) ranges from 2 to 1993, the number of even values of \( n \) is half of the total number of values, which is \( \frac{1993 - 2 + 1}{2} = \frac{1992}{2} = 996 \).

So, there are 996 values of \( n \) for which \( f(x) \) can be written as \( g(x)h(x) \) where \( g(x) \) and \( h(x) \) are both polynomials with integer coefficients and degrees at least 1.</code></pre>
