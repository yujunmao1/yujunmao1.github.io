In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Let H(n, r) represent the number of ways that n horses can finish in r groups (where horses in each group are tied).
2. We have H(n, 1)=1 for all n, since there is only one way that all groups are tied.
3. To calculate H(n, r), we add a new horse to the race result of n-1 horses.
4. The new horse can be in its own finishing group, in which case we require that there are r-1 finishing groups originally.
5. For each race result in H(n-1, r-1), the new horse can be inserted into one of r slots (first, in between two groups and last), so we have H(n-1, r-1)*r groups.
6. The new horse can also be in a tied position, in which case we require that there are r finishing groups originally.
7. For each race result in H(n-1, r), the new horse can be tied in one of r groups, so we have H(n-1, r)*r groups.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we can use the recursive formula derived in the partial solution.

Let&#x27;s calculate H(4, 1), which represents the number of ways that 4 horses can finish in 1 group (with ties).

Using step 2 of the partial solution, we know that H(n, 1) = 1 for all n. Therefore, H(4, 1) = 1.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate H(4, 2), which represents the number of ways that 4 horses can finish in 2 groups (with ties).

Using step 3 of the partial solution, we add a new horse to the race result of 3 horses. This new horse can be in its own finishing group (step 4) or in a tied position (step 6).

If the new horse is in its own finishing group, we require that there are 2 finishing groups originally (r-1). Therefore, we need to calculate H(3, 1).

Using step 2, we know that H(n, 1) = 1 for all n. Therefore, H(3, 1) = 1.

For each race result in H(3, 1), the new horse can be inserted into one of 2 slots (step 5). So, we have H(3, 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2 groups.

If the new horse is in a tied position, we require that there are 2 finishing groups originally (r). Therefore, we need to calculate H(3, 2).

Using step 3, we add a new horse to the race result of 2 horses. This new horse can be in its own finishing group (step 4) or in a tied position (step 6).

If the new horse is in its own finishing group, we require that there are 1 finishing group originally (r-1). Therefore, we need to calculate H(2, 1).

Using step 2, we know that H(n, 1) = 1 for all n. Therefore, H(2, 1) = 1.

For each race result in H(2, 1), the new horse can be inserted into one of 2 slots (step 5). So, we have H(2, 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2 groups.

If the new horse is in a tied position, we require that there are 2 finishing groups originally (r). Therefore, we need to calculate H(2, 2).

Using step 2, we know that H(n, 1) = 1 for all n. Therefore, H(2, 2) = 1.

For each race result in H(2, 2), the new horse can be tied in one of 2 groups (step 7). So, we have H(2, 2) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2 groups.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate H(3, 2) using the results we obtained above.

For each race result in H(3, 1), the new horse can be inserted into one of 2 slots (step 5). So, we have H(3, 1) * 2 = 1 * 2 = 2 groups.

For each race result in H(3, 2), the new horse can be tied in one of 2 groups (step 7). So, we have H(3, 2) * 2 = 2 * 2 = 4 groups.

Therefore, H(4, 2) = H(3, 1) * 2 + H(3, 2) * 2 = 2 + 4 = 6.

Finally, let&#x27;s calculate H(4, 3), which represents the number of ways that 4 horses can finish in 3 groups (with ties).

Using step 3, we add a new horse to the race result of 3 horses. This new horse can be in its own finishing group (step 4) or in a tied position (step 6).

If the new horse is in its own finishing group, we require that there are 2 finishing groups originally (r-1). Therefore, we need to calculate H(3, 2).

Using the results we obtained above, we know that H(3, 2) = 6.

For each race result in H(3, 2), the new horse can be inserted into one of 3 slots (step 5). So, we have H(3, 2) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18 groups.

If the new horse is in a tied position, we require that there are 3 finishing groups originally (r). Therefore, we need to calculate H(3, 3).

Using step 2, we know that H(n, 1) = 1 for all n. Therefore, H(3, 3) = 1.

For each race result in H(3, 3), the new horse can be tied in one of 3 groups (step 7). So, we have H(3, 3) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 groups.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate H(4, 3) using the results we obtained above.

For each race result in H(3, 2), the new horse can be inserted into one of 3 slots (step 5). So, we have H(3, 2) * 3 = 6 * 3 = 18 groups.

For each race result in H(3, 3), the new horse can be tied in one of 3 groups (step 7). So, we have H(3, 3) * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 groups.

Therefore, H(4, 3) = H(3, 2) * 3 + H(3, 3) * 3 = 18 + 3 = 21.

In conclusion, there are 1 way for 4 horses to finish in 1 group, 6 ways for 4 horses to finish in 2 groups, and 21 ways for 4 horses to finish in 3 groups.</code></pre>
