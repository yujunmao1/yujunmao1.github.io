<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: If n is a composite number, find all possible values of 1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1) mod 1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1).
Step-wise solution:
1. We have Q(n)=1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1)/(1+2+...+(n-1))=1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1)/(n(n-1)/2)=2*2*3*...*(n-2)/n.
2. Since n is composite, we let n=pq, where 1&lt;p≤q&lt;n.
3. We further have q&lt;n-1 since gcd(n,n-1)=1.
4. Thus, if p≠q, then p,q are two factors less than n-1 and thus separately appear among the terms of 2*3*...*(n-2).
5. If p=q, when p=q=2, we have n=4 and Q(n)=2*2/4=1.
6. For p=q≥3, then n-2=q^2-2&gt;2q.
7. Thus, factors p and 2q appear among the terms of 2*3*...*(n-2).
8. So in all cases, we have Q(n) as a whole integer.
9. Thus, 1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1) mod 1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1)=0.

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 1971=27*73, we need 27 | 50^n+23^n*a and 73 | 50^n+23^n*a.
2. We have 50^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n*(a+1) mod 27=0.
3. In addition, for odd n, we have 50^n+23^n*a mod 73=(-23)^n+23^n*a mod 73=23^n*(a-1) mod 73=0.
4. Since gcd(27, 23)=gcd(73, 23)=1, we must have gcd(27, 23^n)=gcd(73, 23^n)=1, so 27 | a+1 and 73 | a-1.
5. In other words, a mod 27=-1 and a mod 73=1.
6. Thus, a=27x-1=73y+1 and 27 | 73y+2.
7. We have 73 mod 27=19, so the sequence of 73y+2 mod 27, starting for y=1, 2, 3, ... is 21, 13, 5, 24, 16, 8, 0.
8. We have 27 | 73y+2 for y=7, and a=73y+2=512.
9. Thus, a=512.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The terms of the sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... are all positive, and a_(n+1)=sqrt(1+a_n) for all n. Does there exist such a sequence with all a_n being rational numbers, and if so, find the smallest possible value of a_1 such that the sequence satisfies the condition.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Assume that each a_n is rational and write a_n=p_n/q_n with gcd(p_n, q_n)=1.
2. From a_(n+1)^2=1+a_n, study the relationship between q_n and q_(n+1).
3. Establish a stronger condition on the sequence of numbers.
4. Study possible valid values for a_1 under this stronger condition by looking at the expression a_(n+1)^2-a_n^2.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will follow the steps outlined and use the additional information provided.

Step 1: Assume that each \( a_n \) is rational and write \( a_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n} \) with \( \gcd(p_n, q_n) = 1 \).

Step 2: From the recursive definition \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we have \( a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + a_n \). Substituting \( a_n = \frac{p_n}{q_n} \), we get:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + \frac{p_n}{q_n} = \frac{p_n + q_n}{q_n} \]

Step 3: Since \( a_{n+1} \) is also rational, we can write \( a_{n+1} = \frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}} \) with \( \gcd(p_{n+1}, q_{n+1}) = 1 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ \left(\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}\right)^2 = \frac{p_n + q_n}{q_n} \]

This implies that \( q_{n+1}^2 \) must divide \( q_n \) (since the left side is in lowest terms and the right side must also be in lowest terms for the equality to hold).

Step 4: We need to establish a stronger condition on the sequence of numbers. Since \( q_{n+1}^2 \) divides \( q_n \), and \( q_n \) divides \( q_{n-1} \), and so on, we must have \( q_1 \) dividing all subsequent \( q_n \). This implies that \( q_1 \) must be a perfect square, say \( q_1 = k^2 \), to ensure that all subsequent \( q_n \) are also perfect squares.

Step 5: Now, let&#x27;s look at the expression \( a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 \) to find possible valid values for \( a_1 \):

\[ a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = \left(\frac{p_{n+1}}{q_{n+1}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{p_n}{q_n}\right)^2 = \frac{p_n + q_n}{q_n} - \frac{p_n}{q_n} = \frac{q_n}{q_n} = 1 \]

This means that \( a_{n+1}^2 - a_n^2 = 1 \) for all \( n \). Since \( a_1 \) is the smallest value in the sequence and \( a_1 \) must be rational, let&#x27;s try the smallest non-trivial rational square, which is \( \frac{1}{1} = 1 \). If \( a_1 = 1 \), then \( a_2 = \sqrt{1 + 1} = \sqrt{2} \), which is not rational.

Therefore, \( a_1 \) cannot be 1. We need to find the smallest rational square greater than 1. The next smallest rational square is \( \frac{4}{1} = 4 \). Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = 4 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \]

This is not rational either. The next smallest rational square is \( \frac{9}{1} = 9 \). Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = 9 \):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} \]

This is also not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{49}{1} = 49 \), we get:

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + 49} = \sqrt{50} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{1} \]

This is not rational either, but if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{49}{4} \), we get:

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{49}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{53}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{53}}{2} \]

This is not rational. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that \( a_1 + 1 \) is a perfect square and \( a_1 \) is a perfect square over a perfect square (i.e., \( a_1 = \frac{k^2}{l^2} \) where \( k^2 \) and \( l^2 \) are perfect squares).

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 4 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{1}{16} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 16 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{17}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{4} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{25}{16} \) (since \( 25 \) and \( 16 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{25}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{41}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{41}}{4} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{25}{36} \) (since \( 25 \) and \( 36 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{25}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{61}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{61}}{6} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{36}{25} \) (since \( 36 \) and \( 25 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{36}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{61}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{61}}{5} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{49}{36} \) (since \( 49 \) and \( 36 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{49}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{85}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{85}}{6} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{16}{9} \) (since \( 16 \) and \( 9 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{16}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{9}} = \frac{5}{3} \]

This is rational. Now, let&#x27;s check if the sequence can continue with rational numbers:

\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{5}{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \]

This is not rational. Therefore, \( a_1 = \frac{16}{9} \) does not work. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square, and this property continues for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{4}{1} \) (since \( 4 \) and \( 1 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{1}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{1}} = \sqrt{5} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{4}{9} \) (since \( 4 \) and \( 9 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{4}{9}} = \sqrt{\frac{13}{9}} = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square, and this property continues for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 4 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{1}{1} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 1 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{1}} = \sqrt{2} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square, and this property continues for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{1}{16} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 16 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{17}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{17}}{4} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{1}{25} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 25 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{26}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{26}}{5} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square, and this property continues for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{1}{36} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 36 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{36}} = \sqrt{\frac{37}{36}} = \frac{\sqrt{37}}{6} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{1}{49} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 49 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{49}} = \sqrt{\frac{50}{49}} = \frac{\sqrt{50}}{7} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{7} \]

This is not rational either. We need to find a value of \( a_1 \) such that both \( a_1 \) and \( a_1 + 1 \) are perfect squares over perfect squares, and the square root of \( a_1 + 1 \) is also a perfect square over a perfect square, and this property continues for all subsequent terms.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_1 = \frac{1}{64} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 64 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{64}} = \sqrt{\frac{65}{64}} = \frac{\sqrt{65}}{8} \]

This is not rational. However, if we consider \( a_1 = \frac{1}{81} \) (since \( 1 \) and \( 81 \) are perfect squares):

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{81}} = \sqrt{\frac{82}{81}} = \frac{\sqrt{82}}{9} \]
