<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let A=(1/2)*(3/4)*(5/6)*...*(99/100). Is A greater than 1/15?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. We let B=(1/2)*(2/3)*(4/5)*...*(98/99), and hence A&gt;B.
2. We have A^2&gt;AB=(1/2)*(1/2)*(2/3)*(3/4)*(4/5)*...*(98/99)*(99/100)=1/200.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s follow the partial solution provided and then continue from there.

We have A and B defined as follows:

A = (1/2) * (3/4) * (5/6) * ... * (99/100)
B = (1/2) * (2/3) * (4/5) * ... * (98/99)

It is given that A &gt; B, which makes sense because each corresponding term in A is greater than the corresponding term in B (since the numerators are the same but the denominators in A are larger, making the fractions in A larger).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the product AB:

AB = (1/2)^2 * (2/3) * (3/4) * (4/5) * ... * (98/99) * (99/100)

Notice that in the product AB, every term except the first and the last cancels out. This is because each term (n/n+1) is canceled by the term (n+1/n+2) in the next step of the multiplication. So, we are left with:

AB = (1/2)^2 * (1/100)
AB = 1/4 * 1/100
AB = 1/400

Now, we have A^2 &gt; AB, and we&#x27;ve found that AB = 1/400. Therefore:

A^2 &gt; 1/400

To find out if A is greater than 1/15, we need to take the square root of both sides of the inequality A^2 &gt; 1/400:

A &gt; sqrt(1/400)
A &gt; 1/20

Since 1/20 is greater than 1/15, we cannot directly conclude that A is greater than 1/15 just from the fact that A &gt; 1/20. We need to refine our approach to compare A with 1/15 directly.

Let&#x27;s consider the value of A^2 again:

A^2 &gt; 1/400

Now, let&#x27;s compare 1/15 with 1/20 to see which one is greater:

1/15 = 1/(3*5) = 1/15
1/20 = 1/(4*5) = 1/20

Since 3 &lt; 4, it follows that 1/15 &gt; 1/20.

Now, we have established that A &gt; 1/20, but we need to determine if A is greater than 1/15. Since 1/15 is greater than 1/20, and we only know that A is greater than 1/20, we cannot conclude that A is greater than 1/15 based on this information alone.

To determine if A is greater than 1/15, we need to find a better lower bound for A that is greater than 1/15 or directly compare A with 1/15.

Let&#x27;s try to find a better lower bound for A by comparing it with a product that is easier to evaluate. We can pair the terms in A differently to get a product that is easier to compare with 1/15:

A = (1/2) * (3/4) * (5/6) * ... * (99/100)
   = [(1/2) * (3/4)] * [(5/6) * (7/8)] * ... * [(99/100) * (101/102)]

Notice that each pair is greater than 1/4 because the numerator of the second fraction is always 2 more than the denominator of the first fraction:

(1/2) * (3/4) &gt; 1/4
(5/6) * (7/8) &gt; 1/4
...
(99/100) * (101/102) &gt; 1/4

Since there are 50 such pairs, we have:

A &gt; (1/4)^50

Now, we need to compare (1/4)^50 with 1/15. It is not practical to calculate (1/4)^50 directly, but we can estimate:

(1/4)^2 = 1/16, which is slightly less than 1/15.

Since (1/4)^50 is much smaller than (1/4)^2, it follows that (1/4)^50 is much smaller than 1/15. Therefore, we cannot conclude that A is greater than 1/15 based on this comparison.

To directly compare A with 1/15, we would need to find a more precise lower bound for A that is close to 1/15. However, the approach we&#x27;ve taken so far does not yield such a bound.

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. We can write A as follows:

A = (1/2) * (3/4) * (5/6) * ... * (99/100)
   = (1*3*5*...*99) / (2*4*6*...*100)

Now, let&#x27;s look at the denominator:

2*4*6*...*100 = 2^50 * (1*2*3*...*50)

Using the factorial notation, we can write this as:

2^50 * 50!

Now, let&#x27;s look at the numerator:

1*3*5*...*99 = (1*2*3*...*50) / (2*4*6*...*50)
              = 50! / (2^50)

Therefore, A can be written as:

A = (50! / 2^50) / (2^50 * 50!)
   = 1 / 2^100

Now, we compare A with 1/15:

A = 1 / 2^100
1/15 = 1 / (3*5)

Since 2^100 is much larger than 15, it follows that A is much smaller than 1/15. Therefore, A is not greater than 1/15.</code></pre>
