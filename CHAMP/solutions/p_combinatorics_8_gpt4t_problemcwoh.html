<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select quadruple (x, y, z, u), with duplicate allowed, such that u&gt;max(x, y, z). In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For u=i, there are i-1 values of x, y and z satisfying u&gt;max(x, y, z), so we have (i-1)^3 triples of valid (x, y, z, u).
2. Thus, the total number of choices is sum_(i=1)^(n+1) (i-1)^3=sum_(i=1)^n i^3.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 5 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors (i.e., the string does not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach by considering the different cases where 1 and 2 are not neighbors. We will count the number of valid strings by considering the positions of 1s and 2s and then filling the remaining positions with 3s and 4s.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of strings of length 5 with the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 as S(5). We will break down the problem into cases based on the number of 1s and 2s in the string.

Case 1: No 1s or 2s
If there are no 1s or 2s, then all positions are filled with either 3 or 4. There are 2 choices for each position, so there are 2^5 = 32 strings in this case.

Case 2: Only 1s, no 2s
If there are only 1s and no 2s, then we can have from 1 to 5 occurrences of 1. The remaining positions can be filled with 3s or 4s. For each number of 1s, we have:
- 1 occurrence of 1: C(5,1) * 2^4 ways (choose 1 position for the 1, fill the rest with 3 or 4)
- 2 occurrences of 1: C(5,2) * 2^3 ways
- 3 occurrences of 1: C(5,3) * 2^2 ways
- 4 occurrences of 1: C(5,4) * 2^1 ways
- 5 occurrences of 1: C(5,5) * 2^0 ways

Case 3: Only 2s, no 1s
This case is symmetrical to Case 2, so it will have the same number of strings.

Case 4: Both 1s and 2s, but not neighbors
We need to consider the different ways 1s and 2s can be arranged without being neighbors. We can have the following subcases:
- One 1 and one 2: There are C(5,2) ways to choose the positions for 1 and 2, and for each choice, there are 3! ways to arrange the remaining 3, 4, and the chosen digits (since 1 and 2 are not neighbors). However, we must subtract the arrangements where 1 and 2 are neighbors, which is 2 * C(4,1) * 2^3 (choose a block position for &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; and fill the rest with 3 or 4).
- One 1 and two 2s: There are C(5,1) ways to choose the position for 1 and C(4,2) ways to choose the positions for the 2s. The remaining positions can be filled with 3 or 4. However, we must ensure that the 2s are not adjacent to the 1, which complicates the count.
- Two 1s and one 2: This is symmetrical to the previous subcase.

Calculating the exact number for Case 4 is complex due to the constraints on the positions of 1s and 2s. Instead, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of strings that do not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings.

Let A be the set of strings containing &quot;12&quot; and B be the set of strings containing &quot;21&quot;. We want to find the number of strings in the complement of A ∪ B.

|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|

|A| is the number of strings containing &quot;12&quot;. We can treat &quot;12&quot; as a single unit, so we have 4 positions to fill (the &quot;12&quot; unit and 3 other positions). Each position can be filled with 1, 2, 3, or 4, but since we&#x27;re considering the case where &quot;12&quot; is already one of the units, we have 3 choices for each of the remaining positions. So, |A| = 3^4.

|B| is symmetrical to |A|, so |B| = 3^4 as well.

|A ∩ B| is the number of strings containing both &quot;12&quot; and &quot;21&quot;. This can only happen if the string is &quot;121&quot; with two additional digits, which can be 3 or 4. There are 2 positions for these additional digits, so |A ∩ B| = 2^2.

Now we can calculate |A ∪ B|:
|A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B| = 3^4 + 3^4 - 2^2 = 2 * 81 - 4 = 162 - 4 = 158

The total number of strings without any restrictions is 4^5, since we have 5 positions and 4 choices for each position. So, the number of valid strings is:
S(5) = 4^5 - |A ∪ B| = 1024 - 158 = 866

Therefore, there are 866 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that do not have any 1 and 2 as neighbors.</code></pre>
