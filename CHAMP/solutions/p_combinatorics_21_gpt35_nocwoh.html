Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the symmetries of a cube. A cube has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the number of ways we can choose the color for one face. We have 6 choices for the first face.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the second face. We need to count the number of distinct colorings up to rotations. If we fix one face, there are 5 remaining faces to choose from. However, rotating the cube can result in different configurations. 

If we rotate the cube so that the first face is fixed, there are 5 possible positions for the second face. However, rotating the cube can result in different configurations.
