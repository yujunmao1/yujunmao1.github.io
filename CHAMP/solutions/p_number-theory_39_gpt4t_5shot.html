Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We see that each odd-powered x term has a negative coefficient and each even-powered x term has a positive coefficient.
2. Thus, P(x)&gt;0 for x≤0.
3. For x&gt;0, we get x*P(x)=x^(2n+1)-2x^(2n)+3x^(2n-1)-4x^(2n-2)+...+(2n+1)x.
4. We have x*P(x)+P(x)=x^(2n+1)-x^(2n)+x^(2n-1)-x^(2n-2)+...+x+(2n+1)=x(1+x^(2n+1))/(1+x)+2n+1, which is positive for x&gt;0.
5. Thus, P(x)&gt;0 for x&gt;0.
6. So we have P(x)&gt;0 for all x, and the polynomial has no real root for any n.
7. So the answer is 0.</code></pre>

1. We see that x=3, with 8x^2+1=73 satisfies the requirement, and no other multiples of 3 work.
2. In addition, 8x^2+1≡1-x^2≡-(x-1)(x+1) mod 3.
3. If x is not a multiple of 3, one of x-1 and x+1 must be a multiple of 3.
4. So 8p^2+1 is a multiple of 3.
5. Thus, the only possible value for x is 3.</code></pre>

Let x be a root of the polynomial ax^2+bx+c, with a&gt;0, a+b+c≥0, a-b+c≥0, a-c≥0. What is the range of x, expressed as an interval?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let x_1, x_2 be the two roots.
2. Thus, we have b/a=-x_1-x_2 and c/a=x_1*x_2.
3. For a+b+c≥0, we have 1+b/a+c/a≥0, or 1-x_1-x_2+x_1*x_2=(1-x_1)(1-x_2)≥0.
4. For a-b+c≥0, we have 1-b/a+c/a≥0, or 1+x_1+x_2+x_1*x_2=(1+x_1)(1+x_2)≥0.
5. For a-c≥0, we have 1-c/a≥0, or 1-x_1*x_2≥0.
6. We see that -1≤x_1, x_2≤1 satisfies all three conditions.
7. If x_1&gt;1, then (1-x_1)(1-x_2)≥0 requires x_2&gt;1, which violates 1-x_1*x_2≥0.
8. If x_1&lt;-1, then (1+x_1)(1+x_2)≥0 requires x_2&lt;-1, which violates 1-x_1*x_2≥0.
9. The same reasoning can be applied to x_2.
10. Thus, we have the range for the root being [-1, 1], and the two extreme values can be achieved by the polynomial x(1+x) and x(1-x) respectively.</code></pre>

4. In addition, since y-1 | y^n-1^n for any n, we have y-1 | p(y)-p(1) for the polynomial p.
5. Since p(x) | y-1, we have p(x) | p(y)-p(1).

Find all integer solutions to the equation x^3+x^2*y+x*y^2+y^3=8(x^2+xy+y^2+1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. Let u=x+y and v=xy, and the equation can be written as u^3-2uv=8(u^2-v+1).
2. We see that u must be even since u^3=2uv+8(u^2-v+1) is even.
3. So let u=2t, and the equation becomes 8t^3-4tv=32t^2-8v+8, or 2t^3-tv=8t^2-2v+2.
4. We have v=(2t^3-8t^2-2)/(t-2).
5. We want to find the quotient and remainder of this division, and set up 2t^3-8t^2-2=(t-2)q(t)+r, where r is a number since t-2 has degree 2.
6. Plugging t=2 into the equation, we get r=16-32-2=-18.
7. Thus, we have 2t^3-8t^2-2=(t-2)(at^2+bt+c)-18.
8. Plugging t=0 into the equation, we get -2c-18=-2, or c=-8.
9. Plugging t=1 into the equation, we get -(a+b-8)-18=-8, or a+b=-2.
10. Plugging t=-1 into the equation, we get -3(a-b-8)-18=-12, or a-b=6.
11. Thus, we have a=2, b=-4.
12. So we have v=2t^2-4t-8-18/(t-2), which needs to be an integer.
13. This means that t-2 | 18, and we have t-2=±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18.
14. For these t values, the (u, v) values are then (6, -20), (2, 8), (8, -1), (0, 1), (10, 16), (-2, 4), (16, 85), (-8, 43), (22, 188), (-14, 120), (40, 711), (-32, 569).
15. Among them, only (u=x+y=10, v=xy=16) gives integer values of x, y of (x=2, y=8) or (x=8, y=2).
16. Thus, (x=2, y=8) and (x=8, y=2) are the only two solutions.</code></pre>

Find all non-negative integer solutions to the equation x^3+8x^2-6x+8=y^3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all non-negative integer solutions to the equation \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = y^3\), we can start by examining the structure of the equation and looking for ways to factor or simplify it.

The equation can be rewritten as:
\[x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x + 2)^3 + 2^3 - 6x = y^3\]

Now, let&#x27;s look at the left side of the equation. We can see that it resembles the sum of cubes, \(a^3 + b^3\), which factors as \((a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\). However, we have an additional \(-6x\) term to consider.

Let&#x27;s try to factor the left side by grouping:
\[(x + 2)^3 + 2^3 - 6x = (x + 2)^3 - 6x + 2^3\]

Notice that \((x + 2)^3\) expands to \(x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8\), so if we subtract \(6x\), we get:
\[(x^3 + 6x^2 + 12x + 8) - 6x + 8 = x^3 + 6x^2 + 6x + 16\]

This is not immediately helpful, so let&#x27;s try another approach. We can look for patterns or properties of cubes that might help us solve the equation.

One property of cubes is that for any integer \(n\), the cube \(n^3\) is congruent to either \(0\), \(1\), or \(-1\) modulo \(7\). This is because \(0^3 \equiv 0 \mod 7\), \(1^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\), \((-1)^3 \equiv -1 \mod 7\), and higher powers of integers will cycle through these remainders due to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem or direct calculation.

Let&#x27;s examine the equation modulo \(7\):
\[x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 \equiv y^3 \mod 7\]
\[x^3 + x^2 - 6x + 1 \equiv y^3 \mod 7\]

Now, we can check each non-negative integer value of \(x\) modulo \(7\) to see if the left side becomes a cubic residue modulo \(7\). We only need to check \(x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\) because of the cyclical nature of modular arithmetic.

For \(x = 0\):
\[0^3 + 0^2 - 6 \cdot 0 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7\]
\(1\) is a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\) is possible.

For \(x = 1\):
\[1^3 + 1^2 - 6 \cdot 1 + 1 \equiv -3 \mod 7\]
\(-3\) is not a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv -3 \mod 7\) is not possible.

For \(x = 2\):
\[2^3 + 2^2 - 6 \cdot 2 + 1 \equiv 8 + 4 - 12 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7\]
\(1\) is a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\) is possible.

For \(x = 3\):
\[3^3 + 3^2 - 6 \cdot 3 + 1 \equiv 27 + 9 - 18 + 1 \equiv 19 \equiv 5 \mod 7\]
\(5\) is not a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 5 \mod 7\) is not possible.

For \(x = 4\):
\[4^3 + 4^2 - 6 \cdot 4 + 1 \equiv 64 + 16 - 24 + 1 \equiv 57 \equiv 1 \mod 7\]
\(1\) is a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\) is possible.

For \(x = 5\):
\[5^3 + 5^2 - 6 \cdot 5 + 1 \equiv 125 + 25 - 30 + 1 \equiv 121 \equiv 2 \mod 7\]
\(2\) is not a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 2 \mod 7\) is not possible.

For \(x = 6\):
\[6^3 + 6^2 - 6 \cdot 6 + 1 \equiv 216 + 36 - 36 + 1 \equiv 217 \equiv 0 \mod 7\]
\(0\) is a cubic residue modulo \(7\), so \(y^3 \equiv 0 \mod 7\) is possible.

From this analysis, we see that \(x\) must be congruent to \(0\), \(2\), or \(4\) modulo \(7\) for the left side to be a cubic residue modulo \(7\). However, this is not sufficient to solve the equation, as we need to find specific integer solutions.

Let&#x27;s go back to the original equation and try to find a pattern or factor it in a different way. We can rewrite the equation as:
\[x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x^3 + 8) + (8x^2 - 6x) = y^3\]

Now, let&#x27;s factor \(8x^2 - 6x\) by taking out a common factor of \(2x\):
\[x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8 = (x^3 + 8) + 2x(4x - 3) = y^3\]

We can see that \(x^3 + 8\) is the sum of two cubes, which can be factored as:
\[x^3 + 8 = (x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 4)\]

Now, let&#x27;s substitute this back into the equation:
\[(x + 2)(x^2 - 2x + 4) + 2x(4x - 3) = y^3\]

At this point, we can look for integer solutions by trial and error, starting with the smallest non-negative integers for \(x\) and checking if the right side becomes a perfect cube.

For \(x = 0\):
\[0^3 + 8 \cdot 0^2 - 6 \cdot 0 + 8 = 8\]
\(8\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 0\) is not a solution.

For \(x = 1\):
\[1^3 + 8 \cdot 1^2 - 6 \cdot 1 + 8 = 1 + 8 - 6 + 8 = 11\]
\(11\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 1\) is not a solution.

For \(x = 2\):
\[2^3 + 8 \cdot 2^2 - 6 \cdot 2 + 8 = 8 + 32 - 12 + 8 = 36\]
\(36\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 2\) is not a solution.

For \(x = 3\):
\[3^3 + 8 \cdot 3^2 - 6 \cdot 3 + 8 = 27 + 72 - 18 + 8 = 89\]
\(89\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 3\) is not a solution.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that it will be time-consuming and not guaranteed to find all solutions. Instead, let&#x27;s look for a more systematic approach.

We can observe that if \(x\) is a non-negative integer, then \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8\) will be an increasing function of \(x\). This means that for each \(x\), there will be at most one corresponding \(y\) that satisfies the equation. We can also note that as \(x\) increases, the difference between consecutive values of \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8\) will also increase, which means that the gaps between perfect cubes will get larger.

Given these observations, we can write a simple program to check for each \(x\) whether \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8\) is a perfect cube. We can do this up to a reasonable limit, as the values will quickly become too large to be practical to check by hand.

Here&#x27;s a simple Python code snippet that could perform this check:

```python
def is_perfect_cube(n):
    return round(n ** (1/3)) ** 3 == n

for x in range(100):  # We can start with a limit of 100 for practicality
    value = x**3 + 8*x**2 - 6*x + 8
    if is_perfect_cube(value):
        print(f&quot;x = {x}, y = {round(value ** (1/3))}&quot;)
```

Running this code would give us the non-negative integer solutions for \(x\) and \(y\). However, since we are looking for a mathematical solution rather than a computational one, we can try to find a pattern or a property that would allow us to solve the equation without brute force.

One such property is that for large \(x\), the term \(x^3\) will dominate the expression \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8\), and the value will be close to a perfect cube. This means that for large \(x\), \(y\) will be approximately equal to \(x\), and the difference \(y^3 - x^3\) will be close to \(8x^2 - 6x + 8\).

Let&#x27;s consider the difference between consecutive cubes:
\[(x + 1)^3 - x^3 = 3x^2 + 3x + 1\]

We can see that for large \(x\), this difference is less than \(8x^2 - 6x + 8\), which means that there cannot be a perfect cube between \(x^3\) and \(x^3 + 8x^2 - 6x + 8\) for large \(x\). Therefore, we can conclude that if there are any solutions, they must occur for relatively small values of \(x\).

Given this insight, we can limit our search to small values of \(x\) and check each one individually. We have already checked up to \(x = 3\) without finding a solution. We can continue this process manually or with a program until we find a solution or exhaust all reasonable possibilities.

For example, continuing with \(x = 4\):
\[4^3 + 8 \cdot 4^2 - 6 \cdot 4 + 8 = 64 + 128 - 24 + 8 = 176\]
\(176\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 4\) is not a solution.

For \(x = 5\):
\[5^3 + 8 \cdot 5^2 - 6 \cdot 5 + 8 = 125 + 200 - 30 + 8 = 303\]
\(303\) is not a perfect cube, so \(x = 5\) is not a solution.

Continuing in this manner, we can check each value of \(x\) until we find a solution or determine that there are no solutions within a reasonable range of \(x\). If we do not find any solutions, we can conclude that there are no non-negative integer solutions to the equation.

In conclusion, without a clear factorization or pattern, the best approach to solving this equation is to use computational methods to check for solutions within a reasonable range of \(x\). If no solutions are found, it is likely that there are no non-negative integer solutions to the equation.</code></pre>
