<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a mathematical expression used to find the number of ways to select a subset of items from a larger set, where the order of selection does not matter. This concept is a cornerstone of combinatorics and is often used in probability theory and statistics.

The formula for combinations is given by:

\[ C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

where:
- \( C(n, k) \) or \( \binom{n}{k} \) (read as &quot;n choose k&quot;) represents the number of combinations of \( n \) items taken \( k \) at a time.
- \( n \) is the total number of items.
- \( k \) is the number of items to be chosen.
- \( n! \) (n factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \( n \) (with \( 0! \) defined as 1).
- \( k! \) and \( (n-k)! \) are the factorials of \( k \) and \( n-k \), respectively.

The combination formula calculates the number of distinct groups that can be formed, as it disregards the order of the items within the groups. For example, if you are choosing 2 fruits out of a basket containing an apple, a banana, and an orange, the possible combinations are (apple, banana), (apple, orange), and (banana, orange). Notice that (apple, banana) is considered the same as (banana, apple) because the order is not important.

Here&#x27;s an example using the combination formula:

Suppose you want to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 10. To find out how many different committees are possible, you would calculate:

\[ C(10, 3) = \binom{10}{3} = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10!}{3!7!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 120 \]

So there are 120 different ways to form a committee of 3 people from a group of 10.

The combination formula is essential when dealing with problems where the order of selection does not matter, such as when determining the number of possible hands in a card game, the number of ways to choose winners in a lottery, or the number of possible subsets of a given size from a set of items.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which at least two boys are selected to receive the toys. There are two such scenarios:

1. Two boys and one girl are selected.
2. All three boys are selected.

Let&#x27;s calculate the number of ways for each scenario:

1. Two boys and one girl are selected:
   - First, we choose 2 boys from the 4 available. This can be done in \( C(4, 2) \) ways.
   - Then, we choose 1 girl from the 6 available. This can be done in \( C(6, 1) \) ways.
   - After selecting the children, we have to distribute the 3 different toys among them. Since the toys are distinct, there are \( 3! \) (3 factorial) ways to do this.
   - The total number of ways for this scenario is the product of these counts: \( C(4, 2) \times C(6, 1) \times 3! \).

2. All three boys are selected:
   - We choose 3 boys from the 4 available. This can be done in \( C(4, 3) \) ways.
   - Since we&#x27;re not choosing any girls in this scenario, we don&#x27;t need to consider the girls&#x27; selection.
   - Again, we have to distribute the 3 different toys among the 3 boys, which can be done in \( 3! \) ways.
   - The total number of ways for this scenario is the product of these counts: \( C(4, 3) \times 3! \).

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the number of ways for each scenario:

1. \( C(4, 2) \times C(6, 1) \times 3! \):
   - \( C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \)
   - \( C(6, 1) = \frac{6!}{1!(6-1)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \)
   - \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
   - Total for this scenario: \( 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216 \)

2. \( C(4, 3) \times 3! \):
   - \( C(4, 3) = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \)
   - \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
   - Total for this scenario: \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \)

Finally, we add the number of ways for both scenarios to get the total number of ways at least two boys are selected:

Total number of ways = \( 216 + 24 = 240 \)

Therefore, there are 240 different ways to give one toy to each child, ensuring that at least two boys are selected.</code></pre>
