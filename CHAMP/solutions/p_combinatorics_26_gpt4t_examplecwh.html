<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 6 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2 and 3 have the property that any two adjacent digits differ by at most 1.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a_n, b_n and c_n be the numbers of length-n strings that end with 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Express a_(n+1), b_(n+1) and c_(n+1) in terms of a_n, b_n and c_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given information to set up recursive relationships for a_n, b_n, and c_n, which represent the number of length-n strings ending with 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

First, let&#x27;s consider the possible strings of length n+1:

- If a string of length n+1 ends with a 1, the previous digit can only be a 1 or a 2 (to satisfy the condition that adjacent digits differ by at most 1). Therefore, a_(n+1) can be formed by appending a 1 to all strings of length n that end with a 1 or a 2. This gives us the recursive relationship:
  a_(n+1) = a_n + b_n

- If a string of length n+1 ends with a 2, the previous digit can be a 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, b_(n+1) can be formed by appending a 2 to all strings of length n that end with a 1, 2, or 3. This gives us the recursive relationship:
  b_(n+1) = a_n + b_n + c_n

- If a string of length n+1 ends with a 3, the previous digit can only be a 2 or a 3. Therefore, c_(n+1) can be formed by appending a 3 to all strings of length n that end with a 2 or a 3. This gives us the recursive relationship:
  c_(n+1) = b_n + c_n

Now, let&#x27;s find the base cases for n=1:

- a_1 is the number of strings of length 1 ending with 1. There is only one such string: &quot;1&quot;. So, a_1 = 1.
- b_1 is the number of strings of length 1 ending with 2. There is only one such string: &quot;2&quot;. So, b_1 = 1.
- c_1 is the number of strings of length 1 ending with 3. There is only one such string: &quot;3&quot;. So, c_1 = 1.

Using the base cases and the recursive relationships, we can calculate a_2, b_2, and c_2:

- a_2 = a_1 + b_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 (strings: &quot;11&quot;, &quot;12&quot;)
- b_2 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 (strings: &quot;21&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, &quot;23&quot;)
- c_2 = b_1 + c_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 (strings: &quot;32&quot;, &quot;33&quot;)

Now, we can calculate a_3, b_3, and c_3:

- a_3 = a_2 + b_2 = 2 + 3 = 5
- b_3 = a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 2 + 3 + 2 = 7
- c_3 = b_2 + c_2 = 3 + 2 = 5

Continuing this process, we calculate a_4, b_4, and c_4:

- a_4 = a_3 + b_3 = 5 + 7 = 12
- b_4 = a_3 + b_3 + c_3 = 5 + 7 + 5 = 17
- c_4 = b_3 + c_3 = 7 + 5 = 12

Next, we calculate a_5, b_5, and c_5:

- a_5 = a_4 + b_4 = 12 + 17 = 29
- b_5 = a_4 + b_4 + c_4 = 12 + 17 + 12 = 41
- c_5 = b_4 + c_4 = 17 + 12 = 29

Finally, we calculate a_6, b_6, and c_6:

- a_6 = a_5 + b_5 = 29 + 41 = 70
- b_6 = a_5 + b_5 + c_5 = 29 + 41 + 29 = 99
- c_6 = b_5 + c_5 = 41 + 29 = 70

The total number of strings of length 6 that satisfy the condition is the sum of a_6, b_6, and c_6:

Total number of strings = a_6 + b_6 + c_6
Total number of strings = 70 + 99 + 70
Total number of strings = 239

Therefore, there are 239 strings of length 6 consisting of the digits 1, 2, and 3 where any two adjacent digits differ by at most 1.</code></pre>
