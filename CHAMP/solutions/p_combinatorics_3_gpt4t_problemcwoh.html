<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.
Step-wise solution:
1. For n people, C(n, k) corresponds to the number of possible ways to choose k people, and k^2 correponds to the number of ways to assign two roles, one per person, with one person holding two roles allowed.
2. Thus, we can consider the full expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
3. If the president and the secretary are the same person, we can first choose this person, with n possibilties, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-1 people, with 2^(n-1) possibilities.
4. If the president and the secretary are different people, we can first choose those two, with n(n-1) possibilities, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-2 people, with 2^(n-2) possibilities.
5. Thus, the total number of choices is n*2^(n-1)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=2n*2^(n-2)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=n(n+1)*2^(n-2).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints imposed by the 180-degree rotational invariance on the placement of the rooks.

When the chessboard is rotated 180 degrees, each rook must end up in the position of another rook. This means that for each rook placed on the board, there is exactly one other position (the one 180 degrees rotated from it) that must also contain a rook.

Let&#x27;s consider two cases based on whether n is odd or even.

**Case 1: n is even**

For an even n, the chessboard does not have a central square, and each rook&#x27;s position will be paired with another unique position after a 180-degree rotation. This means that we can divide the board into n/2 pairs of squares that are 180 degrees rotationally symmetric.

For each pair of squares, we have n choices for the first rook (since there are n rows), and then n-1 choices for the second rook (since it cannot be in the same row or column as the first rook), and so on, until we have only n/2 choices for the last pair of rooks.

Therefore, the number of ways to place n rooks peacefully with 180-degree rotational invariance on an even n x n chessboard is:

n * (n-2) * (n-4) * ... * 2

This is the product of every second number from n down to 2.

**Case 2: n is odd**

For an odd n, there is a central square on the chessboard. The rook placed on this square will remain in place after a 180-degree rotation. Therefore, there is only one choice for the rook on the central square.

For the remaining squares, we can apply the same logic as in the even case. We divide the remaining squares into (n-1)/2 pairs of squares that are 180 degrees rotationally symmetric.

For each pair of squares, we have n-1 choices for the first rook (since one row is already occupied by the central rook), and then n-3 choices for the second rook, and so on, until we have only (n-1)/2 choices for the last pair of rooks.

Therefore, the number of ways to place n rooks peacefully with 180-degree rotational invariance on an odd n x n chessboard is:

1 * (n-1) * (n-3) * ... * 2

This is the product of every second number from n-1 down to 2, multiplied by 1 for the central square.

In summary, the number of ways to place n rooks peacefully with 180-degree rotational invariance on an n x n chessboard is:

- For even n: n * (n-2) * (n-4) * ... * 2
- For odd n: 1 * (n-1) * (n-3) * ... * 2

This product is essentially the double factorial of n for even n and the double factorial of n-1 for odd n, multiplied by 1 for the central square in the odd case. The double factorial of a non-negative integer k is denoted by k!! and is the product of every second integer from k down to 2 (for even k) or 1 (for odd k).</code></pre>
