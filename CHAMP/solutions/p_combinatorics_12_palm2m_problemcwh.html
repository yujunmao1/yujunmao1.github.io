<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For each arrangement, a total of n rotations and 2 reflections all preserve the neighoring relationship.
2. Thus, the distinct number of arrangement is n!/(2n).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The following is a solution to the parking problem:

Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ be the driver preference sequences, where each $a_i$ is an integer from 1 to $n+1$. We will show that the number of sequences that satisfy the condition is $\frac{(n+1)!}{2n}$.

First, we will convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an $(n+1)^{th}$ lot that connects to both the $n^{th}$ lot and the 1st lot. This is equivalent to saying that the driver preference sequences can take values in $1$ to $n+1$.

Next, we will establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot. Consider a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. If every driver can park, then the following must be true:

1. $a_1$ must be less than or equal to $a_2$, $a_2$ must be less than or equal to $a_3$, and so on.
2. $a_n$ must be less than or equal to $a_1$.

This is because if $a_1$ is greater than $a_2$, then the first driver will not be able to park in the first lot, because it will be occupied by the second driver. Similarly, if $a_n$ is less than $a_1$, then the last driver will not be able to park in the last lot, because it will be occupied by the first driver.

Now, we will consider all driver preference sequences of length $n$ but taking values in 1 to $n+1$. How many of the satisfy the condition?

There are $(n+1)!$ such sequences. For each sequence, we can cyclically shift it $n$ times to get a new sequence. For example, if the sequence is $1, 2, 3$, then the cyclically shifted sequences are $2, 3, 1$, $3, 1, 2$, and $1, 2, 3$.

Of these $n$ cyclically shifted sequences, only one of them will satisfy the condition. This is because if we cyclically shift a sequence that satisfies the condition, we will get a sequence that also satisfies the condition. However, if we cyclically shift a sequence that does not satisfy the condition, we will get a sequence that also does not satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the number of sequences that satisfy the condition is $\frac{(n+1)!}{2n}$.

Here is a more detailed solution that includes more explanations and justifications:

Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ be the driver preference sequences, where each $a_i$ is an integer from 1 to $n+1$. We will show that the number of sequences that satisfy the condition is $\frac{(n+1)!}{2n}$.

First, we will convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an $(n+1)^{th}$ lot that connects to both the $n^{th}$ lot and the 1st lot. This is equivalent to saying that the driver preference sequences can take values in $1$ to $n+1$.

Next, we will establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot. Consider a sequence $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$. If every driver can park, then the following must be true:

1. $a_1$ must be less than or equal to $a_2$, $a_2$ must be less than or equal to $a_3$, and so on.
2. $a_n$ must be less than or equal to $a_1$.

This is because if $a_1$ is greater than $a_2$, then the first driver will not be able to park in the first lot, because it will be occupied by the second driver. Similarly, if $a_n$ is less than $a_1$, then the last driver will not be able to park in the last lot, because it will be occupied by the first driver.

Now, we will consider all driver preference sequences of length $n$ but taking values in 1 to $n+1$. How many of the satisfy the condition?
