<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer-valued solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 5?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Assume none of x, y, z are divisible by 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the fact that squares of integers have a particular behavior when divided by 5. Specifically, the square of any integer can only have a remainder of 0, 1, or 4 when divided by 5. This is because:

- If an integer is divisible by 5 (i.e., it is of the form 5k), its square is 25k^2, which is also divisible by 5.
- If an integer has a remainder of 1 or 4 when divided by 5 (i.e., it is of the form 5k+1 or 5k+4), its square is (5k+1)^2 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1 or (5k+4)^2 = 25k^2 + 40k + 16, both of which have a remainder of 1 when divided by 5.
- If an integer has a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 5 (i.e., it is of the form 5k+2 or 5k+3), its square is (5k+2)^2 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4 or (5k+3)^2 = 25k^2 + 30k + 9, both of which have a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2, where x, y, and z are integers. We are asked to determine how many of these numbers must be divisible by 5.

Let&#x27;s start with the assumption that none of x, y, z are divisible by 5. This means that the squares of x and y can only have remainders of 1 or 4 when divided by 5.

There are four possible cases for the remainders of x^2 and y^2 when divided by 5:
1. x^2 has a remainder of 1, and y^2 has a remainder of 1.
2. x^2 has a remainder of 1, and y^2 has a remainder of 4.
3. x^2 has a remainder of 4, and y^2 has a remainder of 1.
4. x^2 has a remainder of 4, and y^2 has a remainder of 4.

In cases 1 and 4, the sum x^2 + y^2 would have a remainder of 2 when divided by 5, which is not possible since z^2 must have a remainder of 0, 1, or 4.

In cases 2 and 3, the sum x^2 + y^2 would have a remainder of 0 when divided by 5, which implies that z^2 is divisible by 5, and hence z is divisible by 5.

Therefore, if none of x and y are divisible by 5, then z must be divisible by 5. This means that at least one of the three numbers must be divisible by 5.

However, we need to consider the possibility that one or both of x and y are divisible by 5. If either x or y is divisible by 5, then x^2 or y^2 (respectively) would be divisible by 5, and since z^2 = x^2 + y^2, z would also have to be divisible by 5 to satisfy the equation.

In conclusion, at least one of the three numbers x, y, or z must be divisible by 5. If none of x or y are divisible by 5, then z must be divisible by 5. If either x or y is divisible by 5, then z must also be divisible by 5. Therefore, the answer to the question is that at least one of the three numbers must be divisible by 5.</code></pre>
