Problem: Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?
Step-wise solution:
1. We let d be the first digit of the k+1 digit number and r be the last k digits.
2. Thus, the original number is 10^k*d+r and the new number is r.
3. So we have 10^k*d+r=57r, which is 10^k*d=56r.
4. Thus, 56 | 10^k*d, which means 7 | 10^k*d and 8 | 10^k*d.
5. Since 10^k only has prime factors 2 and 5 and is not divisible by 7, we must have d=7.
6. So we need 8 | 10^k and the smallest k is 3.
7. Thus, we have 7000+r=57r, and r=125.
8. So the number that we are finding is 7125.

Problem: What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 36^m always ends in 6 and 5^n always ends in 5, |36^m-5^n| can only end in 1 or 9.
2. If |36^m-5^n|=1, we need 36^m-5^n=1.
3. 5^n=36^m-1=(6^m)^2-1=(6^m+1)(6^m-1).
4. However, 6^m+1 is not divisible by 5 since it ends with 7, but 5^n only has prime factors of 5.
5. Thus, the equation has no solution.
6. If |36^m-5^n|=9, we need 5^n-36^m=9.
7. We have 5^n-36^m mod 6=(-1)^n-0 mod 6=Â±1, which is not equal to 9 mod 6=3.
8. Thus, the equation again has no solution.
9. |36^m-5^n|=11 can be solved by m=1, n=2.
10. So 11 is the smallest possible value.

Problem: What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We see that |12^m-5^n| cannot be 0 for positive m, n due to different parity.
2. Since gcd(12, 5)=1, we have gcd(12^m, 5^n)=1, so 12^m-5^n will not be divisible by factor of 12 or 5 (other than 1), i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
3. We first check if |12^m-5^n|=1 has a solution.
4. If 12^m-5^n=1, we have 5^n=12^m-1=(6^m+1)(6^m-1), but 6^m+1 ends in 7 and thus is not divisible by 5.
5. Since 5^n only has prime factor of 5, the equation has no solution.
6. If 5^n-12^m=1, we need 5^n mod 3=1, which is true only if n is even.
7. Thus, let n=2k, we have 12^m=(5^k+1)(5^k-1) and 5^k+1 mod 4=1^k+1 mod 4=2.
8. We have 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m.
9. Thus, we must have 5^k+1=2*3^v, which means we need 5^k-1=2^(2m-1)3^(m-v).
10. Since (5^k+1)-(5^k-1)=2, at most one of them is divisible by 3.
11. Thus, v=0 or v=m.
12. If v=0, we have 5^k+1=2, which means k=0 and n=2k=0 is not positive.
13. If v=m, we have (5^k+1)-(5^k-1)=2*3^m-2^(2m-1)=2(3^m-4^(m-1))=2.
14. So 3^m-4^(m-1)=1, which is not satisfied for any positive integer m.
15. Thus, we cannot have |5^n-12^m|.
16. Skipping all the impossible values from 2 to 6, we see that |12^m-5^n|=7 can be solved with m=n=1.
17. Thus, the answer is 7.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. 1971=27*73.
2. Find a mod 27 and a mod 73.
3. Set up the equation of a=27x+p=73y+q for suitable p, q and starting from y=0, increment y to find the smallest value that satisfy the equation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest positive integer \( a \) such that \( 1971 \) divides \( 50^n + 23^n \cdot a \) for odd \( n \), we need to consider the prime factorization of \( 1971 \), which is \( 1971 = 27 \cdot 73 \). Since \( 1971 \) is the product of two distinct primes, we need to find \( a \) such that both \( 27 \) and \( 73 \) divide \( 50^n + 23^n \cdot a \) for odd \( n \).

Let&#x27;s first consider the divisibility by \( 27 \) and \( 73 \) separately.

For \( 27 \), we have:
\[ 50^n + 23^n \cdot a \equiv 0 \pmod{27} \]
Since \( 50 \equiv 23 \pmod{27} \), we can simplify the equation to:
\[ 23^n + 23^n \cdot a \equiv 0 \pmod{27} \]
\[ 23^n \cdot (1 + a) \equiv 0 \pmod{27} \]
Since \( 23 \) and \( 27 \) are coprime, \( 23^n \) will never be divisible by \( 27 \), so we need \( 1 + a \) to be divisible by \( 27 \). The smallest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies this is \( a = 26 \) because \( 1 + 26 = 27 \), which is divisible by \( 27 \).

For \( 73 \), we have:
\[ 50^n + 23^n \cdot a \equiv 0 \pmod{73} \]
Since \( 50 \equiv -23 \pmod{73} \), and \( n \) is odd, we can simplify the equation to:
\[ (-23)^n + 23^n \cdot a \equiv 0 \pmod{73} \]
\[ -23^n + 23^n \cdot a \equiv 0 \pmod{73} \]
\[ 23^n \cdot (a - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{73} \]
Since \( 23 \) and \( 73 \) are coprime, \( 23^n \) will never be divisible by \( 73 \), so we need \( a - 1 \) to be divisible by \( 73 \). The smallest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies this is \( a = 74 \) because \( 74 - 1 = 73 \), which is divisible by \( 73 \).

Now we need to find the smallest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies both conditions simultaneously. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve the system of congruences:
\[ a \equiv 26 \pmod{27} \]
\[ a \equiv 74 \pmod{73} \]

Let&#x27;s find \( a \) in the form of \( a = 27x + 26 = 73y + 74 \). We can start by setting \( y = 0 \) and incrementing \( y \) to find the smallest value that satisfies both equations.

For \( y = 0 \), we have \( a = 73 \cdot 0 + 74 = 74 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).

Incrementing \( y \), we get:
For \( y = 1 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 1 + 74 = 147 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 2 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 2 + 74 = 220 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).

For \( y = 18 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 18 + 74 = 1388 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 19 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 19 + 74 = 1461 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 20 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 20 + 74 = 1534 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 21 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 21 + 74 = 1607 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 22 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 22 + 74 = 1680 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 23 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 23 + 74 = 1753 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 24 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 24 + 74 = 1826 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 25 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 25 + 74 = 1899 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 26 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 26 + 74 = 1972 \), which is not congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).
For \( y = 27 \), \( a = 73 \cdot 27 + 74 = 2045 \), which is congruent to \( 26 \pmod{27} \).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( a \) that satisfies both conditions is \( a = 2045 \).</code></pre>
