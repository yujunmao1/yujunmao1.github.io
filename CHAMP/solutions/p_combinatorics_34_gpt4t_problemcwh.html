<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We define P(k) as the number of strings with k number of 1s, so P(k)=C(n, k)*3^(n-k).
2. Thus, the number of length-n strings with an even number of 1s is E(n)=P(0)+P(2)+...=C(n, 0)*3^n+C(n, 2)*3^(n-2)....
3. The number of length-n strings with an odd number of 1s is O(n)=P(1)+P(3)+...=C(n, 1)*3^(n-1)+C(n, 3)*3^(n-3)....
4. We have E(n)+O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*1^k=(3+1)^n=4^n.
5. In addition, E(n)-O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*(-1)^k=(3-1)^n=2^n.
6. Thus, E(n)=(4^n+2^n)/2.

Problem: Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let x_n, y_n, z_n be the number of length-n strings that end with digit 1, 2, 3 respectively.
2. Thus, we have x_1=y_1=z_1=1.
3. For a string ending with 1, we can append 1 and 2; for a string ending with 2, we can append 1, 2 and 3; for a string ending with 3, we can append 2 and 3.
4. Thus, we have x_(n+1)=x_n+y_n, y_(n+1)=x_n+y_n+z_n, and z_(n+1)=y_n+z_n.
5. Starting from (1, 1, 1), we have the sequence of (x_n, y_n, z_n) to be (1, 1, 1), (2, 3, 2), (5, 7, 5), (12, 17, 12), (29, 41, 29), (70, 99, 70).
6. Thus, in total, there are x_6+y_6+z_6=70+99+70=239 such strings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Among all sequences of positive integer numbers have sum n, for integer k&lt;n-1, how many times does the number k appear, as an expression of n and k?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider a row of n points, with n-1 gaps.
2. Insert dividers into the gaps to form groups of points and study the formation of the group of k points.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial argument known as &quot;stars and bars&quot; or &quot;balls and bins.&quot; The idea is to represent the sequences of positive integers that sum to n as arrangements of stars and bars, where the stars represent the units that add up to n, and the bars represent dividers between different numbers in the sequence.

For example, if n = 5, a sequence like (1, 3, 1) can be represented as &quot;* | * * * | *&quot;.

Now, let&#x27;s consider how many times the number k appears in all sequences of positive integers that sum to n. We can think of this as fixing k stars together to represent the number k, and then arranging the remaining stars and bars.

Since we have n stars in total and we fix k of them together, we have n - k stars left to arrange. We also have n - 1 gaps between these stars where we can place bars to create different numbers. However, since we are fixing k stars together, we effectively have one less gap where we can place a bar, so we have n - 2 gaps remaining.

The number of ways to place bars in these gaps is equivalent to the number of ways to partition the remaining n - k stars into positive integers, which is the same as the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to n - k.

To find this number, we use the &quot;stars and bars&quot; theorem, which states that the number of ways to distribute n indistinguishable items into k distinguishable bins is given by the binomial coefficient C(n + k - 1, k - 1).

In our case, we want to distribute n - k stars into bins separated by n - 2 bars. The number of bins is one more than the number of bars, so we have n - 2 + 1 = n - 1 bins.

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the remaining n - k stars with n - 2 bars is given by the binomial coefficient C((n - k) + (n - 1) - 1, (n - 1) - 1), which simplifies to C(n - k + n - 2, n - 2).

This is the number of sequences of positive integers that sum to n where the number k appears exactly once. However, k can appear more than once in a sequence, so we need to account for all possible occurrences of k.

To do this, we can consider the number of times k can appear in a sequence. Since k &lt; n - 1, the maximum number of times k can appear is floor((n - 1) / k). Let&#x27;s denote this maximum number as m.

For each possible occurrence i from 1 to m, we can calculate the number of sequences where k appears i times using the same &quot;stars and bars&quot; argument, but now we fix i groups of k stars and distribute the remaining stars.

The total number of times k appears in all sequences is the sum of the number of sequences where k appears i times for all i from 1 to m.

Therefore, the total number of times k appears in all sequences of positive integers that sum to n is:

Sum_{i=1}^m C(n - i*k + n - 2, n - 2).

This expression gives us the total count of the number k in all sequences, considering all possible occurrences of k.</code></pre>
