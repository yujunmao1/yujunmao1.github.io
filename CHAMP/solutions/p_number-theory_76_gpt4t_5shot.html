2. We have 2^4=16, so (27)^(1/4)&gt;2, and x_(n+1)=2/5*(27)^(1/4)&gt;4/5.
3. Since x_1=2 is also greater than 4/5, we know that all 1000 numbers are greater than 4/5.</code></pre>

3. However, since 1981 mod 8=5, z^2-1981 mod 8∈{3, 4, 7}.

1. We have x^3=4y^2+4y+1-4=(2y+1)^2-2^2=(2y+3)(2y-1).
2. gcd(2y+3, 2y-1)=gcd(2y+3-(2y-1), 2y-1)=gcd(4, 2y-1)=1 since 4 only has prime factor of 2 and 2y-1 is odd.
3. Thus, we have 2y+3=u^3 and 2y-1=v^3 with gcd(u,v)=1 and u,v≥1.
4. This means that u^3-v^3=4, but u^3-v^3=(u-v)(u^2+uv+v^2), which is at least 7 (for u=2, v=1).

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #DBDB8D !important;'>Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2x_(i+1)^2-(x_i+2/x_i)x_(i+1)+1=0.
2. Thus, x_(i+1)=x_i/2 or 1/x_i.
3. We can write x_0=2^(k_0)*x_0^e_0, where k_0=0, e_0=1.
4. If we can write x_i=2^k_i*x_0^e_i, then x_(i+1)=x_i/2=2^(k_i-1)*x_0^e_i, or x_(i+1)=1/x_i=2^(-k)*x_0^(-e_i).
5. Thus, we have k_(i+1)=k_i-1, e_(i+1)=e_i or k_(i+1)=-k_i, e_(i+1)=-e_i.
6. Since k_0=0, we see that |k_i|≤i.
7. We also have e_i=(-1)^(k_i+i) since exactly when k keeps its parity by being the same as k_(i-1), e_i is inverted.
8. If k_1995 is odd, then e_1995=(-1)^(k_1995+1995)=1.
9. So we have x_1995=2^k_1995*x_0, which cannot be equal to x_0 for any odd k_1995, so k_1995 cannot be odd.
10. Thus, k_1995 is even, with e_1995=-1, and we have x_1995=2^k*x_0^(-1)=x_0.
11. Since the largest value of k_1995 is 1994, we have x_0^2=2^1994, and x_0=2^997.
12. This sequence can be achieved with x_0=2^997, x_1=2^996, x_2=2^995, ..., x_1994=2^(-997), and x_1995=1/x_1994=2^997.
13. So the largest value of x_0 is 2^997.</code></pre>

Find the four-digit number abcd such that 4*abcd=dcba.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the four-digit number \( abcd \) such that \( 4 \cdot abcd = dcba \), we can set up an equation using the place values of the digits in the number \( abcd \). Let \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) represent the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits, respectively. Then the number \( abcd \) can be represented as \( 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \), and the number \( dcba \) can be represented as \( 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \).

The equation given in the problem is:
\[ 4 \cdot (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ 4000a + 400b + 40c + 4d = 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Now, we can rearrange the terms to group the coefficients of the same digits:
\[ 3999a + 390b + 60c - 996d = 0 \]

Since \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9. Also, \( a \) cannot be 0 because \( abcd \) is a four-digit number. We can also see that \( d \) cannot be 0 because if \( d \) were 0, then \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would end in 0, which is not possible since \( dcba \) is also a four-digit number and \( a \) cannot be 0.

We can divide the entire equation by 3 to simplify it:
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332d = 0 \]

Now, we can try to find a solution by considering the possible values of \( d \) since it is multiplied by a large negative number, and we want the entire expression to be zero. We can start by trying \( d = 1 \) and see if we can find corresponding values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy the equation.

If \( d = 1 \), the equation becomes:
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 332 \]

Since \( a \) must be a digit from 1 to 9, we can try these values one by one and check if the rest of the equation can be satisfied with appropriate values for \( b \) and \( c \). However, we can notice that the right side of the equation, 332, is divisible by 4, and since \( 1333a \) is also divisible by 4 for any digit \( a \), \( 130b + 20c \) must be divisible by 4 as well. This means that \( b \) and \( c \) must be chosen such that their combination yields a number divisible by 4.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \) (since \( a = 1 \) would not give us a four-digit number when multiplied by 4):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 332 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 332 \]

This equation cannot be true because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \) (even though it would not give us a four-digit number when multiplied by 4, we can use it to understand the pattern):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 332 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 332 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = -1001 \]

This is not possible since \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative integers. Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 1.

Since we are looking for a four-digit number, we can try larger values of \( a \) and \( d \) to see if we can find a solution. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 2 \) (since \( d \) cannot be 1 because \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would not end in 1):
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332 \cdot 2 = 0 \]
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 664 \]

Now, we can try different values of \( a \) to see if we can satisfy the equation. Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 664 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 664 \]

This is not possible because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 664 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 664 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = 664 - 1333 \]
\[ 130b + 20c = -669 \]

This is not possible since \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative integers. Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 1.

Since we are looking for a four-digit number, we can try larger values of \( a \) and \( d \) to see if we can find a solution. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 3 \) (since \( d \) cannot be 1 or 2 because \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would not end in 1 or 2):
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332 \cdot 3 = 0 \]
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 996 \]

Now, we can try different values of \( a \) to see if we can satisfy the equation. Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 996 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 996 \]

This is not possible because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 996 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 996 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = 996 - 1333 \]
\[ 130b + 20c = -337 \]

This is not possible since \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative integers. Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 1.

Since we are looking for a four-digit number, we can try larger values of \( a \) and \( d \) to see if we can find a solution. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 4 \) (since \( d \) cannot be 1, 2, or 3 because \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would not end in 1, 2, or 3):
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332 \cdot 4 = 0 \]
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 1328 \]

Now, we can try different values of \( a \) to see if we can satisfy the equation. Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 1328 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 1328 \]

This is not possible because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 1328 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 1328 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = 1328 - 1333 \]
\[ 130b + 20c = -5 \]

This is not possible since \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative integers. Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 1.

Since we are looking for a four-digit number, we can try larger values of \( a \) and \( d \) to see if we can find a solution. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 5 \) (since \( d \) cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 4 because \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would not end in 1, 2, 3, or 4):
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332 \cdot 5 = 0 \]
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 1660 \]

Now, we can try different values of \( a \) to see if we can satisfy the equation. Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 1660 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 1660 \]

This is not possible because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 1660 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 1660 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = 1660 - 1333 \]
\[ 130b + 20c = 327 \]

Now, we need to find values of \( b \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( b \) and \( c \) are digits, they must be between 0 and 9. We can try different values of \( b \) and see if we can find a corresponding value for \( c \) that satisfies the equation.

Let&#x27;s try \( b = 2 \):
\[ 130 \cdot 2 + 20c = 327 \]
\[ 260 + 20c = 327 \]

Subtracting 260 from both sides, we get:
\[ 20c = 327 - 260 \]
\[ 20c = 67 \]

This is not possible because \( c \) must be a digit between 0 and 9, and \( 67 \) is not divisible by 20. Therefore, \( b \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( b = 1 \):
\[ 130 \cdot 1 + 20c = 327 \]
\[ 130 + 20c = 327 \]

Subtracting 130 from both sides, we get:
\[ 20c = 327 - 130 \]
\[ 20c = 197 \]

This is not possible because \( c \) must be a digit between 0 and 9, and \( 197 \) is not divisible by 20. Therefore, \( b \) cannot be 1.

Since we are looking for a four-digit number, we can try larger values of \( a \) and \( d \) to see if we can find a solution. Let&#x27;s try \( d = 6 \) (since \( d \) cannot be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 because \( 4 \cdot abcd \) would not end in 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5):
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c - 332 \cdot 6 = 0 \]
\[ 1333a + 130b + 20c = 1992 \]

Now, we can try different values of \( a \) to see if we can satisfy the equation. Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 2 + 130b + 20c = 1992 \]
\[ 2666 + 130b + 20c = 1992 \]

This is not possible because the left side is already much larger than the right side with the smallest possible values for \( b \) and \( c \). Therefore, \( a \) cannot be 2.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \):
\[ 1333 \cdot 1 + 130b + 20c = 1992 \]
\[ 1333 + 130b + 20c = 1992 \]

Subtracting 1333 from both sides, we get:
\[ 130b + 20c = 1992 - 1333 \]
\[ 130b + 20c = 659 \]

Now, we need to find values of \( b \) and \( c \) that satisfy this equation. Since \( b \) and \( c \) are</code></pre>
