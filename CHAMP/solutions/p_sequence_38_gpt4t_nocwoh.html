The terms of the sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ... are all positive, and a_(n+1)=sqrt(1+a_n) for all n. Does there exist such a sequence with all a_n being rational numbers, and if so, find the smallest possible value of a_1 such that the sequence satisfies the condition.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if there exists a sequence \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) with all terms being rational numbers and satisfying the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we need to investigate the properties of the sequence.

Let&#x27;s start by assuming that \( a_1 \) is a rational number. We want to see if this assumption can lead to all subsequent terms \( a_n \) also being rational.

Given \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \), we can square both sides to get:

\[ a_{n+1}^2 = 1 + a_n \]

This implies that:

\[ a_n = a_{n+1}^2 - 1 \]

Now, if \( a_{n+1} \) is rational, then \( a_{n+1}^2 \) is also rational, and thus \( a_n \) would be rational as well (since the difference of two rational numbers is rational).

To find the smallest possible value of \( a_1 \) such that all \( a_n \) are rational, we can work backwards from the assumption that \( a_n \) is rational for some \( n \). We want to find a rational number \( a_1 \) such that when we apply the recurrence relation, we continue to get rational numbers.

Let&#x27;s consider the smallest positive rational number that, when squared and decreased by 1, yields another rational number. This would be the case if \( a_{n+1}^2 - 1 \) is a perfect square of a rational number.

Let&#x27;s denote \( a_{n+1} \) as \( r \), where \( r \) is rational. Then we have:

\[ r^2 - 1 = (r - 1)(r + 1) \]

For \( r^2 - 1 \) to be a perfect square, both \( r - 1 \) and \( r + 1 \) must be perfect squares or their product must be a perfect square. The smallest positive rational numbers that satisfy this condition are consecutive integers, since the product of two consecutive integers is never a perfect square.

However, we can consider the case where \( r - 1 \) and \( r + 1 \) are both squares of rational numbers. The smallest such case is when \( r - 1 = (\frac{1}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{4} \) and \( r + 1 = (\frac{3}{2})^2 = \frac{9}{4} \), which implies \( r = \frac{5}{4} \).

So, if we set \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \), then \( a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is not rational. Therefore, \( a_1 = \frac{1}{4} \) does not lead to a sequence of all rational numbers.

However, if we set \( a_1 = \frac{5}{4} \), then \( a_2 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{5}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is rational. Continuing this process, we get:

\[ a_3 = \sqrt{1 + \frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \]

This is not rational, so \( a_1 = \frac{5}{4} \) also does not lead to a sequence of all rational numbers.

We need to find a starting value \( a_1 \) such that each term \( a_{n+1} \) is the square root of a rational number that is 1 more than a previous term, and this process must continue indefinitely with rational results.

Let&#x27;s consider the case where \( a_1 \) is a perfect square, say \( a_1 = (\frac{p}{q})^2 \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are integers with no common factors. Then \( a_2 = \sqrt{1 + (\frac{p}{q})^2} \). For \( a_2 \) to be rational, \( 1 + (\frac{p}{q})^2 \) must be a perfect square of a rational number.

Let&#x27;s denote \( 1 + (\frac{p}{q})^2 \) as \( (\frac{r}{s})^2 \), where \( r \) and \( s \) are integers with no common factors. We then have:

\[ (\frac{p}{q})^2 + 1 = (\frac{r}{s})^2 \]

Multiplying through by \( q^2s^2 \), we get:

\[ p^2s^2 + q^2s^2 = r^2q^2 \]

This is a Diophantine equation, and we are looking for the smallest positive integer solution for \( p, q, r, s \). We can rearrange the equation as:

\[ r^2q^2 - p^2s^2 = q^2s^2 \]

This is a difference of two squares, which can be factored as:

\[ (rq + ps)(rq - ps) = q^2s^2 \]

For the smallest solution, we want \( rq + ps \) and \( rq - ps \) to be as close as possible, which suggests they should be consecutive factors of \( q^2s^2 \). The smallest such case is when \( rq + ps = qs \) and \( rq - ps = qs \), which implies \( rq = qs \) and \( ps = 0 \). However, this is not possible since \( p \) and \( s \) cannot both be zero.

We need to find the next smallest pair of factors of \( q^2s^2 \) that differ by 2ps. If we let \( s = 1 \) to minimize the value, we have \( r^2q^2 - p^2 = q^2 \), which simplifies to:

\[ r^2q^2 - q^2 = p^2 \]

\[ q^2(r^2 - 1) = p^2 \]

Since \( r^2 - 1 = (r - 1)(r + 1) \), we need \( r - 1 \) and \( r + 1 \) to be factors of \( p^2 \), and \( q \) to be a factor of \( p \). The smallest such case is when \( r - 1 = 1 \) and \( r + 1 = 3 \), which implies \( r = 2 \). This gives us \( q^2(2^2 - 1) = p^2 \), or \( 3q^2 = p^2 \).

Since \( p \) and \( q \) have no common factors, the only way for \( 3q^2 \) to be a perfect square is if \( q^2 \) itself is a multiple of 3, which implies \( q \) is a multiple of 3. The smallest such \( q \) is 3 itself, which gives us \( p^2 = 3 \times 3^2 = 27 \), and thus \( p = \sqrt{27} = 3\sqrt{3} \).

However, \( p \) must be an integer, and \( 3\sqrt{3} \) is not an integer. Therefore, there is no integer solution for \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfies the equation with \( q = 3 \).

We need to find the smallest \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( 3q^2 = p^2 \) and both \( p \) and \( q \) are integers. The smallest integer solution is \( p = 3 \) and \( q = 1 \), which gives us \( a_1 = (\frac{p}{q})^2 = (\frac{3}{1})^2 = 9 \).

Let&#x27;s check if this value of \( a_1 \) leads to a sequence of rational numbers:

\[ a_1 = 9 \]
\[ a_2 = \sqrt{1 + a_1} = \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} \]

Since \( \sqrt{10} \) is not a rational number, \( a_1 = 9 \) does not lead to a sequence of all rational numbers.

We need to find a starting value \( a_1 \) that is a perfect square and leads to a sequence where each term is the square root of a rational number that is 1 more than the previous term. This process must continue indefinitely with rational results.

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. We can look for a perfect square that, when increased by 1, is also a perfect square. The smallest such pair of perfect squares is \( 0^2 \) and \( 1^2 \), but since we are looking for positive terms, we cannot use 0.

The next smallest pair is \( 1^2 \) and \( 2^2 \), but \( 1 + 1 \) is not a perfect square. We need to find a pair of perfect squares such that the difference between them is 1.

Let&#x27;s denote the two consecutive perfect squares as \( x^2 \) and \( (x+1)^2 \). We have:

\[ (x+1)^2 - x^2 = 1 \]
\[ x^2 + 2x + 1 - x^2 = 1 \]
\[ 2x + 1 = 1 \]
\[ 2x = 0 \]

This implies \( x = 0 \), which we&#x27;ve already determined is not a valid solution since we need positive terms.

We need to find a perfect square \( x^2 \) such that \( x^2 + 1 \) is also a perfect square. Let&#x27;s denote \( x^2 + 1 \) as \( y^2 \), where \( y \) is an integer. We then have:

\[ y^2 - x^2 = 1 \]
\[ (y - x)(y + x) = 1 \]

Since \( y \) and \( x \) are integers, the only way for their product to be 1 is if \( y - x = 1 \) and \( y + x = 1 \). However, this is not possible since \( y \) and \( x \) are both positive integers and \( y &gt; x \).

Therefore, there is no pair of perfect squares differing by 1 other than \( 0^2 \) and \( 1^2 \), which does not satisfy our requirement for positive terms.

Since we cannot find a starting value \( a_1 \) that is a perfect square and leads to a sequence of rational numbers, we must conclude that there does not exist a sequence \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) with all terms being rational numbers that satisfies the condition \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{1 + a_n} \) for all \( n \).</code></pre>
