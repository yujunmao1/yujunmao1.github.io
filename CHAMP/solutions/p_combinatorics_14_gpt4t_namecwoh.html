<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, without considering the order in which they are chosen. This is often referred to as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is denoted by C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to be chosen.

The combination formula is given by:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let&#x27;s break down the formula:

- n! is the factorial of the total number of items, which represents the number of ways to arrange all n items in a sequence.
- k! is the factorial of the number of items chosen, which accounts for the fact that the order of selection within the chosen subset does not matter.
- (n - k)! is the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items chosen, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining items that were not chosen.

By dividing n! by the product of k! and (n - k)!, we effectively count each subset of size k exactly once, regardless of the order in which its elements are listed.

For example, if you have a set of 5 items (n = 5) and you want to know how many ways you can choose 2 items (k = 2) from this set, you would calculate it as follows:

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1) * (3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.

So there are 10 different ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5.

The combination formula is widely used in probability theory, statistics, and various fields where the concept of selecting subsets is relevant. It is also closely related to the binomial theorem, which describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the principle of complementary counting. Instead of directly calculating the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other, we can calculate the probability that at least two apple trees are next to each other and then subtract this from 1 to find the desired probability.

First, let&#x27;s calculate the total number of ways to plant the trees without any restrictions. There are 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees, making a total of 3 + 3 + 2 = 8 trees.

The total number of ways to arrange these 8 trees is the number of permutations of the trees, taking into account that there are trees of the same kind. This can be calculated using the multinomial coefficient:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!)

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other. We can treat the pair of apple trees that must be together as a single entity. So, we have 2 apple trees (treated as one entity), 1 individual apple tree, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees, making a total of 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 = 8 entities.

First, we choose 2 apple trees to be together in C(3, 2) ways. Then, we arrange these 7 entities (the pair of apple trees as one entity and the other 6 individual trees) in:

7! / (2! * 3! * 2!)

However, since we have 3 apple trees and we are choosing 2 to be together, we need to multiply by C(3, 2) to account for the different pairs of apple trees that could be together:

C(3, 2) * (7! / (2! * 3! * 2!))

Now, we have the number of arrangements where at least two apple trees are next to each other, but we have not considered the case where all three apple trees are together. We need to subtract the cases where all three apple trees are together from the above count.

When all three apple trees are together, we treat them as a single entity. So, we have 1 entity of apple trees, 3 peach trees, and 2 cherry trees, making a total of 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 entities.

The number of ways to arrange these 6 entities is:

6! / (3! * 2!)

Now, we have all the pieces to calculate the probability:

P(at least two apple trees together) = [C(3, 2) * (7! / (2! * 3! * 2!))] - (6! / (3! * 2!))

P(no two apple trees together) = 1 - P(at least two apple trees together)

Let&#x27;s calculate the actual numbers:

Total arrangements = 8! / (3! * 3! * 2!) = 40320 / (6 * 6 * 2) = 40320 / 72 = 560

Arrangements with at least two apple trees together = C(3, 2) * (7! / (2! * 3! * 2!)) = 3 * (5040 / (2 * 6 * 2)) = 3 * (5040 / 24) = 3 * 210 = 630

Arrangements with all three apple trees together = 6! / (3! * 2!) = 720 / (6 * 2) = 720 / 12 = 60

Now we subtract the cases where all three apple trees are together from the cases where at least two are together:

630 - 60 = 570

Finally, we calculate the probability:

P(no two apple trees together) = 1 - P(at least two apple trees together) = 1 - (570 / 560) = 1 - 1.01786...

Since the probability cannot be greater than 1, it seems we have made a mistake in our calculations. Let&#x27;s revisit our steps:

The error lies in the calculation of arrangements with at least two apple trees together. We should not have subtracted the cases where all three apple trees are together because they are already included in the count of arrangements where at least two apple trees are together. Let&#x27;s correct this:

P(at least two apple trees together) = C(3, 2) * (7! / (2! * 3! * 2!)) = 3 * (5040 / 24) = 3 * 210 = 630

However, we have overcounted because the pair of apple trees can be arranged in 2! ways within their entity. So we need to divide by 2!:

Corrected arrangements with at least two apple trees together = 630 / 2! = 630 / 2 = 315

Now we can calculate the correct probability:

P(no two apple trees together) = 1 - P(at least two apple trees together) = 1 - (315 / 560) = 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375

So the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is 0.4375 or 43.75%.</code></pre>
