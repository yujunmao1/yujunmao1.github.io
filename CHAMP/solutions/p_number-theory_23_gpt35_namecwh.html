<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The square of sum and difference formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to expand the square of a binomial expression. It is derived from the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the square of their sum and the square of their difference can be expressed as follows:

(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Square of the sum:
To find the square of the sum of two numbers, a and b, we square each term individually and then add the cross product of the two terms. The formula (a + b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a + b)
           = a(a + b) + b(a + b)
           = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2
           = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

2. Square of the difference:
To find the square of the difference between two numbers, a and b, we follow a similar process. The formula (a - b)^2 can be expanded as follows:

(a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a - b)
           = a(a - b) - b(a - b)
           = a^2 - ab - ba + b^2
           = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

The key difference between the two formulas is the sign of the cross product term. In the square of the sum formula, the cross product term is positive (+2ab), while in the square of the difference formula, the cross product term is negative (-2ab).

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to expand binomial expressions and work with them more easily.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to factorize a binomial expression that is in the form of the difference between two perfect squares. It is derived from the square of a binomial formula.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the difference between their squares can be expressed as follows:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Difference of squares:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of a difference between two perfect squares, such as a^2 - b^2, we can factorize it using the difference of squares formula.

2. Factoring using the formula:
To factorize a^2 - b^2, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a + b) and (a - b). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - ab + ba - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

The cross product terms, ab and ba, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^2 - b^2.

This formula is useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. It allows us to factorize expressions quickly and efficiently, especially when they are in the form of the difference between two perfect squares.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The sum and difference of cubes formula is a mathematical formula that allows us to factorize a binomial expression that is in the form of the sum or difference of two cubes. It is derived from the cube of a binomial formula.

The formula states that for any two numbers, a and b, the sum or difference of their cubes can be expressed as follows:

1. Sum of cubes:
a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)

2. Difference of cubes:
a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)

Let&#x27;s break down the formula and understand how it works:

1. Sum of cubes:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of the sum of two cubes, such as a^3 + b^3, we can factorize it using the sum of cubes formula.

To factorize a^3 + b^3, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a + b) and (a^2 - ab + b^2). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2) = a^3 - a^2b + ab^2 + ba^2 - ab^2 + b^3
                         = a^3 + b^3

The cross product terms, -a^2b and ba^2, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^3 + b^3.

2. Difference of cubes:
When we have a binomial expression in the form of the difference of two cubes, such as a^3 - b^3, we can factorize it using the difference of cubes formula.

To factorize a^3 - b^3, we write it as the product of two binomial expressions: (a - b) and (a^2 + ab + b^2). The formula allows us to directly factorize the expression without expanding it.

(a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = a^3 - ab^2 + ba^2 + ab^2 - b^3
                         = a^3 - b^3

The cross product terms, -ab^2 and ba^2, cancel each other out, resulting in the simplified expression a^3 - b^3.

These formulas are useful in algebraic manipulations, simplifying expressions, and solving equations. They allow us to factorize expressions quickly and efficiently, especially when they are in the form of the sum or difference of cubes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all positive integer solutions to the equation x^3+3=4y(y+1).

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Express x^3 as the product of two factors involving y.
2. Compute the greatest common divisor of the two factors.
3. For integer a, b with a&gt;b, gcd(a, b)=gcd(b, a-b). 
4. If ab=c^k and gcd(a, b)=1, then a=u^k and b=v^k for gcd(u, v)=1 and uv=c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation x^3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1), we can follow the steps below:

Step 1: Express x^3 as the product of two factors involving y.
Let&#x27;s rewrite the equation as x^3 = 4y(y + 1) - 3. Now, we can express x^3 as the product of two factors involving y:
x^3 = (2y + 1)(2y - 1)

Step 2: Compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two factors.
The gcd of (2y + 1) and (2y - 1) can be found using the property gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a - b). Applying this property, we have:
gcd(2y + 1, 2y - 1) = gcd(2y - 1, 2y - 1 - (2y + 1))
                    = gcd(2y - 1, -2)

Since the gcd is a positive integer, we can ignore the negative sign and find the gcd of 2y - 1 and 2:
gcd(2y - 1, 2) = 1

Step 3: Apply the property ab = c^k and gcd(a, b) = 1.
From step 2, we know that the gcd of (2y + 1) and (2y - 1) is 1. This implies that (2y + 1) and (2y - 1) are coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1.

Since x^3 = (2y + 1)(2y - 1), and the factors (2y + 1) and (2y - 1) are coprime, we can conclude that each factor must be a perfect cube.

Step 4: Solve for y.
Let&#x27;s set (2y + 1) = a^3 and (2y - 1) = b^3, where a and b are positive integers.

From the given information, we know that ab = c^k, where c = x and k = 1. Therefore, we have:
(2y + 1)(2y - 1) = (a^3)(b^3)
4y^2 - 1 = a^3b^3

Now, we can substitute y = (a^3 + 1)/2 into the equation:
4((a^3 + 1)/2)^2 - 1 = a^3b^3
(a^3 + 1)^2 - 1 = a^3b^3
a^6 + 2a^3 + 1 - 1 = a^3b^3
a^6 + 2a^3 = a^3b^3
a^3(a^3 + 2) = a^3b^3

Since a^3 is a perfect cube, we can divide both sides by a^3:
a^3 + 2 = b^3

Now, we have a new equation a^3 + 2 = b^3, where a and b are positive integers.

Step 5: Solve for a and b.
We can see that a = 1 and b = 1 is a solution to the equation a^3 + 2 = b^3. However, we need to find all positive integer solutions.

By inspection, we can see that a = 1 and b = 1 is the only solution to the equation. Therefore, the only positive integer solution to the original equation x^3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1) is x = 1 and y = 0.

Final Answer:
The only positive integer solution to the equation x^3 + 3 = 4y(y + 1) is x = 1 and y = 0.</code></pre>
