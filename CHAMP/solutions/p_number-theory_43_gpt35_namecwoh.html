<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The divisibility rule for 3 states that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. In other words, if you add up all the digits of a number and the resulting sum is divisible by 3, then the original number is also divisible by 3.

For example, let&#x27;s consider the number 246. The sum of its digits is 2 + 4 + 6 = 12. Since 12 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 246 is also divisible by 3.

Similarly, let&#x27;s take the number 1,287. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 8 + 7 = 18. Since 18 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 1,287 is also divisible by 3.

This rule can be applied to larger numbers as well. For instance, let&#x27;s consider the number 12,345. The sum of its digits is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15. Since 15 is divisible by 3, we can conclude that 12,345 is also divisible by 3.

The divisibility rule for 3 is a helpful tool to quickly determine if a number is divisible by 3 without performing the actual division. It can be particularly useful when dealing with larger numbers or when performing mental calculations.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is a fundamental result in number theory, named after the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat. It provides a relationship between prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

The theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is any positive integer not divisible by p, then the remainder when a^p is divided by p is always equal to a raised to the power of (p-1) modulo p. In mathematical notation, it can be written as:

a^p ≡ a (mod p)

Here, the symbol &quot;≡&quot; denotes congruence, meaning that the two numbers have the same remainder when divided by p.

To understand this theorem, let&#x27;s consider an example. Let&#x27;s take the prime number p = 5 and the positive integer a = 2. According to Fermat&#x27;s little theorem, we have:

2^5 ≡ 2 (mod 5)

If we calculate 2^5, we get 32. When we divide 32 by 5, the remainder is 2. Therefore, the congruence holds true.

Fermat&#x27;s little theorem has several important applications in number theory and cryptography. One application is in the field of modular exponentiation, where it allows for efficient computation of large powers of numbers modulo a prime. It is also used in the field of primality testing, where it helps identify prime numbers.

Overall, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem is a powerful result that provides insights into the behavior of prime numbers and modular arithmetic.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if there can be finitely many composite numbers in the given sequence, let&#x27;s analyze the situation.

Let&#x27;s assume that there are finitely many composite numbers in the sequence. This means that at some point, all the numbers in the sequence will be prime.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the number x_n in the sequence. We know that x_n is formed by appending a digit from 0 to 8 to the previous number x_(n-1). 

If x_(n-1) is prime, then we need to show that x_n is also prime. To do this, we can use the given information that if a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a | c.

Let&#x27;s assume that x_n is composite. This means that x_n has a prime factor, let&#x27;s call it p. Since x_n is formed by appending a digit to x_(n-1), we can write x_n as:

x_n = 10 * x_(n-1) + d

where d is the digit appended to x_(n-1).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the prime factorization of x_n:

x_n = p * q

where p is a prime factor of x_n and q is the remaining factor.

Since x_n = 10 * x_(n-1) + d, we can rewrite the equation as:

10 * x_(n-1) + d = p * q

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation modulo p:

10 * x_(n-1) + d ≡ 0 (mod p)

Since gcd(p, 10) = 1 (because p is a prime number and 10 does not have p as a factor), we can apply the given information that if a | bc and gcd(a, b) = 1, then a | c. This implies that p | x_(n-1).

However, this contradicts our assumption that x_(n-1) is prime. Therefore, our assumption that x_n is composite must be false.

Since we have shown that if x_(n-1) is prime, then x_n must also be prime, it follows that if there are infinitely many numbers in the sequence, there must be infinitely many prime numbers.

Therefore, there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the given sequence.</code></pre>
