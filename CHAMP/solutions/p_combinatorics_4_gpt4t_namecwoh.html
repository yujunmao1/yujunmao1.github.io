<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A one-to-one mapping p: {1, 2, ..., n}-&gt;{1, 2, ..., n} is called an involution, if p∘p=identity (i.e., p(p(i))=i for all i∈{1, ..., n}). Find the number of involutions on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the number of involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we need to consider the different ways in which elements can map to themselves or to each other in pairs such that applying the mapping twice returns each element to its original position.

An involution on a set can be thought of as a permutation where each element is either a fixed point (maps to itself) or part of a 2-cycle (swaps with another element). For the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can have:

1. No fixed points and three 2-cycles.
2. Two fixed points and two 2-cycles.
3. Four fixed points and one 2-cycle.
4. All six fixed points.

Let&#x27;s count the number of involutions for each case:

1. No fixed points and three 2-cycles:
We have 6 elements to form 2-cycles. The first 2-cycle can be chosen in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways. After choosing the first 2-cycle, we have 4 elements left, and we can choose the second 2-cycle in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways. Finally, the last 2-cycle is determined by the remaining 2 elements. However, we have overcounted because the order in which we select the 2-cycles does not matter (they are indistinguishable). There are 3! ways to arrange 3 2-cycles, so we must divide by 3! to correct for overcounting.

The number of ways to form three 2-cycles is:
\[ \frac{\binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2}}{3!} = \frac{15 \cdot 6 \cdot 1}{6} = 15 \]

2. Two fixed points and two 2-cycles:
First, choose the two fixed points in \( \binom{6}{2} \) ways. Then, with the remaining 4 elements, form two 2-cycles. The first 2-cycle can be chosen in \( \binom{4}{2} \) ways, and the second 2-cycle is determined by the remaining 2 elements. Again, we have overcounted because the order of the 2-cycles does not matter, so we divide by 2!.

The number of ways to have two fixed points and two 2-cycles is:
\[ \binom{6}{2} \cdot \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{2!} = 15 \cdot \frac{6}{2} = 15 \cdot 3 = 45 \]

3. Four fixed points and one 2-cycle:
Choose the four fixed points in \( \binom{6}{4} \) ways, and the remaining 2 elements will form the 2-cycle.

The number of ways to have four fixed points and one 2-cycle is:
\[ \binom{6}{4} = 15 \]

4. All six fixed points:
There is only 1 way for all elements to be fixed points, which is the identity permutation.

Adding up the number of involutions for each case, we get the total number of involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}:
\[ 15 + 45 + 15 + 1 = 76 \]

Therefore, there are 76 involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.</code></pre>
