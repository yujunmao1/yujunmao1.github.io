<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are the basic rules and concepts of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers `a` and `b` are said to be congruent modulo `n` if their difference `a - b` is an integer multiple of `n`. This is denoted as `a ≡ b (mod n)`. For example, 38 is congruent to 14 modulo 12 because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n)`.
- Subtraction: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n)`.
- Multiplication: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n)`.

3. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. An integer `a` can be divided by an integer `b` modulo `n` if there exists an integer `b&#x27;` such that `b * b&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. The integer `b&#x27;` is called the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `n`. If such a `b&#x27;` exists, then `a / b ≡ a * b&#x27; (mod n)`.

4. Modular Inverses:
An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if there exists an integer `a&#x27;` such that `a * a&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Not every integer has a modular inverse. An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if and only if `a` and `n` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

5. Properties:
- The set of integers modulo `n` forms a complete set of residues from `0` to `n-1`. Any integer is congruent to exactly one of these residues.
- Modular arithmetic preserves the usual properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The distributive law holds in modular arithmetic: `a * (b + c) ≡ (a * b) + (a * c) (mod n)`.

6. Applications:
Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is essential for algorithms involving hashing, pseudo-random number generation, and for the arithmetic of large numbers as in RSA encryption.

Understanding these rules allows you to perform arithmetic computations with integers in a modular system, which can be visualized as a circle with `n` points, where `n` is the modulus. When you reach the `n`-th point, you wrap around back to zero, much like the hours on a clock.</code></pre>

2. If ab | c, then a | c and b | c.
3. Find a mod 27 and a mod 73.
4. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest positive integer `a` such that `1971 | 50^n + 23^n * a` for odd `n`, we can use the given information and the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, we note that `1971 = 27 * 73`, and since `1971` divides `50^n + 23^n * a`, both `27` and `73` must divide `50^n + 23^n * a`.

Let&#x27;s consider `50^n + 23^n * a` modulo `27` and `73` separately.

**Modulo 27:**

Since `gcd(27, 50) = 1` and `gcd(27, 23) = 1`, we know that `50^n` and `23^n` are not divisible by `27` for any `n`. We need to find `a` such that `23^n * a` is congruent to `-50^n` modulo `27`.

For odd `n`, `50` is congruent to `23` modulo `27` because `50 ≡ 23 (mod 27)`. Therefore, `50^n ≡ 23^n (mod 27)` for odd `n`.

We want to find `a` such that `23^n * a ≡ -23^n (mod 27)`. Simplifying, we get `a ≡ -1 (mod 27)`. The smallest positive integer `a` that satisfies this is `a = 26` modulo `27`.

**Modulo 73:**

Similarly, since `gcd(73, 50) = 1` and `gcd(73, 23) = 1`, we know that `50^n` and `23^n` are not divisible by `73` for any `n`. We need to find `a` such that `23^n * a` is congruent to `-50^n` modulo `73`.

For odd `n`, `50^n` is not congruent to `23^n` modulo `73`. We need to find the actual values of `50^n` and `23^n` modulo `73` for odd `n`. Since `n` is odd, we can consider `n = 1` to find the values modulo `73`.

`50^1 ≡ 50 (mod 73)`
`23^1 ≡ 23 (mod 73)`

We want to find `a` such that `23 * a ≡ -50 (mod 73)`. Since `73 - 50 = 23`, we have `23 * a ≡ 23 (mod 73)`. Simplifying, we get `a ≡ 1 (mod 73)`.

The smallest positive integer `a` that satisfies this is `a = 1` modulo `73`.

**Combining the results:**

We now have two congruences for `a`:
`a ≡ 26 (mod 27)`
`a ≡ 1 (mod 73)`

To find the smallest positive integer `a` that satisfies both congruences, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem or simply search for the value by testing multiples of `73` and checking when it is one less than a multiple of `27`.

Starting with `y = 0` and incrementing `y`, we have:
`a = 73 * y + 1`

We want to find the smallest `y` such that `73 * y + 1` is congruent to `26` modulo `27`. We can test values of `y`:

For `y = 0`, `a = 73 * 0 + 1 = 1`, which is not congruent to `26` modulo `27`.
