<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} as defined by the recurrence relations:

x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n,
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n,
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n.

We are interested in the behavior of the sequence {w_n}, which is the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n at each step, and specifically, we want to know about w_200.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1. Since they are positive, we can see that each subsequent term in the sequences will also be positive because the recurrence relations involve addition and division by positive numbers, which will always yield positive results.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the growth of the sequences. If at any point, one of the terms, say x_n, is significantly larger than the other two, then in the next step, y_(n+1) will also become large because it is the sum of a large number (z_n) and the reciprocal of a positive number (1/x_n). Similarly, z_(n+1) will become large because it is the sum of a large number (x_n) and the reciprocal of a positive number (1/y_n). This suggests that the sequences have a tendency to &quot;balance out&quot; because a large term in one sequence leads to large terms in the others.

However, this balancing effect does not necessarily mean that the sequences are bounded. To determine whether w_200 is always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20, we would need to analyze the sequences further.

One approach to gain insight into the behavior of the sequences is to simulate the sequences for a large number of initial conditions and observe the behavior of w_n. However, without a clear pattern or a closed-form solution, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about w_200 for all possible initial conditions.

Another approach is to look for invariants or conserved quantities. If we can find a function of x_n, y_n, and z_n that remains constant or has a known behavior as n increases, we might be able to use it to bound w_n.

Unfortunately, without additional information or a more detailed analysis, we cannot conclusively determine the behavior of w_200 for all initial conditions. The problem as stated is open-ended and may require a deeper investigation into the dynamics of the system defined by the recurrence relations.

In conclusion, based on the information provided and the analysis above, we cannot determine whether w_200 is always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20 for different values of x_1, y_1, z_1. Further mathematical tools or computational simulations would be required to explore the behavior of these sequences in more detail.</code></pre>
