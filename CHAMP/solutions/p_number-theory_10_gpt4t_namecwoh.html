<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic, often referred to as &quot;clock arithmetic,&quot; is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are the basic rules and concepts of modular arithmetic:

1. Congruence Modulo n:
Two integers `a` and `b` are said to be congruent modulo `n` if their difference `a - b` is an integer multiple of `n`. This is denoted as `a ≡ b (mod n)`. For example, 38 is congruent to 14 modulo 12 because 38 - 14 = 24, which is a multiple of 12.

2. Arithmetic Operations:
- Addition: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n)`.
- Subtraction: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n)`.
- Multiplication: If `a ≡ b (mod n)` and `c ≡ d (mod n)`, then `(a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n)`.

3. Division:
Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. An integer `a` can be divided by an integer `b` modulo `n` if there exists an integer `b&#x27;` such that `b * b&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. The integer `b&#x27;` is called the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `n`. If such a `b&#x27;` exists, then `a / b ≡ a * b&#x27; (mod n)`.

4. Modular Inverses:
An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if there exists an integer `a&#x27;` such that `a * a&#x27; ≡ 1 (mod n)`. Not every integer has a modular inverse. An integer `a` has a modular inverse modulo `n` if and only if `a` and `n` are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

5. Properties:
- The set of integers modulo `n` forms a complete set of residues from `0` to `n-1`. Any integer is congruent to exactly one of these residues.
- Modular arithmetic preserves the usual properties of equivalence relations: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
- The distributive law holds in modular arithmetic: `a * (b + c) ≡ (a * b) + (a * c) (mod n)`.

6. Applications:
Modular arithmetic is widely used in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. It is essential for algorithms involving hashing, pseudo-random number generation, and for the arithmetic of large numbers as in RSA encryption.

Understanding these rules allows you to perform arithmetic computations with integers in a modular system, which can be visualized as a circle with `n` points, where `n` is the modulus. When you reach the `n`-th point, you wrap around back to zero, much like the hours on a clock.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let (x, y, z) be an integer-valued solution to the equation x^2+y^2=z^2. At least how many of the three numbers must be divisible by 5?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use modular arithmetic to analyze the possible remainders when `x`, `y`, and `z` are divided by 5. We know that any integer squared will have a remainder of either 0, 1, or 4 when divided by 5, because:

- If an integer is divisible by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k for some integer k), then its square is also divisible by 5, and the remainder is 0.
- If an integer has a remainder of 1 or 4 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k+1 or 5k+4), then its square has a remainder of 1 when divided by 5 because (5k+1)^2 = 25k^2 + 10k + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 5) and (5k+4)^2 = 25k^2 + 40k + 16 ≡ 1 (mod 5).
- If an integer has a remainder of 2 or 3 when divided by 5 (i.e., it has the form 5k+2 or 5k+3), then its square has a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 because (5k+2)^2 = 25k^2 + 20k + 4 ≡ 4 (mod 5) and (5k+3)^2 = 25k^2 + 30k + 9 ≡ 4 (mod 5).

Now, let&#x27;s consider the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2 modulo 5:

- If x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5), then x is divisible by 5.
- If y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5), then y is divisible by 5.
- If z^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5), then z is divisible by 5.

We want to find out the minimum number of variables among x, y, and z that must be divisible by 5.

Let&#x27;s consider the possible cases for the squares of x and y modulo 5:

1. If neither x^2 nor y^2 is divisible by 5, then they must both be congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5. However, the sum of two such numbers cannot be a square number that is divisible by 5, because the sum would be 2, 5, or 8 modulo 5, none of which are square numbers modulo 5.

2. If exactly one of x^2 or y^2 is divisible by 5, then without loss of generality, let&#x27;s say x^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5). This means x is divisible by 5. However, for y^2, which is not divisible by 5, it must be congruent to 1 or 4 modulo 5. In this case, y^2 + x^2 ≡ 1 or 4 (mod 5), which cannot be a square number modulo 5 because z^2 must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 5.

3. If both x^2 and y^2 are divisible by 5, then x^2 + y^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5), which implies that z^2 ≡ 0 (mod 5) and hence z is divisible by 5.

From these cases, we can conclude that it is not possible for none or only one of x, y, and z to be divisible by 5. Therefore, at least two of the numbers must be divisible by 5. However, if two of them are divisible by 5, the third must also be divisible by 5 because the sum of two squares that are divisible by 5 will also be divisible by 5.

Therefore, the final answer is that all three numbers, x, y, and z, must be divisible by 5.</code></pre>
