<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer a, so that 1971 | 50^n+23^n*a for odd n.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 1971=27*73, we need 27 | 50^n+23^n*a and 73 | 50^n+23^n*a.
2. We have 50^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n+23^n*a mod 27=23^n*(a+1) mod 27=0.
3. In addition, for odd n, we have 50^n+23^n*a mod 73=(-23)^n+23^n*a mod 73=23^n*(a-1) mod 73=0.
4. Since gcd(27, 23)=gcd(73, 23)=1, we must have gcd(27, 23^n)=gcd(73, 23^n)=1, so 27 | a+1 and 73 | a-1.
5. In other words, a mod 27=-1 and a mod 73=1.
6. Thus, a=27x-1=73y+1 and 27 | 73y+2.
7. We have 73 mod 27=19, so the sequence of 73y+2 mod 27, starting for y=1, 2, 3, ... is 21, 13, 5, 24, 16, 8, 0.
8. We have 27 | 73y+2 for y=7, and a=73y+2=512.
9. Thus, a=512.

Problem: Factorize x^9+x^4-x-1 into terms of integer coefficients.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^9+x^4-x-1=(x^9-x)+(x^4-1)=x(x^8-1)+(x^4-1)=x(x^4+1)(x^4-1)+(x^4-1)=(x^4-1)(x^5+x+1)=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^5+x+1).
2. To factorize x^5+x+1, we have x^5+x+1=(x^5-x^2)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x^3-1)+(x^2+x+1)=x^2*(x-1)(x^2+x+1)+(x^2+x+1)=(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).
3. Thus, x^9+x^4-x-1=(x+1)(x-1)(x^2+1)(x^3-x^2+1)(x^2+x+1).

Problem: Find the smallest positive integer with the property that, if you move the first digit to the end, the new number is exactly 1.5 times as large as the old one.
Step-wise solution:
1. We let d be the first digit of the k+1 digit number and r be the last k digits.
2. Thus, the original number is 10^k*d+r and the new number is 10r+d.
3. So we have 10r+d=3*(10^k*d+r)/2.
4. Simplifying, we get (3*10^k-2)d=17r.
5. Since d is between 1 and 9 and 17 ∤ d, we must have 17 | 3*10^k-2.
6. This means 10^k mod 17=12.
7. Starting from k=1, the sequence of modulo values is 10, 15, 14, 4, 6, 9, 5, 16, 7, 2, 3, 13, 11, 8, 12.
8. Thus, the smallest value is k=15.
9. We let d=1, and get r=(3*10^15-2)/17.
10. Thus, the number is 10^k*d+r=(20*10^15-2)/17.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n, we need to consider the properties of powers of 12 and 5. Since we are looking for the smallest absolute difference, we should start by examining the cases where m and n are small.

Let&#x27;s start with the base cases:

For m = 1 and n = 1:
|12^1 - 5^1| = |12 - 5| = 7

For m = 1 and n = 2:
|12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13

For m = 2 and n = 1:
|12^2 - 5^1| = |144 - 5| = 139

These are not particularly small, and as m and n increase, the values of 12^m and 5^n will diverge rapidly, leading to larger absolute differences. However, we can&#x27;t be sure we&#x27;ve found the smallest value without further investigation.

We can also note that if 12^m is just slightly larger than 5^n, then |12^m - 5^n| will be small. This suggests that we should look for m and n such that 12^m is just over a power of 5, or 5^n is just over a power of 12.

Let&#x27;s try to find a pattern by examining the powers of 12 and 5:

12^1 = 12
12^2 = 144
12^3 = 1728
...

5^1 = 5
5^2 = 25
5^3 = 125
5^4 = 625
5^5 = 3125
...

We are looking for a pair (m, n) such that 12^m is just slightly larger or smaller than 5^n. We can see that 12^2 = 144 is close to 5^3 = 125, but the difference is |144 - 125| = 19, which is larger than our smallest difference so far (7).

Continuing this process, we can look for other close pairs:

12^3 = 1728 is not close to any small power of 5.
5^4 = 625 is not particularly close to a small power of 12.
5^5 = 3125 is close to 12^3 = 1728, but the difference is |3125 - 1728| = 1397, which is quite large.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that the powers of 12 grow much faster than the powers of 5, so we should focus on cases where m is small.

Let&#x27;s try to find a systematic way to approach this. We want to find m and n such that:

12^m ≈ 5^n or 12^m - 5^n ≈ 0

Taking logarithms to base 10 can help us find such m and n:

m * log(12) ≈ n * log(5)

Now we can look for rational approximations of log(12)/log(5), which will give us ratios of m to n that are close to this value.

log(12)/log(5) ≈ 1.27875...

We can use continued fractions or other methods to find good rational approximations for this number. However, since we are looking for small values of m and n, we can simply try small integer values and see if we get close.

For example, if we try m = 1 and n = 1, we get:

log(12)/log(5) ≈ 1/1 = 1, which is not very close.

If we try m = 2 and n = 3, we get:

log(12)/log(5) ≈ 2/3 ≈ 0.666..., which is closer.

This suggests that m = 2 and n = 3 might give us a small value for |12^m - 5^n|. Indeed, we already calculated this to be |144 - 125| = 19.

To find the smallest value, we would need to continue this process, trying different small values of m and n, until we find the smallest |12^m - 5^n|. However, without a more systematic approach or computational aid, this process could be quite lengthy.

Given the information we have so far, the smallest value we have found is |12^1 - 5^1| = 7. Without further exploration or computational tools, we cannot definitively say this is the smallest possible value, but it is the smallest we have encountered in our manual calculations.</code></pre>
