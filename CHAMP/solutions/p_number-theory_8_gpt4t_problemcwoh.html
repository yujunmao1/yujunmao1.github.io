<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find all positive integer solutions to the equation x^3+3=4y(y+1).
Step-wise solution:
1. We have x^3=4y^2+4y+1-4=(2y+1)^2-2^2=(2y+3)(2y-1).
2. gcd(2y+3, 2y-1)=gcd(2y+3-(2y-1), 2y-1)=gcd(4, 2y-1)=1 since 4 only has prime factor of 2 and 2y-1 is odd.
3. Thus, we have 2y+3=u^3 and 2y-1=v^3 with gcd(u,v)=1 and u,v≥1.
4. This means that u^3-v^3=4, but u^3-v^3=(u-v)(u^2+uv+v^2), which is at least 7 (for u=2, v=1).
5. Thus, the original equation has no solution.

Problem: Let x_1=1 and x_(n+1)=1+n/x_n. For how many values of x_1, ..., x_100 do we have the inequality sqrt(i)≤x_i≤sqrt(i)+1?
Step-wise solution:
1. We see that x_1 satisfies the condition.
2. Assume that x_n satisfies the condition, then we know that x_(n+1)=1+n/x_n≤1+n/sqrt(n)=1+sqrt(n)≤sqrt(n+1)+1.
3. In addition, x_(n+1)=1+n/x_n≥1+n/(sqrt(n)+1)≥1+(n+1-1)/(sqrt(n+1)+1)=1+sqrt(n+1)-1=sqrt(n+1).
4. Thus, we have sqrt(n+1)≤x_(n+1)≤sqrt(n+1)+1, which means that x_(n+1) also satisifies the inequality for all n.
5. So all 100 values of x_i satisfy the condition.

Problem: Find all integer solutions to the equation x(x+1)=y^z for x&gt;0, y&gt;0, z&gt;1.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since gcd(x, x+1)=gcd(x, 1)=1, we have x=u^z, x+1=v^z with gcd(u, v)=1 and u,v≥1.
2. However, this means v^z-u^z=1.
3. Since v^z-u^z=(v-u)(v^(z-1)+v^(z-2)*u+...+v*u^(z-2)+u^(z-1)) and the second factor has at least 2 terms, the difference must be greater than 1.
4. So the equation has no solution.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1)=a^m for integer n, a&gt;0 and m&gt;1.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. If gcd(a, b)=gcd(a, c)=1, then gcd(a, bc)=1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1, we will use the fact that n-1, n, and n+1 are three consecutive integers. Therefore, they are pairwise coprime, meaning that any two of them have a greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1.

Let&#x27;s analyze the equation:

(n-1)n(n+1) = a^m

Since n-1, n, and n+1 are three consecutive integers, we can say that:

gcd(n-1, n) = 1
gcd(n, n+1) = 1
gcd(n-1, n+1) = 1

This implies that n-1, n, and n+1 must each be a power of a, since a^m is a prime power and the three factors on the left-hand side are pairwise coprime. Let&#x27;s denote:

n-1 = a^i
n = a^j
n+1 = a^k

Where i, j, and k are non-negative integers and at least one of them must be zero since they are consecutive integers. However, since n &gt; 0 and a &gt; 0, we cannot have n = a^0 = 1, so j cannot be zero. This leaves us with two possibilities:

1. i = 0, which means n-1 = 1, so n = 2. But then n+1 = 3 is not a power of a, so this case is not possible.
2. k = 0, which means n+1 = 1, so n = 0. But this contradicts the condition that n &gt; 0.

Since neither case is possible, we must consider the possibility that one of the terms is a^m itself, and the other two must be 1 because they are coprime to a^m and to each other. This leads us to the following cases:

Case 1: n = a^m
In this case, n-1 and n+1 must both be 1, which is impossible since they are consecutive integers.

Case 2: n-1 = a^m
In this case, n and n+1 must both be 1, which is again impossible.

Case 3: n+1 = a^m
In this case, n and n-1 must both be 1, which is impossible.

Since none of these cases yield a valid solution, we must consider the possibility that a^m is the product of two or all three of the consecutive integers. Since the three integers are consecutive and pairwise coprime, the only way they can multiply to a^m is if one of them is a^m and the others are 1, which we have already shown is impossible.

Therefore, there are no integer solutions to the equation (n-1)n(n+1) = a^m for integer n, a &gt; 0, and m &gt; 1.</code></pre>
