<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. The rule of sum is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are two or more mutually exclusive events or scenarios.

Mutually exclusive events are those that cannot occur at the same time; in other words, the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. The rule of sum states that if one event can occur in \(m\) ways and another event can occur in \(n\) ways, and the two events cannot occur simultaneously, then there are \(m + n\) ways for either of the events to occur.

Here&#x27;s a simple example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you have a menu with 3 different appetizers and 4 different desserts. If you want to choose either an appetizer or a dessert, but not both, the rule of sum tells you that there are \(3 + 4 = 7\) different choices you can make.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the choices are mutually exclusive. If it were possible to choose both an appetizer and a dessert, then you would need to use a different combinatorial principle, such as the rule of product, to find the total number of combinations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 5 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors (i.e., the string does not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings).

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach that involves breaking down the problem into cases and applying the rule of sum.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid strings of length \(n\) that end with a 1 as \(A_n\), the number that end with a 2 as \(B_n\), the number that end with a 3 as \(C_n\), and the number that end with a 4 as \(D_n\). We want to find the total number of valid strings of length 5, which is \(A_5 + B_5 + C_5 + D_5\).

First, let&#x27;s consider strings of length 1:
- \(A_1 = 1\) (the string is &quot;1&quot;)
- \(B_1 = 1\) (the string is &quot;2&quot;)
- \(C_1 = 1\) (the string is &quot;3&quot;)
- \(D_1 = 1\) (the string is &quot;4&quot;)

For strings of length 2, we can&#x27;t have a 1 followed by a 2 or a 2 followed by a 1. So:
- \(A_2\) can be formed by adding a 1 to any string of length 1 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(A_2 = C_1 + D_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\).
- \(B_2\) can be formed by adding a 2 to any string of length 1 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(B_2 = C_1 + D_1 = 1 + 1 = 2\).
- \(C_2\) can be formed by adding a 3 to any string of length 1, so \(C_2 = A_1 + B_1 + C_1 + D_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\).
- \(D_2\) can be formed by adding a 4 to any string of length 1, so \(D_2 = A_1 + B_1 + C_1 + D_1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\).

For strings of length 3, we continue the pattern:
- \(A_3\) can be formed by adding a 1 to any string of length 2 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(A_3 = C_2 + D_2 = 4 + 4 = 8\).
- \(B_3\) can be formed by adding a 2 to any string of length 2 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(B_3 = C_2 + D_2 = 4 + 4 = 8\).
- \(C_3\) can be formed by adding a 3 to any string of length 2, so \(C_3 = A_2 + B_2 + C_2 + D_2 = 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 12\).
- \(D_3\) can be formed by adding a 4 to any string of length 2, so \(D_3 = A_2 + B_2 + C_2 + D_2 = 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 12\).

For strings of length 4:
- \(A_4\) can be formed by adding a 1 to any string of length 3 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(A_4 = C_3 + D_3 = 12 + 12 = 24\).
- \(B_4\) can be formed by adding a 2 to any string of length 3 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(B_4 = C_3 + D_3 = 12 + 12 = 24\).
- \(C_4\) can be formed by adding a 3 to any string of length 3, so \(C_4 = A_3 + B_3 + C_3 + D_3 = 8 + 8 + 12 + 12 = 40\).
- \(D_4\) can be formed by adding a 4 to any string of length 3, so \(D_4 = A_3 + B_3 + C_3 + D_3 = 8 + 8 + 12 + 12 = 40\).

Finally, for strings of length 5:
- \(A_5\) can be formed by adding a 1 to any string of length 4 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(A_5 = C_4 + D_4 = 40 + 40 = 80\).
- \(B_5\) can be formed by adding a 2 to any string of length 4 that ends with 3 or 4, so \(B_5 = C_4 + D_4 = 40 + 40 = 80\).
- \(C_5\) can be formed by adding a 3 to any string of length 4, so \(C_5 = A_4 + B_4 + C_4 + D_4 = 24 + 24 + 40 + 40 = 128\).
- \(D_5\) can be formed by adding a 4 to any string of length 4, so \(D_5 = A_4 + B_4 + C_4 + D_4 = 24 + 24 + 40 + 40 = 128\).

The total number of valid strings of length 5 is \(A_5 + B_5 + C_5 + D_5 = 80 + 80 + 128 + 128 = 416\).

Therefore, there are 416 strings of length 5 consisting of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that do not have a 1 and 2 as neighbors.</code></pre>
