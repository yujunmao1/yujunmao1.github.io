<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The equation you&#x27;ve provided is an example of a difference of squares, which is a factored form of a quadratic expression. The difference of squares formula states that for any two terms x and y:

x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)

To apply this concept, let&#x27;s take specific values for x and y. For example, let&#x27;s choose x = 5 and y = 3. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

(5)^2 - (3)^2 = (5 + 3)(5 - 3)

Now, calculate each part:

25 - 9 = 8 * 2

16 = 16

As you can see, both sides of the equation are equal, which confirms that the difference of squares formula has been applied correctly.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>These are modular arithmetic properties, which are very useful in various fields such as cryptography, computer science, and number theory. Let&#x27;s apply these concepts with specific numbers.

Let&#x27;s choose:
- a = 10
- b = 4
- m = 5
- k = 3 (for the exponentiation example)

Now, we&#x27;ll apply each of the modular arithmetic properties one by one.

1. Addition:
(a + b) mod m = ((a mod m) + (b mod m)) mod m

(10 + 4) mod 5 = ((10 mod 5) + (4 mod 5)) mod 5
14 mod 5 = (0 + 4) mod 5
4 = 4 mod 5
4 = 4

Both sides are equal, confirming the property for addition.

2. Subtraction:
(a - b) mod m = ((a mod m) - (b mod m)) mod m

(10 - 4) mod 5 = ((10 mod 5) - (4 mod 5)) mod 5
6 mod 5 = (0 - 4) mod 5
1 = (-4 mod 5) mod 5
1 = 1 mod 5
1 = 1

Both sides are equal, confirming the property for subtraction.

3. Multiplication:
(ab) mod m = ((a mod m) * (b mod m)) mod m

(10 * 4) mod 5 = ((10 mod 5) * (4 mod 5)) mod 5
40 mod 5 = (0 * 4) mod 5
0 = 0 mod 5
0 = 0

Both sides are equal, confirming the property for multiplication.

4. Exponentiation:
a^k mod m = ((a mod m)^k mod m)

10^3 mod 5 = ((10 mod 5)^3 mod m)
1000 mod 5 = (0^3 mod 5)
0 = 0 mod 5
0 = 0

Both sides are equal, confirming the property for exponentiation.

In each case, we&#x27;ve confirmed that the modular arithmetic properties hold true for the chosen values of a, b, m, and k. These properties are very powerful and are the foundation of many algorithms in computer science, especially in the field of cryptography.</code></pre>

What is the smallest value of |36^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest positive value of the expression |36^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n. This means we are looking for the smallest difference between a power of 36 and a power of 5.

Since 36 is a power of 6 (36 = 6^2), we can rewrite 36^m as (6^2)^m = 6^(2m). Now, we are looking for the smallest difference between 6^(2m) and 5^n.

Let&#x27;s start by examining small values of m and n to see if we can find a pair that gives us a small difference:

For m = 1 and n = 1:
|36^1 - 5^1| = |36 - 5| = 31

For m = 1 and n = 2:
|36^1 - 5^2| = |36 - 25| = 11

For m = 2 and n = 3:
|36^2 - 5^3| = |1296 - 125| = 1171

We can see that the difference is getting larger for m = 2 and n = 3, so let&#x27;s try to keep m and n small. We can also notice that since 36 is a perfect square, we might want to consider n values that bring 5^n closer to a perfect square.

For m = 1 and n = 3:
|36^1 - 5^3| = |36 - 125| = 89

This is larger than our previous smallest difference, so let&#x27;s try increasing n to 4:

For m = 1 and n = 4:
|36^1 - 5^4| = |36 - 625| = 589

This is even larger. We need to find a power of 5 that is just less than a power of 36 or just more than a power of 36 to minimize the absolute difference.

Let&#x27;s try increasing m to 2:

For m = 2 and n = 4:
|36^2 - 5^4| = |1296 - 625| = 671

This is still not smaller than 11, which is our smallest difference so far. We need to find a power of 5 that is very close to a power of 36. Since 5^2 = 25 is close to 36, let&#x27;s try to find powers of 5 that are close to powers of 36 by looking for powers of 5 that end in a 1 or a 6, as these are the last digits of the powers of 6 (since 6^1 ends in 6, 6^2 ends in 6, and so on).

We can quickly check the powers of 5:

5^1 = 5
5^2 = 25
5^3 = 125
5^4 = 625
5^5 = 3125
5^6 = 15625
...

We notice that 5^3 = 125 ends in a 5, and 6^2 = 36 ends in a 6. The next power of 5 that ends in 5 is 5^6 = 15625, which is close to 6^4 = 1296. Let&#x27;s see if this gives us a smaller difference:

For m = 2 and n = 6:
|36^2 - 5^6| = |1296 - 15625| = 14329

This is much larger. We need to find a closer match. Let&#x27;s try smaller powers again, but this time let&#x27;s look for a power of 5 that ends in 6, as this would indicate it&#x27;s close to a power of 36.

We can see that 5^2 = 25 is close to 36, but we&#x27;ve already tried m = 1. Let&#x27;s try m = 2:

For m = 2 and n = 2:
|36^2 - 5^2| = |1296 - 25| = 1271

This is not smaller than 11. We need to find a closer match. Let&#x27;s try increasing m:

For m = 3 and n = 2:
|36^3 - 5^2| = |46656 - 25| = 46631

This is much larger. It seems that we need to find a power of 5 that is just less than a power of 36 or just more than a power of 36 to minimize the absolute difference.

Let&#x27;s try m = 2 and n = 5:
|36^2 - 5^5| = |1296 - 3125| = 1829

This is still not smaller than 11. We need to find a closer match. Let&#x27;s try increasing m:
