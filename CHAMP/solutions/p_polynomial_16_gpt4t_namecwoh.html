<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: transitivity of divisibility.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept of transitivity of divisibility is a fundamental property in number theory that applies to the divisibility relation among integers. Divisibility is a binary relation that we denote using the symbol &quot;|&quot;. For any two integers a and b, we say that &quot;a divides b&quot; (denoted as a | b) if there exists an integer k such that b = ak. In other words, b is a multiple of a.

The transitivity of divisibility states that if a | b and b | c, then a | c for any integers a, b, and c. This means that if a divides b and b divides c, then a must also divide c.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s look at an example:

Suppose we have three integers a, b, and c such that a | b and b | c. This means there are integers k and m such that:

b = ak (since a | b)
c = bm (since b | c)

Now, if we substitute the expression for b into the equation for c, we get:

c = (ak)m
c = a(km)

Since km is also an integer (because the product of two integers is an integer), we can see that a divides c (a | c), because c is a multiple of a.

This property is very useful in number theory and helps establish the structure of the set of integers with respect to divisibility. It is one of the reasons why divisibility is considered a partial order on the set of integers, as it is reflexive (a | a), antisymmetric (if a | b and b | a, then a = b), and transitive (as we&#x27;ve just discussed).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

The polynomial f(x) has integer coefficients and there exists an integer k such that f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2) are all divisible by 3. For integer m in {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, at least how many of them have f(m) divisible by 3, as an expression of k?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.
2. If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given that f(x) has integer coefficients and f(k), f(k+1), f(k+2) are all divisible by 3, we can use the properties of divisibility to determine how many of the integers in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k} yield f(m) divisible by 3.

First, let&#x27;s use the fact that for integers a, b, n, we have a - b | a^n - b^n. This means that for any integer n, we have:

k - (k+1) | f(k) - f(k+1)
k - (k+2) | f(k) - f(k+2)
(k+1) - (k+2) | f(k+1) - f(k+2)

Since k - (k+1) = -1, k - (k+2) = -2, and (k+1) - (k+2) = -1, and since the difference of two numbers divisible by 3 is also divisible by 3, we can conclude that:

3 | f(k) - f(k+1)
3 | f(k) - f(k+2)
3 | f(k+1) - f(k+2)

Now, let&#x27;s consider the integers m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}. We want to find how many of these integers have f(m) divisible by 3.

We know that f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2) are divisible by 3. Let&#x27;s look at f(k+3):

Since k+3 - k = 3 and k+3 - (k+1) = 2, we have:

3 | f(k+3) - f(k) (because 3 | f(k) and 3 | 3^n - 0^n for any n)
3 | f(k+3) - f(k+1) (because 3 | f(k+1) and 3 | 2^n - 1^n for any n)

From the above, we can deduce that 3 | f(k+3) because it is a linear combination of f(k) and f(k+1), both of which are divisible by 3, and the difference between them is also divisible by 3.

Now, let&#x27;s consider f(k+4):

Since k+4 - k = 4 and k+4 - (k+2) = 2, we have:

3 | f(k+4) - f(k) (because 3 | f(k) and 3 | 4^n - 0^n for any n)
3 | f(k+4) - f(k+2) (because 3 | f(k+2) and 3 | 2^n - 0^n for any n)

Again, we can deduce that 3 | f(k+4) because it is a linear combination of f(k) and f(k+2), both of which are divisible by 3, and the difference between them is also divisible by 3.

Continuing this pattern, we can see that for every integer m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, we can find a similar argument that shows f(m) is divisible by 3. This is because m - k is an integer, and we can always express f(m) as a linear combination of f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2), which are all divisible by 3, and the differences are also divisible by 3 due to the property a - b | a^n - b^n.

Therefore, for every integer m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, f(m) is divisible by 3. The number of such integers is 2k - (k+3) + 1 = k - 2.

So, at least k - 2 of the integers m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k} have f(m) divisible by 3.</code></pre>
