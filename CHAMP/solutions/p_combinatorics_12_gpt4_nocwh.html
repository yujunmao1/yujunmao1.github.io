<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem can be solved using combinatorics and the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

This step is done to simplify the problem. Now, instead of considering a one-way street, we can consider a circular parking lot. This allows us to use cyclic permutations in our calculations.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

The condition is that no car should be parked in the (n+1)-th lot. This is because the (n+1)-th lot is an imaginary lot we added to convert the problem into a circular one. If a car is parked in the (n+1)-th lot, it means that the car couldn&#x27;t find a place in the original n lots, which contradicts the condition that every driver can park.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?

There are (n+1)^n total sequences because each of the n cars can choose any of the (n+1) lots. However, we need to subtract the sequences where at least one car chooses the (n+1)-th lot. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The number of sequences where at least one car chooses the (n+1)-th lot is (n+1)^n - n^n.

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Each sequence {a} has n cyclically shifted versions (including itself). However, not all of them lead to a valid parking configuration. To find the number of valid configurations, we need to divide the total number of sequences by n, because each valid configuration is counted n times due to the cyclic shifts. 

So, the final answer is [(n+1)^n - n^n] / n.</code></pre>
