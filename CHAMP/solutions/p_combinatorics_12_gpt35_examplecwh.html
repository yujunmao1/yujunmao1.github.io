<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich. Suppose we have 3 steps involved in making a sandwich: choosing the type of bread, selecting the filling, and adding toppings. 

Let&#x27;s say there are 2 options for the type of bread (p1 = 2), 3 options for the filling (p2 = 3), and 4 options for the toppings (p3 = 4). 

According to the concept you mentioned, the total number of ways to make a sandwich would be p1 * p2 * p3 = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24.

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to make a sandwich by considering all the possible combinations of bread, filling, and toppings.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s follow the given hints:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By adding the (n+1)-th lot, we can consider the parking lots as a circular arrangement.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

For every driver i, they can park if and only if their favorite parking lot a_i is either empty or the next available lot after a_i is empty.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid sequences of length n as V(n).

4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

For each valid sequence {a}, we can cyclically shift it n times to obtain n different sequences, all of which will lead to a valid parking configuration.

Now, let&#x27;s proceed with the solution:

Consider the first driver. They have n+1 options for their favorite parking lot (from 1 to n+1). If they choose the (n+1)-th lot, then all other drivers can park in their favorite lots, and we have V(n) valid sequences.

If the first driver chooses any other lot from 1 to n, then we need to consider the next driver. The next driver has n options for their favorite parking lot, excluding the one chosen by the first driver. If they choose the (n+1)-th lot, then all other drivers can park in their favorite lots, and we have V(n-1) valid sequences.

Continuing this process, the total number of valid sequences can be expressed as:

V(n) = (n+1) * V(n-1)

We also have the base case:

V(1) = 1

Now, let&#x27;s calculate V(n) using the recursive formula:

V(1) = 1
V(2) = (2+1) * V(1) = 3 * 1 = 3
V(3) = (3+1) * V(2) = 4 * 3 = 12
V(4) = (4+1) * V(3) = 5 * 12 = 60
V(5) = (5+1) * V(4) = 6 * 60 = 360

Therefore, the number of valid sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} is 360 when n = 5.</code></pre>
