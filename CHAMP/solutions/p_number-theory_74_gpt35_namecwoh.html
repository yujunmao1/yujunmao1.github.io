<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic that deals with remainders. It is often used in number theory, cryptography, and computer science. The basic idea is to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a fixed range, called the modulus.

In modular arithmetic, we consider a set of numbers that are congruent to each other modulo a given modulus. Two numbers are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference is divisible by n. This is denoted as a â‰¡ b (mod n), where a and b are the numbers being compared, and n is the modulus.

Modular arithmetic follows a set of rules that govern the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These rules are:

1. Addition: (a + b) mod n = (a mod n + b mod n) mod n
   This rule states that when adding two numbers, we can take the sum of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the sum.

2. Subtraction: (a - b) mod n = (a mod n - b mod n) mod n
   Similar to addition, when subtracting two numbers, we can take the difference of their remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the difference.

3. Multiplication: (a * b) mod n = (a mod n * b mod n) mod n
   For multiplication, we can take the product of the remainders modulo n to get the remainder of the product.

4. Division: (a / b) mod n = (a mod n * b^(-1) mod n) mod n
   Division in modular arithmetic involves finding the modular multiplicative inverse of b (if it exists) and multiplying it with the remainder of a modulo n.

These rules allow us to perform arithmetic operations on numbers within a modulus, which is particularly useful when dealing with cyclic patterns or when working with large numbers in computer algorithms.

For example, let&#x27;s consider modular arithmetic modulo 7. If we want to find the remainder of 23 divided by 7, we can use the division rule:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 7^(-1) mod 7) mod 7
Since 7^(-1) mod 7 = 1, we have:
23 mod 7 = (23 * 1) mod 7 = 23 mod 7 = 2

In this case, the remainder of 23 divided by 7 is 2.</code></pre>

Find all possible positive integer values of x such that x, x+10 and x+14 are all prime numbers.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we need to find all possible values of x such that x, x+10, and x+14 are all prime numbers.

Let&#x27;s start by considering the first condition: x is a prime number. Since we are looking for positive integer values of x, we can start with x = 2, which is the smallest prime number.

Now, let&#x27;s check the second condition: x+10 is a prime number. We can check if x+10 is prime by dividing it by all prime numbers less than or equal to its square root. If it is divisible by any of these primes, then it is not a prime number.

For x = 2, x+10 = 12, which is not a prime number.

Next, let&#x27;s move on to the third condition: x+14 is a prime number. Again, we can check if x+14 is prime by dividing it by all prime numbers less than or equal to its square root.

For x = 2, x+14 = 16, which is not a prime number.

Since x = 2 does not satisfy all three conditions, we need to move on to the next possible value of x.

For x = 3, x+10 = 13, which is a prime number.

For x = 3, x+14 = 17, which is a prime number.

Therefore, x = 3 satisfies all three conditions.

We can continue this process for larger values of x to find all possible solutions.

For x = 5, x+10 = 15, which is not a prime number.

For x = 7, x+10 = 17, which is a prime number.

For x = 11, x+10 = 21, which is not a prime number.

For x = 13, x+10 = 23, which is a prime number.

For x = 17, x+10 = 27, which is not a prime number.

For x = 19, x+10 = 29, which is a prime number.

Therefore, the possible positive integer values of x such that x, x+10, and x+14 are all prime numbers are x = 3, 7, 13, and 19.</code></pre>
