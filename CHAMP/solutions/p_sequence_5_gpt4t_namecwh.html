<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r â‰  1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: difference of squares formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a fundamental identity in algebra that expresses the difference between the squares of two numbers as the product of the sum and the difference of those two numbers. The formula is as follows:

a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)

Here&#x27;s how the formula is derived:

Start with the right-hand side of the equation and expand the product of the two binomials:

(a + b)(a - b) = a(a - b) + b(a - b)
               = a^2 - ab + ab - b^2
               = a^2 - b^2

Notice that the middle terms (-ab and +ab) cancel each other out, leaving us with the difference of the squares of a and b.

The difference of squares formula is particularly useful in factoring quadratic expressions and in simplifying algebraic expressions. It can also be used to solve equations and to perform mental calculations.

For example, if you want to factor the expression x^2 - 9, you can recognize that 9 is the square of 3, and thus write:

x^2 - 9 = x^2 - 3^2 = (x + 3)(x - 3)

This formula is also helpful in solving problems involving squares of large numbers. For instance, if you want to find the difference between the squares of 101 and 99, you can use the formula instead of actually squaring each number:

101^2 - 99^2 = (101 + 99)(101 - 99) = (200)(2) = 400

The difference of squares formula is a simple yet powerful tool in various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and calculus.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Are there prime numbers in the sequence {a_n} with a_1=10001, a_2=100010001, a_3=1000100010001, ... (there are three 0s in between each pair of 1s). If so, what is the smallest one?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. 10001=73*137.
2. For even n, let n+1=m and factorize the expression for a_n.
3. For integer a, b, n, a - b | a^n - b^n.
4. For integer a, b and odd n, a + b | a^n + b^n.
5. For odd n, let n+1=2k and factorize the expression for a_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given the sequence {a_n} with a_1 = 10001, a_2 = 100010001, a_3 = 1000100010001, ..., we want to determine if there are any prime numbers in this sequence.

First, let&#x27;s examine the given information:

1. 10001 = 73 * 137.

This tells us that a_1 is not prime since it can be factored into 73 and 137.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the terms a_n for even and odd n separately, using the provided hints.

For even n (hint 2):
Let n + 1 = m, which means n = m - 1. We can express a_n as a sum of powers of 10:

a_n = 1 * 10^(3(m-1)) + 1 * 10^(2(m-1)) + 1 * 10^(m-1) + 1

Notice that this is a sum of geometric series with the common ratio being 10^(m-1). We can factorize this expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

a_n = (10^(3m) - 1) / (10^(m-1) - 1)

Since m = n + 1 and n is even, m is odd. Therefore, 10^(m-1) - 1 is a difference of squares:

10^(m-1) - 1 = (10^((m-1)/2) + 1)(10^((m-1)/2) - 1)

This means that a_n for even n is not prime because it can be factored further.

For odd n (hint 5):
Let n + 1 = 2k, which means n = 2k - 1. We can express a_n similarly as a sum of powers of 10:

a_n = 1 * 10^(3(2k-1)) + 1 * 10^(2(2k-1)) + 1 * 10^(2k-1) + 1

Again, this is a sum of a geometric series, and we can factorize this expression using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:

a_n = (10^(6k) - 1) / (10^(2k) - 1)

Since 10^(2k) - 1 is a difference of squares, we can factor it as:

10^(2k) - 1 = (10^k + 1)(10^k - 1)

This means that a_n for odd n is also not prime because it can be factored further.

Since both even and odd n lead to factorizable expressions for a_n, we can conclude that there are no prime numbers in the sequence {a_n}. Each term a_n can be factored into smaller integers, and therefore, no term in the sequence is prime. The smallest term we already know is not prime is a_1 = 10001, which is the product of 73 and 137.</code></pre>
