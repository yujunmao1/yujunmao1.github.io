<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. Make the parking lot arrangement a circle, by connecting the n-th lot to a new (n+1)-th lot, which connects back to the 1st lot.
2. Thus, every car will have somewhere to park because there are n cars in the (n+1)-lot circle.
3. In addition, satisfying the original parking configuration is equivalent to the (n+1)-th lot being empty after all cars have parked (because an occupied (n+1)-th lot means that the car on that lot would have left for good originally).
4. Let each driver choose his favorite lot number from 1 to n+1, so there are (n+1)^n sequences.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The following is a solution to the problem:

Let $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ be the sequence of parking lot numbers chosen by the drivers. We can think of this as a permutation of the numbers from 1 to $n+1$. The condition that every driver can park is equivalent to the condition that the permutation is a derangement. A derangement is a permutation of the numbers from 1 to $n$ such that no number appears in its original position.

It is known that the number of derangements of $n$ objects is given by the following formula:

$$D_n = n!\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}$$

Therefore, the number of sequences of parking lot numbers such that every driver can park is given by the following formula:

$$\boxed{(n+1)^n \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!}}$$

Here is a proof of the formula for the number of derangements. Let $S_n$ be the set of all permutations of the numbers from 1 to $n$. For each permutation $\pi \in S_n$, let $f(\pi)$ be the number of fixed points of $\pi$, i.e., the number of numbers that appear in their original position in $\pi$. Then, we have the following identity:

$$\sum_{\pi \in S_n} f(\pi) = n!$$

This is because each number from 1 to $n$ appears in exactly one permutation of $S_n$, and the number of fixed points of that permutation is the number of times that number appears in its original position.

Now, let $D_n$ be the number of derangements of $n$ objects. Then, we have the following identity:

$$\sum_{\pi \in S_n} (-1)^{f(\pi)} = D_n$$

This is because a permutation is a derangement if and only if it has no fixed points.

We can rewrite the above identity as follows:

$$\sum_{\pi \in S_n} (-1)^{f(\pi)} = \sum_{\pi \in S_n} \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \binom{n}{k}$$

where $\binom{n}{k}$ is the binomial coefficient.

The inner sum is equal to $1$ if $k=0$ and $0$ otherwise. Therefore, we have the following identity:

$$D_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{(-1)^k}{k!} \binom{n}{k}$$

This is the formula for the number of derangements.</code></pre>
