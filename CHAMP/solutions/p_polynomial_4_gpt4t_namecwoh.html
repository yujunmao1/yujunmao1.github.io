<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: geometric progression sum formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>A geometric progression (also known as a geometric sequence) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, ... is a geometric progression with a common ratio of 3.

The sum of the first n terms of a geometric progression can be calculated using the geometric progression sum formula. This formula is particularly useful when the number of terms n is large, making it impractical to add all terms individually.

The sum S_n of the first n terms of a geometric progression with the first term a and common ratio r (where r ≠ 1) is given by:

S_n = a(1 - r^n) / (1 - r)

Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the formula:

- a is the first term of the sequence.
- r is the common ratio.
- n is the number of terms to be summed.
- S_n is the sum of the first n terms.

The formula is derived from the fact that each term in the sequence can be expressed as a geometric power of r. When you add up all the terms, you can factor out the common terms and simplify the expression to the formula above.

If the common ratio r is equal to 1, then every term in the sequence is the same as the first term a, and the sum of the first n terms is simply:

S_n = a * n

This is because each term in the sequence is just a, and there are n such terms.

It&#x27;s important to note that the formula for the sum of a geometric progression only applies when the absolute value of the common ratio |r| is not equal to 1. If |r| is greater than 1, the sum grows without bound as n increases. If |r| is less than 1, the sum approaches a finite limit as n approaches infinity, which leads to the concept of the sum to infinity for a geometric series:

S_infinity = a / (1 - r)

This formula gives the sum of all terms in an infinite geometric progression where |r| &lt; 1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine for how many values of \( n \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\} \) the polynomial \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root, we need to analyze the given polynomial and its properties.

The polynomial \( P(x) \) is defined as:

\[ P(x) = x^{2n} - 2x^{2n-1} + 3x^{2n-2} - 4x^{2n-3} + \ldots - 2nx + 2n + 1 \]

This polynomial is of degree \( 2n \), and the coefficients of the terms alternate in sign. The constant term is \( 2n + 1 \), which is always positive for \( n \geq 1 \).

By Descartes&#x27; Rule of Signs, the number of positive real roots of a polynomial is either equal to the number of sign changes between consecutive nonzero coefficients or is less than that by an even number. Since the coefficients alternate in sign, there are \( 2n - 1 \) sign changes, which means there could be \( 2n - 1 \), \( 2n - 3 \), ..., 3, or 1 positive real roots.

However, we are interested in whether there is at least one real-valued root, not necessarily positive. To ensure that there is at least one real root, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. If we can find two values of \( x \), say \( a \) and \( b \), such that \( P(a) \) and \( P(b) \) have opposite signs, then there must be at least one real root between \( a \) and \( b \).

Let&#x27;s evaluate \( P(x) \) at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \):

\[ P(0) = 2n + 1 \]
\[ P(1) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \ldots - 2n + 2n + 1 \]

Notice that \( P(0) = 2n + 1 \) is always positive. Now, let&#x27;s look at \( P(1) \). The sum of the series at \( x = 1 \) is the sum of an arithmetic series with alternating signs:

\[ P(1) = 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + \ldots + (-1)^{2n-1} \cdot 2n + 2n + 1 \]

To find \( P(1) \), we can pair the terms:

\[ (1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \ldots + ((-1)^{2n-1} \cdot 2n + 2n) + 1 \]
\[ = -1 - 1 - \ldots - 1 + 1 \]
\[ = -n + 1 \]

So, \( P(1) = -n + 1 \). Since \( n \) is a positive integer, \( P(1) \) is negative for all \( n \geq 2 \). Therefore, for \( n \geq 2 \), \( P(0) \) is positive and \( P(1) \) is negative, which means by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there is at least one real root between 0 and 1 for each \( n \geq 2 \).

For \( n = 1 \), the polynomial becomes:

\[ P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 3 \]

This is a quadratic polynomial with a positive leading coefficient and a positive constant term. The discriminant of this quadratic is \( \Delta = (-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 4 - 12 = -8 \), which is negative, indicating that there are no real roots when \( n = 1 \).

Therefore, for \( n \in \{2, 3, \ldots, 100\} \), \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root, which gives us \( 100 - 1 = 99 \) values of \( n \) for which \( P(x) \) has at least one real-valued root.</code></pre>
