<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.

In simple terms, the rule of sum states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m + n ways to do either one of those things.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt or one pair of pants, you can use the rule of sum.

According to the rule of sum, you add the number of choices for each mutually exclusive event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 + 2 = 5.

To generalize the rule of sum, if you have k mutually exclusive events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the sum of all the options: m1 + m2 + m3 + ... + mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum assumes that the events or choices are mutually exclusive, meaning that you can only choose one option from each event. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of product or inclusion-exclusion principle may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of sum is a fundamental principle in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when there are multiple mutually exclusive choices or events.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

From the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}, select triple (x, y, z), with duplicate allowed, such that z&gt;max(x, y). In how many ways can this be done, as an expression of n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the number of ways to choose the triple when z=i.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s consider the number of ways to choose the triple when z = i, where i is an element from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n+1}.

When z = i, we need to choose two numbers, x and y, such that both x and y are less than i. Since duplicate numbers are allowed, we can choose x and y from the set {1, 2, 3, ..., i-1}.

The number of ways to choose x and y from this set is given by the product of the number of choices for each number. According to the rule of product, the number of choices for x is i-1 and the number of choices for y is also i-1.

Therefore, the number of ways to choose the triple when z = i is (i-1) * (i-1) = (i-1)^2.

Now, we need to consider all possible values of i from 1 to n+1. The total number of ways to choose the triple can be found by summing up the number of ways for each value of i.

Using the rule of sum, the total number of ways to choose the triple is:

[(1-1)^2] + [(2-1)^2] + [(3-1)^2] + ... + [(n+1-1)^2]
= 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2
= 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2

This is a well-known sum called the sum of squares, which has a closed-form expression. The sum of squares from 1 to n can be calculated using the formula:

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = (n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the triple, as an expression of n, is:

(n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1)) / 6

This is the final answer.</code></pre>
