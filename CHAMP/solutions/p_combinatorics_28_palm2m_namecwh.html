<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of either event A or event B occurring is 0.5 + 0.6 = 1.1.

The rule of sum can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of rolling a 6 on a die, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails, or the probability of getting a certain letter on a die.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of sum is only valid if the events are mutually exclusive. Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot occur at the same time. For example, the event of rolling a 6 on a die and the event of rolling a 1 on a die are mutually exclusive.

If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the rule of sum cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring. For example, the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is not equal to the sum of the probability of getting heads and the probability of getting tails. This is because the probability of flipping a coin and getting heads or tails is affected by the fact that the coin can land on its edge.

The rule of sum is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let f(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with 1 and g(n) be the number of length-n strings that end with either 2 or 3.
2. Find f(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).
3. Find g(n+1) in terms of f(n) and g(n).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $f(n)$ be the number of length-$n$ strings that end with 1 and $g(n)$ be the number of length-$n$ strings that end with either 2 or 3. We can find $f(n+1)$ in terms of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ as follows:

* There are $f(n)$ ways to end the string with 1, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits.
* There are $g(n)$ ways to end the string with either 2 or 3, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits.

Therefore, $f(n+1) = f(n) + 3g(n)$.

We can find $g(n+1)$ in terms of $f(n)$ and $g(n)$ as follows:

* There are $g(n)$ ways to end the string with either 2 or 3, followed by any of the $3$ possible digits.
* There are $f(n)$ ways to end the string with 1, followed by any of the $2$ possible digits that are not 1.

Therefore, $g(n+1) = g(n) + 2f(n)$.

We can use these recurrence relations to find $f(5)$ and $g(5)$. We start with the initial conditions $f(0) = 1$ and $g(0) = 2$. Then, we can use the recurrence relations to find $f(1) = 4$, $g(1) = 5$, $f(2) = 10$, $g(2) = 13$, $f(3) = 20$, $g(3) = 26$, $f(4) = 35$, and $g(4) = 41$. Finally, we can find $f(5) = 56$ and $g(5) = 62$.

Now, we need to find the number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors. We can do this by counting the number of strings that end with 1, the number of strings that end with 2, and the number of strings that end with 3. The number of strings that end with 1 is $f(5)$. The number of strings that end with 2 is $g(5)$. The number of strings that end with 3 is $f(5)$. Therefore, the total number of strings consisting of 5 digits of 1, 2 and 3 where no two 1s are neighbors is $f(5) + g(5) + f(5) = 56 + 62 + 56 = 174$.</code></pre>
