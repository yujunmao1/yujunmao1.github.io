<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. Let w_n be the maximum value of x_n, y_n, z_n. For different values of x_1, y_1, z_1, do we have w_200 always greater than 20, always smaller than 20, or sometimes greater and sometimes smaller than 20?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let a_n=x_n+y_n+z_n.
2. We have a_2^2=(x_1+1/x_1+y_1+1/y_1+z_1+1/z_1)^2/geq (2+2+2)^2=36=2*18.
3. If a_n^2≥18n, then we have a_(n+1)^2=(x_n+1/x_n+y_n+1/y_n+z_n+1/z_n)^2≥a_n^2+2(x_n+y_n+z_n)(1/x_n+1/y_n+1/z_n)≥a_n^2+2*9≥18n+18=18(n+1).
4. So we have a_n^2≥18n.
5. Thus, a_200^2≥18*200=3600, which means that a_200=x_200+y_200+z_200≥60.
6. So one of x_200, y_200, z_200 must be at least 20.
7. Thus, w_200 cannot be smaller than 20.

Problem: What are possible values of the limit of the sequence x_(n+1)=(x_n+a/x_n)/2, for different values of x_0&gt;0, a&gt;0, possibly as an expression of x_0, a?
Step-wise solution:
1. If a limit exist, it should solve the equation L=(L+a/L)/2, with solution L=±sqrt(a).
2. Since all numbers in the sequence is positive, we take L=sqrt(a).
3. Let e_n=x_n/L-1=x_n/sqrt(a)-1.
4. Thus, e_(n+1)=x_(n+1)/L-1=(x_n+a/x_n)/(2L)-1=(x_n+a/x_n)/(2sqrt(a))-1=(x_n/sqrt(a)+sqrt(a)/x_n)/2-1=(1+e_n+1/(1+e_n))/2-1=(((1+e_n)^2+1)/(1+e_n)-2)/2=e_n/(2(1+e_n)).
5. With this relationship, we see that e_(n+1)≈e_n/2 when e_n is large, and e_(n+1)≈e_n^2/2 when e_n is small.
6. In both cases, e_n approaches 0.
7. Thus, x_n approaches L=sqrt(a).
8. So the limit exists, and is equal to sqrt(a) for all values of x_0, a.

Problem: For x_1, x_2, ..., x_n≥0, with x_1+x_2+...+x_n=1, what is the minimum value of x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let a_1=a_2=...a_n=1 and b_i=x_i.
2. Thus, we have a_1*b_1+a_2*b_2+...+a_n*b_n≤sqrt(a_1^2+a_2^2+...+a_n^2)*sqrt(b_1^2+b_2^2+...+b_n^2).
3. Plugging in the values, we get 1≤sqrt(n)*sqrt(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2).
4. Thus, sqrt(x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2)≥1/sqrt(n), and x_1^2+x_2^2+...+x_n^2≥1/n.
5. So the smallest value is 1/n, which can be achieved at x_1=x_2=...=x_n=1/n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. At most how many of the three sequences can be bounded?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine how many of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} can be bounded, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequences based on their recursive definitions.

Given the recursive definitions:
x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n
y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n
z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n

We can see that each term of a sequence depends on the previous terms of the other two sequences. If any of the sequences were to be bounded, this would imply that the terms of that sequence do not grow without bound as n approaches infinity.

Let&#x27;s assume that one of the sequences, say {x_n}, is bounded. This means there exists some real number M such that x_n ≤ M for all n.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the recursive definition for y_(n+1). Since x_n is bounded by M, the term 1/x_n is bounded below by 1/M (since x_n &gt; 0). This means that y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n will always have a term that is at least 1/M, and since z_n is positive, y_(n+1) will be strictly greater than 1/M for all n.

Similarly, for z_(n+1), since y_n is strictly greater than 1/M, the term 1/y_n is bounded above by M. Therefore, z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n will always have a term that is at least 1/M, and since x_n is positive and bounded by M, z_(n+1) will be strictly greater than 1/M for all n.

This process shows that if one sequence is bounded, the other sequences will have terms that are strictly greater than a positive constant (1/M in this case). However, this does not necessarily mean that the other sequences are unbounded. To show that the other sequences are unbounded, we need to demonstrate that their terms can grow without bound.

Let&#x27;s assume that {y_n} is also bounded. Then there exists some real number N such that y_n ≤ N for all n. Since we have assumed that {x_n} is bounded by M, we have:

z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n ≤ M + 1/y_n ≤ M + 1/(1/M) = M + M = 2M

This would imply that {z_n} is also bounded, which contradicts the fact that if {x_n} and {y_n} are bounded, then {z_n} should have terms that are strictly greater than a positive constant and thus should be unbounded.

Therefore, we can conclude that at most one of the sequences can be bounded. If one sequence is bounded, the behavior of the other two sequences will depend on the initial conditions, but at least one of them must be unbounded to satisfy the recursive definitions. If two sequences were bounded, the third would also have to be bounded, which is not possible given the recursive relationships.

In conclusion, at most one of the three sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} can be bounded.</code></pre>
