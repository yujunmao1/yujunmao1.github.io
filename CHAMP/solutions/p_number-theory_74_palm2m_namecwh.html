<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and other fields. It can be used to solve problems that would be difficult or impossible to solve with traditional arithmetic.

Here are some of the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

* Addition and subtraction are the same in modular arithmetic as they are in regular arithmetic. For example, 13 + 4 = 17, which is equivalent to 5 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Multiplication is also the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic, except that when you multiply two numbers that are greater than the modulus, the result will be less than the modulus. For example, 13 * 4 = 52, which is equivalent to 0 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12.
* Division is not the same in modular arithmetic as it is in regular arithmetic. In modular arithmetic, you can only divide by numbers that are relatively prime to the modulus. For example, you can divide 13 by 4 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 4 and 12 are relatively prime. The result of the division is 3. However, you cannot divide 13 by 12 in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, because 12 and 12 are not relatively prime.
* The modulus is a special number that is used in modular arithmetic. It is the number that the other numbers are &quot;wrapped around&quot; to. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, 14 is equivalent to 2, and so on.

Modular arithmetic can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but it is a very powerful tool that can be used to solve many different kinds of problems.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Find all possible positive integer values of x such that x, x+10 and x+14 are all prime numbers.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider the three expressions modulo 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We are given that $x$, $x+10$, and $x+14$ are all prime numbers. We can consider the three expressions modulo 3. This means that we can replace each expression with its remainder when it is divided by 3. So, we have $x \equiv r_1 \pmod{3}$, $x+10 \equiv r_2 \pmod{3}$, and $x+14 \equiv r_3 \pmod{3}$.

We are also given that $x$, $x+10$, and $x+14$ are all positive integers. This means that $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ must all be positive integers.

We can now use the following theorem:

**Theorem:** If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all relatively prime to 3, then $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is also relatively prime to 3.

In other words, if $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, and $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all odd numbers, then $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$ is also an odd number.

We can use this theorem to show that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$ is also a positive integer. This is because $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ are all positive integers, and they are all odd numbers.

We can also use this theorem to show that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$ is not divisible by 3. This is because $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ are all positive integers, and they are all odd numbers.

Therefore, $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$ is a positive integer that is not divisible by 3. This means that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2$ must be equal to 1.

We can now solve for $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$. We have $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 = 1$. This means that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 + r_3^2 = 1$, and $r_1$, $r_2$, and $r_3$ are all positive integers.

We can now use the following theorem:

**Theorem:** If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then $a^2 + b^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8.

In other words, if $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then $a^2 + b^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 when it is divided by 8.

We can use this theorem to show that $r_1^2 + r_2^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 modulo 8. This is because $r_1$ and $r_2$ are both positive integers.

Therefore, $r_1^2 + r_2^2$ must be equal to 1 modulo 8.

We can now solve for $r_1$ and $r_2$. We have $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = 1$ modulo 8. This means that $r_1^2 + r_2^2 = 1$, and $r_1$ and $r_2$ are both positive integers.

We can now use the following theorem:

**Theorem:** If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then $a^2 + b^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 modulo 9.

In other words, if $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then $a^2 + b^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 when it is divided by 9.

We can use this theorem to show that $r_1^2 + r_2^2$ is either 0, 1, or 4 modulo 9. This is because $r_1$ and $r_2$ are both positive integers</code></pre>
