<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Vieta&#x27;s formulas are a set of three equations that relate the roots of a quadratic equation to the coefficients of the equation. The formulas are named after François Viète, a French mathematician who first discovered them in the 16th century.

The quadratic equation is ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0. The roots of the quadratic equation are the values of x that satisfy the equation.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas can be written as follows:

* Product of the roots: $r_1r_2 = -c/a$
* Sum of the roots: $r_1 + r_2 = -b/a$
* Square of the sum of the roots: $(r_1 + r_2)^2 = b^2 - 4ac$

Vieta&#x27;s formulas can be used to solve quadratic equations in a variety of ways. For example, if you know the product of the roots and the sum of the roots, you can use Vieta&#x27;s formulas to find the roots of the equation.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas can also be used to find the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The discriminant is a number that is used to determine whether the quadratic equation has two real roots, one real root, or no real roots.

The discriminant is given by the formula:

$D = b^2 - 4ac$

If $D &gt; 0$, then the quadratic equation has two real roots. If $D = 0$, then the quadratic equation has one real root. If $D &lt; 0$, then the quadratic equation has no real roots.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas can also be used to find the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function. The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function is the value of $y$ at the vertex of the parabola.

The vertex of the parabola is given by the formula:

$x = -b/(2a)$

The maximum or minimum value of the quadratic function is given by the formula:

$y = -D/4a$

where $D$ is the discriminant of the quadratic equation.

Vieta&#x27;s formulas are a powerful tool that can be used to solve quadratic equations and to find the maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when they reach a certain value, called the modulus. For example, in modular arithmetic with modulus 12, 13 is equivalent to 1, because 13 - 12 = 1.

Modular arithmetic is often used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. It can also be used to solve problems in everyday life, such as finding the day of the week on a given date.

The basic rules of modular arithmetic are as follows:

* Addition and subtraction are performed modulo the modulus. For example, 13 + 11 = 2, because 13 + 11 - 12 = 2.
* Multiplication is performed modulo the modulus. For example, 13 * 11 = 2, because 13 * 11 - 12 * 12 = 2.
* Division is performed modulo the modulus. For example, 13 / 11 = 1, because 13 - 12 * 1 = 1.
* Exponentiation is performed modulo the modulus. For example, 13^2 = 169, because 13^2 - 12^2 = 169.
* Modulo inverses are numbers that, when multiplied by the original number, give the modulus. For example, the modulo inverse of 13 modulo 12 is 11, because 13 * 11 = 143, which is congruent to 1 modulo 12.

Modular arithmetic can be used to solve a variety of problems. For example, you can use modular arithmetic to find the day of the week on a given date. To do this, you first need to find the remainder when the date is divided by 7. The remainder will be the day of the week. For example, if the date is 2023-02-24, then the remainder when divided by 7 is 2, so the day of the week is Tuesday.

Modular arithmetic can also be used to solve problems in computer science. For example, you can use modular arithmetic to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The greatest common divisor is the largest number that is a factor of both numbers. To find the greatest common divisor using modular arithmetic, you first need to find the remainders when the two numbers are divided by each other. The greatest common divisor is the smallest number that is a factor of both remainders. For example, if the two numbers are 12 and 18, then the remainders when divided by each other are 6 and 0. The greatest common divisor is 6, because 6 is a factor of both 6 and 0.

Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems. It is often used in computer science, cryptography, and number theory. It can also be used to solve problems in everyday life, such as finding the day of the week on a given date.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

If x_1, x_2 are the two roots of the polynomial x^2-6x+1, for how many integer n in {61, 62, ..., 120} does x_1^n+x_2^n divided by 5 give a remainder of 4?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let u=x+y, v=xy and s_n=x^n+y^n. Then, we have s_n=u*s_(n-1)-v*s_(n-2).
2. Study x^n+y^n mod 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>We are given that $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the two roots of the polynomial $x^2-6x+1$. We can factor this polynomial as $(x-x_1)(x-x_2) = x^2-6x+1$. This means that $x_1+x_2 = 6$ and $x_1x_2 = 1$.

We are also given that $n$ is an integer in the range $61$ to $120$. We want to know how many times $x_1^n+x_2^n$ leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.

We can use the following formula to compute $x_1^n+x_2^n$:

$$x_1^n+x_2^n = (x_1+x_2)s_n - v_n$$

where $s_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ powers of $x_1$ and $x_2$, and $v_n$ is the product of the first $n$ powers of $x_1$ and $x_2$.

We can compute $s_n$ and $v_n$ as follows:

$$s_n = x_1^n + x_2^n + x_1^{n-1}x_2 + x_1^{n-2}x_2^2 + \cdots + x_2^{n-1}x_1 + x_2^n$$

$$v_n = x_1^n x_2^n = x_1^{n-1}x_2^{n+1} + x_1^{n-2}x_2^{n+2} + \cdots + x_2^{n-1}x_1^2 + x_2^n$$

We can then substitute $x_1+x_2 = 6$ and $x_1x_2 = 1$ into the formula for $x_1^n+x_2^n$ to get:

$$x_1^n+x_2^n = (6)s_n - 1$$

We can then compute $s_n$ for each value of $n$ in the range $61$ to $120$. We find that $s_n$ is always divisible by 5 for $n$ in this range. This means that $x_1^n+x_2^n$ is always divisible by 5 for $n$ in this range.

Therefore, $x_1^n+x_2^n$ leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5 for exactly one value of $n$ in the range $61$ to 120. The answer is $\boxed{1}$.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The answer is 1, because $x_1^n+x_2^n$ is always divisible by 5 for $n$ in the range 61 to 120.</code></pre>
