Find the five-digit number abcde such that 4*abcde=edcba.

You may find the following information useful:

1. Let a be a positive integer and p be a prime. Then a^pâ‰¡a mod p.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem, we need to find a five-digit number \( abcde \) such that when multiplied by 4, it results in the number \( edcba \). This means that the digits are reversed when multiplied by 4.

Let&#x27;s denote the five-digit number \( abcde \) as \( 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e \).

When we multiply this number by 4, we get:

\[ 4(10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e) = 40000a + 4000b + 400c + 40d + 4e \]

This result should be equal to the number \( edcba \), which is:

\[ 10000e + 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Setting the two expressions equal to each other, we get:

\[ 40000a + 4000b + 400c + 40d + 4e = 10000e + 1000d + 100c + 10b + a \]

Now, let&#x27;s compare the coefficients of the powers of 10 on both sides of the equation:

For the units digit (10^0), we have:
\[ 4e = a \]

For the tens digit (10^1), we have:
\[ 40d = 10b \]
\[ 4d = b \]

For the hundreds digit (10^2), we have:
\[ 400c = 100c \]
\[ 4c = c \]

Since \( c \) must be a digit (0-9), the only solution for the equation \( 4c = c \) is \( c = 0 \).

For the thousands digit (10^3), we have:
\[ 4000b = 1000d \]
\[ 4b = d \]

For the ten-thousands digit (10^4), we have:
\[ 40000a = 10000e \]
\[ 4a = e \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( 4e = a \)
2. \( 4d = b \)
3. \( c = 0 \)
4. \( 4b = d \)
5. \( 4a = e \)

From equation 3, we know that \( c = 0 \).

From equation 1 and equation 5, we can see that \( a \) and \( e \) must be such that when \( a \) is multiplied by 4, it results in \( e \), and when \( e \) is divided by 4, it results in \( a \). This means that \( a \) must be a multiple of 4, and \( e \) must be divisible by 4. Since \( a \) and \( e \) are digits, the possible values for \( a \) are 1, 2, and \( e \) are 4, 8 respectively.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 1 \) and \( e = 4 \):
From equation 1: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \), which is not a single digit, so \( a = 1 \) and \( e = 4 \) is not a solution.

Let&#x27;s try \( a = 2 \) and \( e = 8 \):
From equation 1: \( 4 \times 8 = 32 \), which is not a single digit, so \( a = 2 \) and \( e = 8 \) is not a solution.

Since \( a \) cannot be 0 (as we are looking for a five-digit number), and we&#x27;ve exhausted the possible values for \( a \) and \( e \), we must have made a mistake in our assumptions. Let&#x27;s re-evaluate our approach.

We know that \( 4e \) must be a single digit, so \( e \) must be either 1 or 2 because if \( e \) were any larger, \( 4e \) would be a two-digit number. Let&#x27;s try these values:

If \( e = 1 \), then \( a = 4 \times 1 = 4 \).
If \( e = 2 \), then \( a = 4 \times 2 = 8 \).

Now, let&#x27;s use these values to find \( b \) and \( d \).

If \( a = 4 \) and \( e = 1 \), then:
From equation 5: \( e = 4a \), so \( 1 = 4 \times 4 \), which is not true. So this combination is not possible.

If \( a = 8 \) and \( e = 2 \), then:
From equation 5: \( e = 4a \), so \( 2 = 4 \times 8 \), which is not true. So this combination is not possible either.

It seems we&#x27;ve made a mistake in our logic. Let&#x27;s correct it.
