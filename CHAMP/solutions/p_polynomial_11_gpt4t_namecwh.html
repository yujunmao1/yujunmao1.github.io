<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: Vieta&#x27;s formula for quadratic equation.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Vieta&#x27;s formulas are a set of equations that relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a quadratic equation, which is a second-degree polynomial of the form

ax^2 + bx + c = 0,

where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0, Vieta&#x27;s formulas tell us that the sum and product of the roots of the equation can be directly found from the coefficients of the polynomial.

Let the roots of the quadratic equation be r1 and r2. Then Vieta&#x27;s formulas state that:

1. The sum of the roots is equal to the negation of the coefficient of the x term (b) divided by the coefficient of the x^2 term (a):
   r1 + r2 = -b/a

2. The product of the roots is equal to the constant term (c) divided by the coefficient of the x^2 term (a):
   r1 * r2 = c/a

These relationships are derived from the fact that any quadratic equation can be factored into the form:

a(x - r1)(x - r2) = 0

Expanding this product and comparing the coefficients with the original quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, we can see that:

a(x^2 - (r1 + r2)x + r1r2) = ax^2 - a(r1 + r2)x + ar1r2

Matching the coefficients, we get:

- a(r1 + r2) = b  =&gt;  r1 + r2 = -b/a
- ar1r2 = c       =&gt;  r1 * r2 = c/a

These formulas are very useful because they allow us to quickly find relationships between the roots without actually solving the equation. They also play a significant role in many areas of algebra, including polynomial factoring, solving systems of equations, and analyzing polynomial functions.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; after they reach a certain value—the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book &quot;Disquisitiones Arithmeticae,&quot; published in 1801.

Here are some basic rules and properties of modular arithmetic:

1. **Congruence**: Two integers a and b are said to be congruent modulo n if their difference a - b is an integer multiple of n. This is denoted as:
   a ≡ b (mod n)

2. **Addition**: If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a + c) ≡ (b + d) (mod n). In other words, the sum of two congruent numbers is also congruent to the sum of their respective equivalents.

3. **Subtraction**: If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a - c) ≡ (b - d) (mod n). Similar to addition, the difference between two congruent numbers is congruent to the difference of their respective equivalents.

4. **Multiplication**: If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then (a * c) ≡ (b * d) (mod n). The product of two congruent numbers is congruent to the product of their respective equivalents.

5. **Division**: Division is a bit more complex in modular arithmetic. If a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), you cannot necessarily conclude that a/c ≡ b/d (mod n) because division by a number is equivalent to multiplication by its multiplicative inverse, which may not exist in all modular systems. Division is only valid when the divisor has a multiplicative inverse modulo n.

6. **Exponentiation**: If a ≡ b (mod n), then a^k ≡ b^k (mod n) for any non-negative integer k. This means that congruence is preserved under exponentiation.

7. **Modular Inverses**: An integer a has a modular multiplicative inverse modulo n if there exists an integer x such that ax ≡ 1 (mod n). Not all integers have inverses modulo n; an integer a has an inverse modulo n if and only if a and n are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1).

8. **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: This theorem provides a way to solve systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli, under the condition that the moduli are pairwise coprime.

9. **Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem**: If p is a prime number, then for any integer a such that a is not divisible by p, it holds that a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). This theorem is useful for finding modular inverses and for working with large exponents in modular arithmetic.

10. **Euclidean Algorithm**: Although not a rule of modular arithmetic per se, the Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor of two integers, which is essential for determining whether an inverse exists and for simplifying modular expressions.

These rules form the basis of many computations in number theory, cryptography, computer science, and other fields that require working with integers in a cyclical fashion.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

If x_1, x_2 are the two roots of the polynomial x^2-6x+1, for how many integer n in {61, 62, ..., 120} does x_1^n+x_2^n divided by 5 give a remainder of 4?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let u=x+y, v=xy and s_n=x^n+y^n. Then, we have s_n=u*s_(n-1)-v*s_(n-2).
2. Study x^n+y^n mod 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Given the polynomial \( x^2 - 6x + 1 \), we can use Vieta&#x27;s formulas to find the sum and product of the roots \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \):

1. The sum of the roots \( u = x_1 + x_2 = 6 \).
2. The product of the roots \( v = x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1 \).

We are interested in the sequence \( s_n = x_1^n + x_2^n \) and want to find for how many integers \( n \) in the set {61, 62, ..., 120} the expression \( s_n \) divided by 5 gives a remainder of 4.

Using the given recursive formula \( s_n = u \cdot s_{n-1} - v \cdot s_{n-2} \), we can generate the sequence \( s_n \) modulo 5, since we are only interested in the remainder when \( s_n \) is divided by 5.

Let&#x27;s start by computing the first few terms of the sequence modulo 5:

\( s_0 = x_1^0 + x_2^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \) (mod 5)
\( s_1 = x_1^1 + x_2^1 = x_1 + x_2 = 6 \equiv 1 \) (mod 5)

Now we can use the recursive formula to find the next terms:

\( s_2 = u \cdot s_1 - v \cdot s_0 = 6 \cdot 1 - 1 \cdot 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 \) (mod 5)
\( s_3 = u \cdot s_2 - v \cdot s_1 = 6 \cdot 4 - 1 \cdot 1 = 24 - 1 = 23 \equiv 3 \) (mod 5)
\( s_4 = u \cdot s_3 - v \cdot s_2 = 6 \cdot 3 - 1 \cdot 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \equiv 4 \) (mod 5)
\( s_5 = u \cdot s_4 - v \cdot s_3 = 6 \cdot 4 - 1 \cdot 3 = 24 - 3 = 21 \equiv 1 \) (mod 5)

We notice that the sequence \( s_n \) modulo 5 is periodic with a period of 4, as the remainders repeat in the sequence 2, 1, 4, 3. This means that \( s_n \) will give a remainder of 4 when \( n \) is of the form 4k + 2, where k is a non-negative integer.

Now we need to find the values of \( n \) in the set {61, 62, ..., 120} that are of the form 4k + 2. The smallest such \( n \) in the set is 62 (since 62 = 4 * 15 + 2), and the largest is 118 (since 118 = 4 * 29 + 2).

We can find the number of such \( n \) by counting the number of integers k such that 62 ≤ 4k + 2 ≤ 118. Subtracting 2 from each part of the inequality, we get:

60 ≤ 4k ≤ 116

Dividing by 4, we get:

15 ≤ k ≤ 29

There are 29 - 15 + 1 = 15 values of k, and thus 15 values of \( n \) in the set {61, 62, ..., 120} for which \( s_n \) gives a remainder of 4 when divided by 5.</code></pre>
