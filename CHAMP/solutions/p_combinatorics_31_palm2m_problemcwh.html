<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. How many diagonals are there in a convex polygon of n vertices, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have C(n, 2) vertex pairs, and n of them are between adjacent vertices.
2. Thus, we have C(n, 2)-n=n(n-1)/2-n=n(n-3)/2 diagonals.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs is $8!$. This is because each dog can get any of the 3 cookies, and there are 8 dogs. However, this includes cases where some dogs get more than one cookie, and we want to exclude those cases.

To do this, we can first count the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs such that no dog gets more than one cookie. This can be done by using the stars and bars method. We have 8 dogs and 3 cookies, so we can use 8 stars and 3 bars to represent the cookies. We can then arrange the stars and bars in any order to represent the different ways to distribute the cookies. For example, the arrangement $\star\star\star||\bar|\bar$ represents the case where dog 1 gets 2 cookies, dog 2 gets 1 cookie, and dogs 3-8 get no cookies.

There are $\binom{8+3-1}{3-1}=\binom{10}{2}=45$ ways to arrange the stars and bars. However, this includes cases where some dogs get no cookies. To exclude these cases, we can subtract the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs such that at least one dog gets no cookies. This can be done by using the following formula:

$$\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}-\binom{n+k-2}{k-1}$$

where $n$ is the number of dogs and $k$ is the number of cookies. In this case, we have $n=8$ and $k=3$, so the formula gives us:

$$\binom{8+3-1}{3-1}-\binom{8+3-2}{3-1}=45-10=35$$

Therefore, the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs such that no dog gets more than one cookie is $45-10=35$.

To get the total number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs, we need to add this number to the number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs such that some dogs get more than one cookie. This can be done by using the following formula:

$$\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}$$

where $n$ is the number of dogs and $k$ is the number of cookies. In this case, we have $n=8$ and $k=3$, so the formula gives us:

$$\binom{8+3-1}{3-1}=56$$

Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute 3 cookies to 8 dogs is $56+35=91$.</code></pre>
