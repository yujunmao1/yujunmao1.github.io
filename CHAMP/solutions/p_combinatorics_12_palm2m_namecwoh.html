<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product is a mathematical rule that states that the probability of two events occurring together is equal to the product of the probabilities of each event occurring separately. For example, if the probability of event A occurring is 0.5 and the probability of event B occurring is 0.6, then the probability of both events occurring together is 0.5 * 0.6 = 0.3.

The rule of product can be used to calculate the probability of a variety of events, such as the probability of two people being born on the same day, the probability of two cards being drawn from a deck of cards with the same face value, or the probability of two events occurring in a row.

The rule of product is a powerful tool that can be used to make predictions about the likelihood of events occurring. It is important to note, however, that the rule of product is only valid if the events are independent. Independent events are events that do not affect each other. For example, the probability of drawing a red card from a deck of cards is not affected by the probability of drawing a black card.

If the events are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be used to calculate the probability of the events occurring together. For example, the probability of two people being born on the same day is not equal to the product of the probability of each person being born on that day. This is because the probability of two people being born on the same day is affected by the fact that they are related.

The rule of product is a valuable tool for calculating the probability of events. However, it is important to use the rule correctly and to be aware of its limitations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of sequences of parking choices is the number of ways to choose $n$ parking spots from $n$ available spots, which is $\binom{n}{n} = 1$.

To see this, consider the following example with $n=3$ parking spots. The first driver can choose any of the three spots, so there are $3$ possible choices. The second driver can then choose any of the remaining two spots, so there are $2$ possible choices. The third driver can then choose any of the remaining one spot, so there is $1$ possible choice. This gives a total of $3\cdot2\cdot1 = 6$ possible sequences of parking choices.

However, some of these sequences are not valid, because they do not result in every driver being able to park. For example, the sequence $(1,2,3)$ is not valid, because the third driver will not be able to find a free spot.

The only valid sequences are those in which the drivers park in increasing order of their favorite parking spots. For example, the sequence $(3,2,1)$ is valid, because the first driver parks in their favorite spot (3), the second driver parks in their second favorite spot (2), and the third driver parks in their favorite spot (1).

There are $\binom{n}{n}$ ways to choose $n$ parking spots from $n$ available spots, and each of these choices results in a valid sequence of parking choices. Therefore, the number of sequences of parking choices is $\binom{n}{n} = 1$.</code></pre>
