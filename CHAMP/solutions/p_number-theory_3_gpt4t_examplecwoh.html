If a | bc and gcd(b, c)=1, then we can find integer m, n, p, q such that b=mp, c=nq, gcd(m, n)=gcd(p, q)=1 and pq=a.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s apply the given concept with an example. We are given that \( a \) divides \( bc \) and that the greatest common divisor of \( b \) and \( c \) is 1, i.e., \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). We want to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of integers \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \).

Let&#x27;s choose specific values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \) to illustrate this. Suppose we take \( a = 10 \), \( b = 15 \), and \( c = 4 \). We can check that \( a \) divides \( bc \) since \( 10 \) divides \( 60 \) (since \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \)), and \( \gcd(15, 4) = 1 \) because 15 and 4 have no common divisors other than 1.

Now, we need to find \( m, n, p, q \) such that \( b = mp \), \( c = nq \), \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(p, q) = 1 \), and \( pq = a \). Since \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) and \( q \) to be the prime factors of \( a \), which are 2 and 5. So, let&#x27;s set \( p = 2 \) and \( q = 5 \), which gives us \( pq = 2 \times 5 = 10 = a \).

Now, we need to find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can set \( m = 15 / 2 \). However, \( m \) must be an integer, so we cannot directly divide 15 by 2. Instead, we can find a multiple of \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). Since \( b = 15 \) and \( p = 2 \), we can multiply \( b \) by \( q = 5 \) to get a new value for \( b \) that is divisible by \( p \). So, \( b \) becomes \( 15 \times 5 = 75 \), and now \( m = 75 / 2 = 37.5 \), which is still not an integer.

We seem to have hit a snag. The issue here is that we cannot simply multiply \( b \) by \( q \) to make it divisible by \( p \) because that changes the value of \( b \), which is not allowed. We must find \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( b = mp \) and \( c = nq \) without altering the original values of \( b \) and \( c \).

Let&#x27;s try a different approach. Since \( b = 15 \) and \( c = 4 \), and we want \( \gcd(m, n) = 1 \), we can choose \( m \) and \( n \) to be \( b \) and \( c \) themselves, respectively, because \( \gcd(b, c) = 1 \). So, we set \( m = b = 15 \) and \( n = c = 4 \).

Now, we have \( b = mp = 15 \times 2 = 30 \) and \( c = nq = 4 \times 5 = 20 \), but this is incorrect because we have altered the original values of \( b \) and \( c \). We need to find \( p \) and \( q \) such that when multiplied by \( m \) and \( n \), respectively, they give us the original \( b \) and \( c \).

Since \( b = 15 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( p \) to be a factor of \( a \) that also divides \( b \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that also divides \( b \) is 5. So, we set \( p = 5 \), and thus \( m = b / p = 15 / 5 = 3 \).

Since \( c = 4 \) and \( a = 10 \), we can choose \( q \) to be a factor of \( a \) that is coprime with \( m = 3 \). The factors of \( a \) are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The factor that is coprime with 3 is 2. So, we set \( q = 2 \), and thus \( n = c / q = 4 / 2 = 2 \).

Now we have:
- \( m = 3 \), \( p = 5 \), so \( b = mp = 3 \times 5 = 15 \) (which is the original value of \( b \)).
- \( n = 2 \), \( q = 2 \), so \( c = nq = 2 \times 2 = 4 \) (which is the original value of \( c \)).
- \( pq = 5 \times 2 = 10 = a \).
- \( \gcd(m, n) = \gcd(3, 2) = 1 \) and \( \gcd(p, q) = \gcd(5, 2) = 1 \).

Thus, we have found integers \( m, n, p, q \) that satisfy all the conditions given in the concept.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

An integer a is called automorphic if a^2 ends in a. For example, 5 is automorphic because 5^2=25 ends in 5. 25 is also automorphic because 25^2=625 ends in 25. Find all three-digit automorphic numbers.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find all three-digit automorphic numbers, we need to find integers \( a \) such that the last three digits of \( a^2 \) are \( a \) itself. Let&#x27;s denote \( a \) as a three-digit number \( abc \) (where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are digits and \( a \neq 0 \)).

The square of \( a \), which is \( a^2 \), must end in the digits \( abc \). This means that \( a^2 \) modulo 1000 must be equal to \( a \). In other words, \( a^2 \equiv a \mod 1000 \).

Let&#x27;s start by squaring the last digit \( c \) and see how it behaves. The last digit of \( a^2 \) must be \( c \), so \( c^2 \) must end in \( c \). The possible last digits that satisfy this condition are 0, 1, 5, and 6 because:

- \( 0^2 = 0 \)
- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 6^2 = 36 \)

Now, let&#x27;s check each of these possibilities for the last digit \( c \) and see if we can find a corresponding three-digit number \( a \) that is automorphic.

1. If \( c = 0 \), then \( a \) must be a multiple of 10. However, since \( a \) is a three-digit number, the square of a multiple of 10 will end in 00, not just 0. So, there are no three-digit automorphic numbers ending in 0.

2. If \( c = 1 \), then \( a \) must end in 1. Let&#x27;s try squaring numbers ending in 1 and see if any three-digit numbers satisfy the condition. We quickly find that \( 376^2 = 141376 \), which ends in 376. So, 376 is an automorphic number.

3. If \( c = 5 \), then \( a \) must end in 5. Since the last digit of \( a^2 \) is determined by the last digit of \( a \), we only need to consider the last two digits of \( a^2 \). Squaring numbers ending in 25, we find that \( 625^2 = 390625 \), which ends in 625. So, 625 is an automorphic number.

4. If \( c = 6 \), then \( a \) must end in 6. Squaring numbers ending in 6, we find that \( 376^2 = 141376 \), which ends in 376. We&#x27;ve already found this number when checking for \( c = 1 \), so it confirms that 376 is an automorphic number.

Now we have found two three-digit automorphic numbers: 376 and 625. There are no other three-digit numbers ending in 1, 5, or 6 that are automorphic because the pattern of the last three digits would not match the original number.

Therefore, the three-digit automorphic numbers are 376 and 625.</code></pre>
