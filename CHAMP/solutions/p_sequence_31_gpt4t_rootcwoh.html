<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What are possible values of the limit of the sequence a_n=sqrt(a_(n-1))+sqrt(a_(n-2)), for different initial values of 0&lt;a_0, a_1&lt;1, possibly as an expression of a_0, a_1?

You may find the following information useful:

1. For non-negative x, y, sqrt(x)≥sqrt(y) if and only if x≥y.
2. A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the possible values of the limit of the sequence \( a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \), we need to consider the behavior of the sequence as \( n \) goes to infinity. Let&#x27;s denote the limit of the sequence as \( L \), assuming it exists.

Given that \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \), we can see that the sequence is bounded below by 0 because square roots of non-negative numbers are non-negative. We also know that the sequence is bounded above by 2 since \( \sqrt{a_{n-1}} &lt; 1 \) and \( \sqrt{a_{n-2}} &lt; 1 \) for all \( n \), and their sum is therefore less than 2.

If the sequence has a limit \( L \), then as \( n \) goes to infinity, the terms \( a_{n-1} \) and \( a_{n-2} \) will both approach \( L \). Therefore, we can write the limit equation as:

\[ L = \sqrt{L} + \sqrt{L} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ L = 2\sqrt{L} \]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root gives us:

\[ L^2 = 4L \]

Dividing both sides by \( L \) (assuming \( L \neq 0 \), which is reasonable since \( a_0, a_1 &gt; 0 \)) gives us:

\[ L = 4 \]

However, this is not possible since we established that the sequence is bounded above by 2. Therefore, we must have made an incorrect assumption. The mistake was in dividing by \( L \) without considering the case \( L = 0 \). Let&#x27;s revisit the equation:

\[ L^2 = 4L \]

This equation has two solutions: \( L = 0 \) and \( L = 4 \). Since \( L = 4 \) is not possible, we are left with \( L = 0 \) as the only possible limit.

However, we need to verify that the sequence is indeed monotonically decreasing to ensure that \( L = 0 \) is the limit. To do this, we need to show that \( a_n \leq a_{n-1} \) for all \( n \).

Let&#x27;s assume that \( a_{n-1} \leq a_{n-2} \). Then, by the property of square roots:

\[ \sqrt{a_{n-1}} \leq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \]

Adding \( \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \) to both sides gives us:

\[ \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \leq 2\sqrt{a_{n-2}} \]

Since \( \sqrt{a_{n-2}} &lt; 1 \), we have:

\[ 2\sqrt{a_{n-2}} &lt; 2 \]

Therefore:

\[ a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} &lt; 2 \]

This shows that \( a_n \) is bounded above by 2. To show that the sequence is monotonically decreasing, we need to show that \( a_n \leq a_{n-1} \) for all \( n \). If \( a_{n-1} \leq a_{n-2} \), then:

\[ a_n = \sqrt{a_{n-1}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \leq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} + \sqrt{a_{n-2}} = 2\sqrt{a_{n-2}} \]

Since \( a_{n-1} \leq a_{n-2} \), we have \( \sqrt{a_{n-1}} \leq \sqrt{a_{n-2}} \), and thus:

\[ 2\sqrt{a_{n-2}} \leq 2\sqrt{a_{n-1}} \]

This implies:

\[ a_n \leq 2\sqrt{a_{n-1}} \]

But we need to show that \( a_n \leq a_{n-1} \), not \( 2\sqrt{a_{n-1}} \). We need to be careful here because the above argument does not necessarily imply that the sequence is monotonically decreasing. We need to establish a stronger condition to ensure that \( a_n \leq a_{n-1} \).

Let&#x27;s consider the initial conditions. Since \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \), we have:

\[ a_2 = \sqrt{a_1} + \sqrt{a_0} \]

If \( a_1 \leq a_0 \), then \( a_2 \leq 2\sqrt{a_0} \), and since \( \sqrt{a_0} &lt; 1 \), we have \( a_2 &lt; 2 \). However, we cannot immediately conclude that \( a_2 \leq a_1 \) without additional information about the relationship between \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \).

To proceed, we need to analyze the behavior of the sequence further. If the sequence is not monotonically decreasing, it could still converge if it is eventually decreasing and bounded. We need to consider the dynamics of the sequence and whether it can stabilize to a point where \( a_n \) becomes less than or equal to \( a_{n-1} \).

Let&#x27;s assume that the sequence does stabilize and becomes monotonically decreasing at some point. Then, the limit \( L \) must satisfy the equation \( L = 2\sqrt{L} \), which gives us \( L = 0 \) as the only feasible solution.

In conclusion, the possible value of the limit of the sequence, assuming it exists and the sequence stabilizes to a monotonically decreasing behavior, is \( L = 0 \). However, without a rigorous proof that the sequence is monotonically decreasing from some point onwards, we cannot definitively say that the limit is \( L = 0 \) for all initial conditions \( 0 &lt; a_0, a_1 &lt; 1 \). The behavior of the sequence may depend on the specific values of \( a_0 \) and \( a_1 \), and a more detailed analysis would be required to determine the limit for every possible pair of initial conditions.</code></pre>
