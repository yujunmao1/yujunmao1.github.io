<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 5 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors (i.e., the string does not contain &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot; as substrings).

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 24 possible strings of length 5 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of these, 6 contain the substring &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;. Therefore, there are 24 - 6 = 18 strings of length 5 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors.

To see why there are 6 strings that contain the substring &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;, we can consider the following cases:

* The string starts with &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;. There are 2 ways to do this.
* The string ends with &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;. There are 2 ways to do this.
* The string contains &quot;12&quot; in the middle. There are 3 ways to do this.

In total, there are 2 + 2 + 3 = 6 strings that contain the substring &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;.

To see why there are 18 strings that do not contain the substring &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;, we can consider the following cases:

* The string starts with 1 or 2. There are 2 ways to do this.
* The string ends with 1 or 2. There are 2 ways to do this.
* The string contains 1 or 2 in the middle, but not both. There are 6 ways to do this.

In total, there are 2 + 2 + 6 = 10 ways to choose the first and last digit of the string, and 6 ways to choose the middle digit of the string. However, we need to divide by 2 because we are counting each string twice, once for the forward order and once for the backward order. So, there are 10 / 2 = 5 ways to choose the digits of the string.

We also need to consider the order of the digits. There are 5! ways to order 5 digits, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 digits 3 times. So, there are 5! / 3! = 20 ways to order the digits of the string.

In total, there are 5 * 20 = 100 strings of length 5 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4. Of these, 6 contain the substring &quot;12&quot; or &quot;21&quot;, so there are 100 - 6 = 94 strings of length 5 consisting solely of the digits 1, 2, 3, and 4 that have the property that any 1 and 2 are never neighbors.</code></pre>
