<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is known as a &quot;combination,&quot; which is a way of selecting items from a larger set such that the order of selection does not matter. The notation C(n, k) is often read as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is mathematically defined as:

\[ C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate this concept:

Suppose you have a group of 5 friends, and you want to invite 3 of them to a dinner party. You&#x27;re interested in how many different groups of 3 friends you can invite without considering the order in which you invite them.

Using the combination formula, you can calculate the number of ways to choose 3 friends out of 5 as follows:

\[ C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(3 \times 2 \times 1)(2 \times 1)} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 different ways to choose 3 friends from a group of 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is an application of the fundamental counting principle, which states that if you have a series of decisions or steps to make, and each step has a certain number of independent choices, then the total number of ways to complete the entire series is the product of the number of choices at each step.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Imagine you&#x27;re getting dressed and you have to decide on your outfit, which consists of a shirt, pants, and a pair of shoes. You have the following options:

- Shirts: You have 4 different shirts to choose from.
- Pants: You have 3 different pairs of pants to choose from.
- Shoes: You have 2 different pairs of shoes to choose from.

To find the total number of different outfits you can put together, you multiply the number of choices for each item of clothing:

\[ p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \]

So, you have:

\[ 4 \text{ (shirts)} \times 3 \text{ (pants)} \times 2 \text{ (shoes)} = 24 \text{ different outfits} \]

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to choose an outfit from your wardrobe options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is another application of the fundamental counting principle, specifically when you have mutually exclusive choices for performing an action. This means that you can perform only one action at a time, and the total number of ways to perform the action is the sum of the individual ways to perform each action.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Suppose you have a free evening and you&#x27;re trying to decide what to do. You have three options, but you can only choose one because they all take up the entire evening:

1. Go to the movies: There are 5 different movies playing at your local theater that you&#x27;re interested in seeing.
2. Read a book: You have 3 different books on your shelf that you&#x27;ve been meaning to read.
3. Play a video game: You have 2 new video games that you haven&#x27;t started yet.

Since you can only choose one activity for the evening, the total number of ways you can spend your evening is the sum of the ways to perform each individual activity:

\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 5 + 3 + 2 \]

So, you have:

\[ 5 \text{ (movies)} + 3 \text{ (books)} + 2 \text{ (video games)} = 10 \text{ different ways to spend your evening} \]

Therefore, there are 10 different ways you can choose to spend your evening based on these mutually exclusive activities.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, r)=n!/(r!*(n-r)!)=n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*(n-r+1)/r!.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The formula you&#x27;ve provided is another way to express the combination formula, which calculates the number of ways to choose a subset of r items from a larger set of n items without regard to the order of selection. This formula is particularly useful when n is large and r is small because it avoids the need to calculate the factorials of large numbers.

Here&#x27;s an example using this formula:

Imagine you&#x27;re organizing a committee and you need to select 3 members from a group of 10 people. You want to know how many different committees of 3 can be formed.

Using the given formula, you can calculate the number of ways to choose 3 people out of 10 as follows:

\[ C(10, 3) = \frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{3 \times 2 \times 1} \]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[ C(10, 3) = \frac{10 \times 9 \times 8}{6} = 10 \times 3 \times 4 = 120 \]

So, there are 120 different ways to choose a committee of 3 members from a group of 10 people.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to consider the different scenarios in which at least two boys are selected to receive toys. There are three scenarios to consider:

1. All three toys are given to boys.
2. Two toys are given to boys and one toy is given to a girl.
3. One toy is given to a boy and two toys are given to girls (this scenario does not satisfy the condition of at least two boys being selected, so we will not consider it).

Let&#x27;s calculate the number of ways for each scenario:

1. All three toys are given to boys:
Since there are four boys, we want to choose 3 boys from the 4 available to give the toys to. This can be done in \( C(4, 3) \) ways.

\[ C(4, 3) = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4}{1} = 4 \]

So, there are 4 ways to give all three toys to the boys.

2. Two toys are given to boys and one toy is given to a girl:
First, we choose 2 boys from the 4 available to give two of the toys to. This can be done in \( C(4, 2) \) ways. Then, we choose 1 girl from the 6 available to give the remaining toy to. This can be done in \( C(6, 1) \) ways.

\[ C(4, 2) = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6 \]
\[ C(6, 1) = \frac{6!}{1!(6-1)!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \]

Now, we multiply the number of ways to choose the boys by the number of ways to choose the girl:

\[ 6 \text{ (ways to choose 2 boys)} \times 6 \text{ (ways to choose 1 girl)} = 36 \]

So, there are 36 ways to give two toys to boys and one toy to a girl.

Adding the number of ways for each scenario, we get the total number of ways to distribute the toys such that at least two boys are selected:

\[ 4 \text{ (all boys)} + 36 \text{ (two boys, one girl)} = 40 \]

Therefore, there are 40 different ways to distribute the three toys among the children while ensuring that at least two boys are selected.</code></pre>
