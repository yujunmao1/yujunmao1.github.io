<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

Problem: A diagnoal in a convex polygon is any line connecting two non-adjacent vertices. How many diagonals are there in a convex polygon of n vertices, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have C(n, 2) vertex pairs, and n of them are between adjacent vertices.
2. Thus, we have C(n, 2)-n=n(n-1)/2-n=n(n-3)/2 diagonals.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of 8 dogs fighting over 3 identical cookies, we can use a combinatorial method known as &quot;stars and bars&quot; or &quot;balls and bins.&quot; The idea is to distribute the cookies to the dogs in such a way that each dog can get 0, 1, 2, or all 3 cookies, but no two dogs can share a cookie.

We can think of this as placing 3 indistinguishable cookies (stars) into 8 distinguishable bins (dogs). The bins are separated by 7 dividers (bars), which represent the dogs. The placement of the cookies into the bins can be visualized as a sequence of cookies (stars) and dogs (bars).

For example, a possible distribution could be represented as follows:
- Dog 1: * | Dog 2: * | Dog 3: * | Dog 4: | Dog 5: | Dog 6: | Dog 7: | Dog 8:

This corresponds to the first three dogs each getting one cookie.

To find the total number of distributions, we need to count the number of ways to arrange the 3 cookies and 7 dividers in a row. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 10 objects (3 white dots for cookies and 7 black dots for dividers) in a row.

The number of ways to arrange these 10 objects is given by the number of permutations of 10 objects taken 3 at a time, which is the same as choosing 3 positions for the cookies out of 10 possible positions. This can be calculated using the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

In our case, n = 10 (total positions) and k = 3 (positions for cookies), so we have:

C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!)
C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * 7!)
C(10, 3) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1)
C(10, 3) = 120

Therefore, there are 120 possible results for the distribution of 3 identical cookies among 8 different dogs.</code></pre>
