<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: For a≤b, define the sequence as a_1=a, a_2=b, a_(n+2)=(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2. Does the limit exist for this sequence, and if so, find it as an expression in terms of a and b.
Step-wise solution:
1. We have |a_(n+2)-a_(n+1)|=|(a_(n+1)+a_n)/2-a_(n+1)|=|a_(n+1)-a_n|/2, so the difference between evry two terms is halved.
2. Thus, the limit exists, and its limit is the same as the limit of every (infinite) subsequence of it.
3. We see that a_2&gt;a_1, a_1&lt;a_3&lt;a_2, a_2&gt;a_4&gt;a_3, a_3&lt;a_5&lt;a_4, ....
4. So we have a_1&lt;a_3&lt;a_5&lt;... and study the limit of this subsequence.
5. We have a_3-a_1=(a_2-a_1)/2=(b-a)/2.
6. a_5-a_3=(a_4-a_3)/2=(a_2-a_3)/4=(a_2-a_1)/8=(b-a)/8.
7. a_7-a_5=(a_6-a_5)/2=(a_4-a_5)/4=(a_4-a_3)/8=(a_2-a_3)/16=(a_2-a_1)/32=(b-a)/32.
8. So the limit is a+(b-a)*(1/2+1/8+1/32+...)=a+(b-a)*2/3=(a+2b)/3.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let P(x)=x^(2n)-2x^(2n-1)+3x^(2n-2)-4x^(2n-3)+...-2nx+2n+1. For how many values of n∈{1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) has at least one real-valued root?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study the positivity of P(x) when x≤0.
2. For x&gt;0, study the positivity of x*P(x)+P(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the polynomial P(x) and its behavior for different values of x, particularly when x ≤ 0 and x &gt; 0.

First, let&#x27;s consider the case when x ≤ 0. We can see that each term in the polynomial P(x) is of the form (-1)^(k+1) * k * x^(2n-k), where k ranges from 1 to 2n. Since x ≤ 0, the term (-1)^(k+1) * x^(2n-k) will be non-negative for all k because the exponent 2n-k is even, and the factor (-1)^(k+1) will alternate signs starting with negative for k=1. Therefore, the terms of the polynomial will alternate between non-positive and non-negative, starting with a non-positive term for k=1. However, the constant term 2n+1 is always positive. Since the polynomial starts with a non-positive term and ends with a positive term, and the terms alternate in sign, it is possible for the polynomial to have a real root when x ≤ 0. However, we need to be more precise.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the case when x &gt; 0. We want to study the positivity of x*P(x) + P(x). This is equivalent to studying P(x) + P(x)/x. Let&#x27;s expand this expression:

P(x) + P(x)/x = (x^(2n) - 2x^(2n-1) + 3x^(2n-2) - ... - 2nx + 2n+1) + (x^(2n-1) - 2x^(2n-2) + 3x^(2n-3) - ... - 2n + (2n+1)/x)

Notice that when we add P(x) to P(x)/x, the terms combine in such a way that the coefficients of the x^(2n-k) terms for k=1 to 2n are all positive. This is because we are effectively adding k to (-k), resulting in 0, and then adding the next term which is (k+1), resulting in a positive coefficient. The constant term (2n+1)/x is also positive since x &gt; 0. Therefore, for x &gt; 0, the expression x*P(x) + P(x) is strictly positive.

Given that P(x) + P(x)/x is strictly positive for x &gt; 0, P(x) cannot have any positive roots. Therefore, any real roots of P(x) must be non-positive.

Now, we need to determine for how many values of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100} does P(x) have at least one real-valued root. Since we have established that P(x) can only have non-positive roots, we need to check if P(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x moves from positive to negative values.

For x = 0, P(0) = 2n+1, which is always positive. As x becomes negative, the leading term x^(2n) will dominate the behavior of the polynomial, and since the leading coefficient is 1, P(x) will be positive for large negative x. However, since the terms alternate in sign, there is a possibility that P(x) crosses the x-axis as x decreases from 0 to negative values.

Since P(x) is a polynomial of degree 2n, it will have at most 2n real roots. However, we are only interested in whether it has at least one real root. The polynomial will have at least one real root if there is a sign change from positive to negative as x moves from positive to negative values.

To determine this, we need to consider the behavior of the polynomial for small negative values of x. If the polynomial has a local maximum at a negative value of x and then decreases to the constant term 2n+1, it will have crossed the x-axis, indicating at least one real root.

Without loss of generality, we can consider the derivative of P(x) to find the critical points. However, this approach may be too complex to analyze for each n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}.

Instead, we can use the fact that for x &lt; 0, the polynomial starts with a non-positive term and ends with a positive term, and the terms alternate in sign. This suggests that P(x) will indeed cross the x-axis for some negative value of x, implying that P(x) will have at least one real root for each n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}.

Therefore, the answer is that P(x) has at least one real-valued root for all 100 values of n ∈ {1, 2, ..., 100}.</code></pre>
