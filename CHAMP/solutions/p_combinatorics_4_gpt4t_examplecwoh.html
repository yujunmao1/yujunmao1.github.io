<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider a simple example of making a sandwich, where each step has a certain number of choices.

Step 1: Choose the type of bread.
- White bread
- Wheat bread
- Rye bread

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to choose the bread.

Step 2: Choose the type of protein.
- Turkey
- Ham
- Chicken
- Tofu

There are p_2 = 4 ways to choose the protein.

Step 3: Choose the type of cheese.
- Cheddar
- Swiss
- Provolone

There are p_3 = 3 ways to choose the cheese.

Step 4: Choose to add vegetables or not.
- Lettuce and tomato
- No vegetables

There are p_4 = 2 ways to choose the vegetables.

Now, according to the concept, to find the total number of different sandwiches that can be made, we multiply the number of ways to complete each step:

Total number of different sandwiches = p_1 * p_2 * p_3 * p_4
                                     = 3 * 4 * 3 * 2
                                     = 72

So, there are 72 different ways to make a sandwich given these options at each step.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s consider an example where you have free time during the weekend and you want to choose an activity to do on Saturday. You have several options, but you can only do one activity due to time constraints.

Action 1: Watch a movie.
- You have 3 movies you&#x27;re interested in watching.

So, there are p_1 = 3 ways to perform the first action.

Action 2: Read a book.
- You have 2 new books to choose from.

There are p_2 = 2 ways to perform the second action.

Action 3: Go for a hike.
- There are 4 different trails nearby.

There are p_3 = 4 ways to perform the third action.

Action 4: Visit a friend.
- You have 5 friends you could potentially visit.

There are p_4 = 5 ways to perform the fourth action.

Since you can only choose one activity to do on Saturday, the total number of ways you can spend your time is the sum of the ways to perform each individual action:

Total number of ways to spend Saturday = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4
                                        = 3 + 2 + 4 + 5
                                        = 14

So, there are 14 different ways you could choose to spend your Saturday, given these activity options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A one-to-one mapping p: {1, 2, ..., n}-&gt;{1, 2, ..., n} is called an involution, if p∘p=identity (i.e., p(p(i))=i for all i∈{1, ..., n}). Find the number of involutions on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To find the number of involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we need to consider the different ways elements can be paired such that applying the mapping twice returns each element to itself.

An involution on a set can be thought of as a permutation where each element is either fixed (maps to itself) or swapped with exactly one other element. For the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, we can have:

- 0 swaps (all elements are fixed),
- 1 swap (two elements are swapped and the rest are fixed),
- 2 swaps (four elements are involved in swaps and the rest are fixed),
- 3 swaps (all six elements are involved in swaps).

Let&#x27;s calculate the number of involutions for each case:

0 swaps: There is exactly 1 way to do this, where every element maps to itself.

1 swap: We have 6 elements, and we want to choose 2 of them to swap. This can be done in C(6,2) ways (where C(n,k) is the binomial coefficient &quot;n choose k&quot;). After choosing the 2 elements to swap, there is only 1 way to swap them. So, there are C(6,2) * 1 = 15 ways for 1 swap.

2 swaps: We have 6 elements, and we want to choose 4 of them to be involved in swaps. This can be done in C(6,4) ways. After choosing these 4 elements, there are 2 ways to pair them up for swapping. However, we must divide by 2 to correct for overcounting, as the order of the swaps does not matter (AB-CD is the same as CD-AB). So, there are C(6,4) * (2/2) = 15 ways for 2 swaps.

3 swaps: We have 6 elements, and all of them will be involved in swaps. There are C(6,2) ways to choose the first pair to swap, then C(4,2) ways to choose the second pair from the remaining 4 elements, and finally C(2,2) ways to choose the last pair from the remaining 2 elements. This gives us C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2) ways. However, we must divide by 3! (3 factorial) to correct for overcounting, as the order of the swaps does not matter (ABC-DEF is the same as BCA-EFD, etc.). So, there are (C(6,2) * C(4,2) * C(2,2)) / 3! = (15 * 6 * 1) / 6 = 15 ways for 3 swaps.

Adding up the number of involutions for each case, we get:

Total number of involutions = 1 (0 swaps) + 15 (1 swap) + 15 (2 swaps) + 15 (3 swaps)
                            = 1 + 15 + 15 + 15
                            = 46

Therefore, there are 46 different involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.</code></pre>
