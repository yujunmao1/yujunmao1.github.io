<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The difference of squares formula is a special case of a formula in algebra where the expression a^2 - b^2 can be factored into (a - b)(a + b). 

This formula is called the difference of squares because it involves the subtraction (difference) of two perfect square numbers. 

Here&#x27;s how it works:

Let&#x27;s say you have the expression x^2 - 9. This is a difference of squares, because x^2 is a square and 9 is a square (3^2 = 9). 

According to the difference of squares formula, you can factor this expression into (x - 3)(x + 3). 

This formula is very useful in algebra for simplifying expressions and solving equations.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: modular arithmetic rules.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers &quot;wrap around&quot; when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. It&#x27;s often used in computer science, cryptography, and in solving many mathematical problems. 

Here are the basic rules of modular arithmetic:

1. **Addition:** If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m). This means that if two numbers a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and two other numbers c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the sum of a and c will have the same remainder as the sum of b and d when divided by m.

2. **Subtraction:** If a ≡ b (mod m), then a - c ≡ b - c (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, then the difference between a and any number c will have the same remainder as the difference between b and c when divided by m.

3. **Multiplication:** If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then ac ≡ bd (mod m). This means that if a and b have the same remainder when divided by m, and c and d also have the same remainder when divided by m, then the product of a and c will have the same remainder as the product of b and d when divided by m.

4. **Division:** Division is more complicated in modular arithmetic and doesn&#x27;t always work in the same way as the other operations. In general, you can&#x27;t just divide both sides of a congruence by a number, unless you know that number is relatively prime to the modulus (i.e., the greatest common divisor of the number and the modulus is 1).

These rules make modular arithmetic a very powerful tool in number theory and other areas of mathematics.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

What is the smallest value of |12^m-5^n| for positive integers m and n?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Study if the expression can be 0.
2. Study if the expression could equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 by observing that 5 and 12 are co-prime to each other.
3. If gcd(a,b)=1 and a≠1, then gcd(a, b^n)=1 (i.e., a ∤ b^n) for any n.
4. Determine if 12^m-5^n can be 1 by expressing 5^n in terms of m and studying its factors.
5. To determine if 5^n-12^m can be 1, consider the equation modulo 3 and establish the parity condition of n.
6. For even n, factor 5^n-1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.
7. Recognize 12^m=2^(2m)*3^m and set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n-1.
8. Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.
9. Study possible solutions of the the factor splitting.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This is a complex problem that requires a deep understanding of number theory. Let&#x27;s break it down step by step:

1. **Can the expression be 0?**
   No, because 12^m and 5^n are both positive integers, and there&#x27;s no way for them to be equal (since 12 and 5 are not powers of each other).

2. **Can the expression equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?**
   No, because 12^m and 5^n are both greater than these numbers for any positive integers m and n.

3. **Can 12^m - 5^n be 1?**
   Let&#x27;s express 5^n in terms of m and study its factors. We have 12^m = 5^n + 1. Since 12^m = (2^2 * 3)^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we can see that the left side of the equation is divisible by 4. However, for the right side of the equation, 5^n + 1 is only divisible by 4 when n is odd. Therefore, m must be odd.

4. **Can 5^n - 12^m be 1?**
   Consider the equation modulo 3. We have 5^n ≡ 2^n (mod 3). Since 12^m ≡ 0 (mod 3), we can see that n must be even for the equation 5^n - 12^m = 1 to hold.

5. **For even n, factor 5^n - 1 into P and Q and check their divisibility by 4.**
   We have 5^n - 1 = (5^(n/2) - 1)(5^(n/2) + 1) = PQ. Both P and Q are even, but only one of them is divisible by 4.

6. **Set up an equation to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1.**
   We have 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m = PQ. Since P and Q are not both divisible by 4, 2m must be odd, which means m is odd. Also, since P and Q are not both divisible by 3, m must be 1.

7. **Check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference.**
   We have Q - P = 2, which means only one of P and Q can be divisible by 3. Since m = 1, we have P = 4 and Q = 6 or P = 2 and Q = 4.

8. **Study possible solutions of the factor splitting.**
   The only solution that satisfies all conditions is m = 1 and n = 2.

Therefore, the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is |12^1 - 5^2| = |12 - 25| = 13.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The smallest value of |12^m - 5^n| for positive integers m and n is 13, which is achieved when m = 1 and n = 2.
