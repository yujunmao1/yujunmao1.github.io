<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find all integer solutions to the equation 15x^2-7y^2=9.
Step-wise solution:
1. Since 7y^2=15x^2-9 is a multiple of 3, y must be a multiple of 3.
2. Define y=3u, and we have 15x^2-63u^2=9.
3. Thus, 5x^2=21u^2+3, which means that x is a also multiple of 3.
4. Define x=3v and we have 45v^2=21u^2+3, and get 15v^2-1=7u^2.
5. Since 7u^2 mod 3=15v^2-1 mod 3=2, u^2 mod 3=2.
6. However, for any integer u, u^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1.
7. Thus, the original equation has no integer solution.

Problem: Find all integer solutions to the equation x^2-3y^2=17.
Step-wise solution:
1. For any integer x, we have x^2 mod 3âˆˆ{0, 1}.
2. We further have 3y^2 mod 3=0 and 17 mod 3=2.
3. Thus, the left hand side is 0 or 1 mod 3 while the right hand side is 2 mod 3.
4. So the equation has no integer solution.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Do there exist positive integers x, y such that x+y, x+2y and 2x+y are both squares?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s denote the squares as follows:

1. \( x + y = a^2 \) for some integer \( a \).
2. \( x + 2y = b^2 \) for some integer \( b \).
3. \( 2x + y = c^2 \) for some integer \( c \).

From these equations, we can derive two more equations by subtracting the first from the second and the first from the third:

4. \( x + 2y - (x + y) = b^2 - a^2 \) which simplifies to \( y = b^2 - a^2 \).
5. \( 2x + y - (x + y) = c^2 - a^2 \) which simplifies to \( x = c^2 - a^2 \).

Now we can substitute \( y \) from equation 4 into equation 1 to express \( x \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):

6. \( x + (b^2 - a^2) = a^2 \) which simplifies to \( x = 2a^2 - b^2 \).

Similarly, we can substitute \( x \) from equation 5 into equation 1 to express \( y \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):

7. \( (c^2 - a^2) + y = a^2 \) which simplifies to \( y = 2a^2 - c^2 \).

Now we have expressions for both \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\( x = 2a^2 - b^2 \)
\( y = 2a^2 - c^2 \)

We can now substitute these expressions into the equation \( x + 2y = b^2 \) to find a relationship between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\( (2a^2 - b^2) + 2(2a^2 - c^2) = b^2 \)
\( 2a^2 - b^2 + 4a^2 - 2c^2 = b^2 \)
\( 6a^2 - 2c^2 = 2b^2 \)
\( 3a^2 - c^2 = b^2 \)

Now we have a Diophantine equation in \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). We need to find positive integer solutions for this equation. Let&#x27;s rearrange it:

\( b^2 + c^2 = 3a^2 \)

This equation suggests that both \( b^2 \) and \( c^2 \) must be multiples of 3 since their sum is a multiple of 3. If \( b \) and \( c \) are not multiples of 3, their squares would be congruent to 1 modulo 3, and their sum would not be a multiple of 3. Therefore, \( b \) and \( c \) must be multiples of 3.

Let \( b = 3m \) and \( c = 3n \) for some integers \( m \) and \( n \). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\( (3m)^2 + (3n)^2 = 3a^2 \)
\( 9m^2 + 9n^2 = 3a^2 \)
\( 3m^2 + 3n^2 = a^2 \)

Now \( a^2 \) must also be a multiple of 3, which means \( a \) is a multiple of 3. Let \( a = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\( 3m^2 + 3n^2 = (3k)^2 \)
\( m^2 + n^2 = 3k^2 \)

We are back to a similar form of the equation we started with, suggesting that we have an infinite descent unless \( m \), \( n \), and \( k \) are all zero, which would not give us positive integers for \( x \) and \( y \).

However, we have not yet used the fact that \( x \), \( y \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are all positive integers. Let&#x27;s look at the original equations again:

\( x = 2a^2 - b^2 \)
\( y = 2a^2 - c^2 \)

For \( x \) and \( y \) to be positive, we need:

\( 2a^2 &gt; b^2 \)
\( 2a^2 &gt; c^2 \)

This means that \( a \) must be greater than both \( b/\sqrt{2} \) and \( c/\sqrt{2} \). Since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are integers, there must be a minimum positive integer value for \( a \) that satisfies these inequalities.

Let&#x27;s try to find a specific solution by trial and error. We can start with the smallest possible value for \( a \), which is 1, and then increase \( a \) to find a set of \( b \) and \( c \) that satisfy the equation \( b^2 + c^2 = 3a^2 \) and the inequalities above.

For \( a = 1 \), there are no positive integer solutions for \( b \) and \( c \) because \( b^2 + c^2 = 3 \) cannot be satisfied by positive integers.

For \( a = 2 \), we have \( b^2 + c^2 = 12 \). The pairs of positive integers that satisfy this are \( (b, c) = (2, 2) \), but this does not satisfy \( 2a^2 &gt; b^2 \) and \( 2a^2 &gt; c^2 \).

For \( a = 3 \), we have \( b^2 + c^2 = 27 \). There are no pairs of positive integers that satisfy this.

Continuing this process, we look for the smallest \( a \) such that \( b^2 + c^2 = 3a^2 \) has a solution in positive integers \( b \) and \( c \) that also satisfy \( 2a^2 &gt; b^2 \) and \( 2a^2 &gt; c^2 \).

However, we can notice that if \( a \) is not a multiple of 3, then \( b^2 + c^2 = 3a^2 \) cannot be satisfied by integers \( b \) and \( c \) because the left side would be divisible by 3 while the right side would not be. Therefore, \( a \) must be a multiple of 3, and we are back to the infinite descent problem.

This suggests that there are no positive integer solutions for \( x \), \( y \), \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy all the given conditions. Thus, there do not exist positive integers \( x \), \( y \) such that \( x+y \), \( x+2y \), and \( 2x+y \) are all squares.</code></pre>
