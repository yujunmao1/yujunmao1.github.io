<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: n people sit around a circular table. How many of the n! arrangements are distinct (i.e., do not have the same neighboring relations), as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. For each arrangement, a total of n rotations and 2 reflections all preserve the neighoring relationship.
2. Thus, the distinct number of arrangement is n!/(2n).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem involving permutations with a specific constraint. The constraint is that each driver must be able to park in a lot, which means that no driver can be blocked from parking by the arrangement of the favorite lots of the drivers ahead of them.

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of permutations of the sequence {a_1, ..., a_n} such that for each i, there is at least one free parking lot among the lots a_i, a_i+1, ..., n. This is equivalent to saying that there are no &quot;gaps&quot; in the parking arrangement where a driver would be unable to park because all lots up to his favorite are already taken.

The problem can be rephrased in terms of a well-known combinatorial object called a &quot;parking function.&quot; A parking function is a sequence {a_1, ..., a_n} of positive integers such that when the numbers are sorted in increasing order, the ith number in the sorted sequence is less than or equal to i. The number of parking functions of length n is known to be (n+1)^(n-1).

To see why this is the case, consider the sorted sequence of favorite lots. The first driver can choose any lot from 1 to n, the second driver can choose any lot from 1 to n-1 (since one lot is already taken), and so on, until the last driver who must choose lot number 1. However, since the drivers arrive in a specific order and may pass over their favorite lot if it&#x27;s taken, we need to consider the number of ways the drivers can be rearranged such that their preferences still form a parking function.

The number of parking functions of length n is a well-established result in combinatorial mathematics, and it is given by (n+1)^(n-1). Therefore, the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is (n+1)^(n-1).

In conclusion, the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park is (n+1)^(n-1).</code></pre>
