<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the smallest positive integer with the property described as an \( n \)-digit number:

\[ \overline{a_1a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_n} \]

where \( a_1 \) is the first digit and \( a_n \) is the last digit of the number. According to the problem, moving the first digit to the end gives us a new number which is 1.5 times the original number:

\[ 1.5 \times \overline{a_1a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_n} = \overline{a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_na_1} \]

Let&#x27;s express the original number and the new number in terms of their digits:

Original number: \( a_1 \times 10^{n-1} + a_2 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + a_{n-1} \times 10 + a_n \)

New number: \( a_2 \times 10^{n-1} + a_3 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + a_n \times 10 + a_1 \)

Now, we can set up the equation based on the problem statement:

\[ 1.5 \times (a_1 \times 10^{n-1} + a_2 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + a_{n-1} \times 10 + a_n) = a_2 \times 10^{n-1} + a_3 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + a_n \times 10 + a_1 \]

Simplifying, we get:

\[ 1.5 \times a_1 \times 10^{n-1} + 1.5 \times a_2 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + 1.5 \times a_{n-1} \times 10 + 1.5 \times a_n = a_2 \times 10^{n-1} + a_3 \times 10^{n-2} + ... + a_n \times 10 + a_1 \]

\[ 1.5 \times a_1 \times 10^{n-1} - a_1 = a_2 \times 10^{n-1} - 1.5 \times a_2 \times 10^{n-2} + a_3 \times 10^{n-2} - 1.5 \times a_3 \times 10^{n-3} + ... + a_n \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_n \]

Now, we can divide both sides by \( 10^{n-2} \) to simplify:

\[ 1.5 \times a_1 \times 10^2 - \frac{a_1}{10^{n-2}} = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} + ... + \frac{a_n}{10^{n-3}} - 1.5 \times \frac{a_n}{10^{n-2}} \]

Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer, \( a_1 \) cannot be 0 and must be a digit from 1 to 9. Also, the left side of the equation suggests that \( a_1 \) must be even because when we move it to the end, the resulting number is an integer, and since it&#x27;s 1.5 times the original number, the last digit of the original number must be even.

Let&#x27;s try the smallest even digit for \( a_1 \), which is 2:

\[ 1.5 \times 2 \times 10^2 - \frac{2}{10^{n-2}} = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} + ... + \frac{a_n}{10^{n-3}} - 1.5 \times \frac{a_n}{10^{n-2}} \]

\[ 300 - \frac{2}{10^{n-2}} = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} + ... + \frac{a_n}{10^{n-3}} - 1.5 \times \frac{a_n}{10^{n-2}} \]

Since we are looking for an integer solution, the term \( \frac{2}{10^{n-2}} \) must become negligible, which means \( n \) must be large enough for this term to effectively be 0 in the context of integer values. This suggests that the number we are looking for is likely not a small number in terms of the number of digits.

Let&#x27;s try to find a pattern by testing small values of \( n \) and see if we can identify a number that satisfies the condition. We can start with \( n = 2 \) and increase \( n \) until we find a solution.

For \( n = 2 \), we have:

\[ 1.5 \times a_1 \times 10 - a_1 = a_2 - 1.5 \times a_2 \]

Since \( a_1 \) is the first digit and we&#x27;ve chosen it to be 2, we have:

\[ 1.5 \times 2 \times 10 - 2 = a_2 - 1.5 \times a_2 \]

\[ 30 - 2 = a_2 - 1.5 \times a_2 \]

\[ 28 = -0.5 \times a_2 \]

\[ a_2 = -56 \]

This is not a valid digit, so \( n = 2 \) is not a solution. We need to try larger values of \( n \).

For \( n = 3 \), we have:

\[ 1.5 \times a_1 \times 100 - a_1 = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} \]

Again, with \( a_1 = 2 \):

\[ 1.5 \times 2 \times 100 - 2 = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} \]

\[ 300 - 2 = a_2 \times 10 - 1.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 1.5 \times \frac{a_3}{10} \]

\[ 298 = 8.5 \times a_2 + a_3 - 0.15 \times a_3 \]

This equation is more complex, and we need to find integer values for \( a_2 \) and \( a_3 \) that satisfy it. However, we can see that \( a_2 \) must be even, and \( a_3 \) must be such that \( 0.15 \times a_3 \) is an integer, which is not possible since \( a_3 \) is an integer and 0.15 is not an integer divisor of any integer.

We can continue this process, but it&#x27;s clear that the number of digits \( n \) must be larger to accommodate the condition that the new number is exactly 1.5 times the old number. Let&#x27;s try a different approach to find a pattern.

We know that the number we are looking for is of the form:

\[ \overline{a_1a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_n} \]

And when we move the first digit to the end, we get:

\[ \overline{a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_na_1} \]

Which is 1.5 times the original number. Let&#x27;s consider the smallest case where \( a_1 = 2 \) and see if we can find a pattern:

\[ 1.5 \times \overline{2a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_n} = \overline{a_2a_3...a_{n-1}a_n2} \]

Now, let&#x27;s think about what happens when we multiply a number by 1.5. Multiplying by 1.5 is the same as multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 2. When we multiply by 3, each digit triples, and we may have carries to the next digit. When we divide by 2, we are essentially halving the number, which could lead to a situation where the last digit becomes 5 if the original last digit was even.

Let&#x27;s try to construct such a number by starting with the last digit. If the last digit of the original number is \( a_n \), then after multiplying by 1.5, the last digit of the new number should be \( 1.5 \times a_n \). Since we want the last digit of the new number to be 2 (because we moved the first digit 2 to the end), we need \( a_n \) to be such that \( 1.5 \times a_n \) ends in 2. This is only possible if \( a_n \) is even.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_n = 8 \), which is the largest even digit less than 10. When we multiply 8 by 1.5, we get 12, which ends in 2. This is promising because it means the last digit of the new number could be 2, and we have a carry of 1 to the next digit.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the second to last digit \( a_{n-1} \). We have a carry of 1 from the multiplication of the last digit. If \( a_{n-1} \) is such that \( 1.5 \times a_{n-1} + 1 \) (including the carry) ends in 8 (since \( a_n = 8 \)), we can continue the pattern.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_{n-1} = 6 \). Multiplying 6 by 1.5 gives us 9, and adding the carry of 1 gives us 10, which ends in 0 and gives us a carry of 1 to the next digit. This is not correct since we need it to end in 8, not 0.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_{n-1} = 4 \). Multiplying 4 by 1.5 gives us 6, and adding the carry of 1 gives us 7, which does not end in 8.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_{n-1} = 2 \). Multiplying 2 by 1.5 gives us 3, and adding the carry of 1 gives us 4, which does not end in 8.

We need to find a digit such that when we multiply it by 1.5 and add a carry of 1, the result ends in 8. Let&#x27;s try \( a_{n-1} = 1 \). Multiplying 1 by 1.5 gives us 1.5, and adding the carry of 1 gives us 2.5, which is not an integer. We need to find an even digit since the result must be an integer.

Let&#x27;s try \( a_{n-1} = 0 \). Multiplying 0 by 1.5 gives us 0, and adding the carry of 1 gives us 1, which does not end in 8.

It seems we are not finding the correct second to last digit using this method. Let&#x27;s reconsider our approach and look for a pattern in the multiplication by 1.5.

When we multiply a number by 1.5, we are effectively multiplying by 3 and then dividing by 2. This means that if the last digit of the original number is even, the last digit of the new number will be 5 or 0 (since dividing an even number by 2 gives an integer, and multiplying by 3 does not change the evenness).

Since we want the last digit of the new number to be 2 (because we moved the first digit 2 to the end), the last digit of the original number cannot be even. This contradicts our earlier assumption that the last digit must be even. We need to find a digit that, when multiplied by 1.5, gives a result that ends in 2.

Let&#x27;s try odd digits for the last digit of the original number. The only odd digit that, when multiplied by 3, gives a result that ends in 6 (so that when divided by 2, it ends in 3) is 3 itself. Multiplying 3 by 3 gives us 9, and dividing by 2 gives us 4.5, which is not an integer.

We need to find an odd digit that, when multiplied by 3 and then divided by 2, gives an integer ending in 2. Let&#x27;s try the digit 4. Multiplying 4 by 3 gives us 12, and dividing by 2 gives us 6. This is not correct since we need it to end in 2.

Let&#x27;s try the digit 6. Multiplying 6 by 3 gives us 18, and dividing by 2 gives us 9. This is not correct since we need it to end in 2.

Let&#x27;s try the digit 8. Multiplying 8 by 3 gives us 24, and dividing by 2 gives us 12, which ends in 2. This is correct since we need it to end in </code></pre>
