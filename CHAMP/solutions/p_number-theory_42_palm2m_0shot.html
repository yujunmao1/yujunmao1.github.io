<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Fifty numbers a_1, a_2,..., a_50 are written along a circle. Each of the numbers is +1 or -1. You want to find the product of these numbers. You may find the product of three consecutive numbers in one question. How many questions do you need at least?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The product of any three consecutive numbers is always divisible by 6. This is because the product of any two consecutive numbers is always even, and the product of any three consecutive numbers is always odd. Therefore, if we know the product of any three consecutive numbers, we can determine the parity of the product of all 50 numbers.

To find the product of all 50 numbers, we can ask 25 questions. In each question, we can ask for the product of three consecutive numbers. The first question can be any three consecutive numbers. The second question can be any three consecutive numbers that are not the same as the three consecutive numbers in the first question. The third question can be any three consecutive numbers that are not the same as the three consecutive numbers in the first two questions, and so on.

After 25 questions, we will have asked for the product of all 50 numbers. We can then determine the parity of the product of all 50 numbers by looking at the parity of the products of the three consecutive numbers that we asked for in each question.

For example, suppose that the three consecutive numbers that we asked for in the first question are 1, 2, and 3. The product of these numbers is 6, which is even. The three consecutive numbers that we asked for in the second question are 4, 5, and 6. The product of these numbers is 120, which is also even. The three consecutive numbers that we asked for in the third question are 7, 8, and 9. The product of these numbers is 504, which is odd.

After 25 questions, we will have asked for the product of all 50 numbers. We can then determine the parity of the product of all 50 numbers by looking at the parity of the products of the three consecutive numbers that we asked for in each question. In this example, the parity of the product of all 50 numbers is odd.

Therefore, we need at least 25 questions to find the product of all 50 numbers.</code></pre>
