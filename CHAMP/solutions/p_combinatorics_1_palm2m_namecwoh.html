<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum is a mathematical formula that is used to find the probability of two events occurring together. The formula is P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B).

The rule of sum can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the probability of getting two heads in a row when flipping a coin, or finding the probability of getting two sixes when rolling two dice.

To use the rule of sum, you first need to find the probability of each event occurring individually. For example, the probability of getting heads when flipping a coin is 1/2. The probability of getting tails when flipping a coin is also 1/2.

Once you have found the probability of each event occurring individually, you can plug them into the rule of sum. For example, the probability of getting two heads in a row when flipping a coin is P(H and H) = P(H) + P(H) - P(H or H). This is equal to 1/2 + 1/2 - 1 = 1/2.

The rule of sum can also be used to find the probability of two events occurring together when one event is dependent on the other. For example, the probability of getting two sixes when rolling two dice is P(6 and 6) = P(6) * P(6). This is equal to 1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36.

The rule of sum is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a variety of problems in probability.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let a string consist of digit 1, 2, 3. How many such strings of length 6 have adjacent digit differing by less than or equal to 1?

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>There are 3 choices for each digit in the string, so there are $3^6 = 729$ possible strings of length 6. Of these, there are 6 strings that have all the same digit, 12 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 1, 20 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 2, and 12 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 3. This leaves 729 - 6 - 12 - 20 - 12 = 669 strings that have adjacent digits differing by less than or equal to 1.

Here is a more detailed solution:

We can think of the strings as being made up of 6 &quot;blocks&quot;, each of which can be any of the digits 1, 2, or 3. There are 3 choices for each block, so there are $3^6 = 729$ possible strings of length 6.

Of these, there are 6 strings that have all the same digit. For example, the string &quot;111111&quot; has all the same digit, 1.

There are 12 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 1. For example, the string &quot;121212&quot; has two adjacent digits that are different by 1, 1 and 2.

There are 20 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 2. For example, the string &quot;123232&quot; has two adjacent digits that are different by 2, 1 and 2.

There are 12 strings that have two adjacent digits that are different by 3. For example, the string &quot;123323&quot; has two adjacent digits that are different by 3, 1 and 2.

This leaves 729 - 6 - 12 - 20 - 12 = 669 strings that have adjacent digits differing by less than or equal to 1.</code></pre>
