Is 4^545+545^4 a prime number?

You may find the following information useful:

1. 545=136*4+1.
2. A polynomial f(x) of an even degree with a positive leading coefficient has a global minimum, at which location f&#x27;(x)=0.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To determine if \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is a prime number, we can look for patterns or properties that might help us identify whether the number is divisible by something other than 1 and itself.

First, let&#x27;s consider the properties of the numbers involved:

1. \(545 = 136 \times 4 + 1\)

This information might not seem directly useful at first, but let&#x27;s keep it in mind.

2. A polynomial \(f(x)\) of an even degree with a positive leading coefficient has a global minimum, at which location \(f&#x27;(x) = 0\).

This property is about polynomials, but our expression \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is not a polynomial in the variable \(x\), so this information might not be directly applicable. However, it might be hinting at considering the parity of the exponents or the behavior of functions, which could lead to insights about the sum.

Now, let&#x27;s look at the expression \(4^{545} + 545^4\). We can see that \(4^{545}\) is a power of 4 raised to an odd exponent, and \(545^4\) is a power of 545 raised to an even exponent. The sum of these two terms is what we&#x27;re interested in.

One thing we can notice is that \(4^{545}\) is congruent to \(4^1\) modulo 5 because 4 raised to any odd power will end in 4, and \(545^4\) is congruent to \(0^4\) modulo 5 because 545 ends in 5, and any number ending in 5 raised to any power will end in 5.

So, modulo 5, we have:

\(4^{545} \equiv 4 \mod 5\)
\(545^4 \equiv 0 \mod 5\)

Adding these congruences, we get:

\(4^{545} + 545^4 \equiv 4 + 0 \mod 5\)
\(4^{545} + 545^4 \equiv 4 \mod 5\)

This means that \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is not divisible by 5, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it&#x27;s prime.

However, we can also consider the expression modulo 2. Since 4 is a power of 2, \(4^{545}\) will be even, and since \(545^4\) is a power of an odd number, it will also be odd. The sum of an even and an odd number is odd, so \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is odd and not divisible by 2.

At this point, we have not found a divisor, but we have not proven that the number is prime either. To prove that a number is prime, we would need to show that it has no divisors other than 1 and itself, which is a non-trivial task for large numbers like this one.

However, we can use a simple parity argument to show that \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is not prime. Notice that both \(4^{545}\) and \(545^4\) are congruent to 1 modulo 4 because:

- \(4^{545}\) is a power of 4, so it is of the form \(4k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).
- \(545^4\) can be written as \((544 + 1)^4\), and expanding this using the binomial theorem, every term except the last will be a multiple of 544 (which is a multiple of 4), so the last term, \(1^4\), will determine the congruence modulo 4.

Thus, we have:

\(4^{545} \equiv 1 \mod 4\)
\(545^4 \equiv 1 \mod 4\)

Adding these congruences, we get:

\(4^{545} + 545^4 \equiv 1 + 1 \mod 4\)
\(4^{545} + 545^4 \equiv 2 \mod 4\)

This shows that \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is even, which contradicts our earlier observation that it is odd. This contradiction arises from an error in our reasoning. Let&#x27;s correct this:

Actually, \(4^{545}\) is a power of 4 raised to an odd exponent, so it is indeed even (not odd as previously stated). Therefore, \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is the sum of an even number and an odd number, which is odd. This means that the number cannot be divisible by 2, which is consistent with our earlier observation.

However, the fact that \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is odd does not guarantee that it is prime. To determine primality, we would need to perform a primality test or factor the number, which is computationally intensive for such a large number.

In conclusion, we have not proven that \(4^{545} + 545^4\) is prime. We have only shown that it is not divisible by 2 or 5. To determine its primality, further analysis or computational methods would be required.</code></pre>
