<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! The concept you&#x27;re referring to is known as a &quot;combination,&quot; which is a way of selecting items from a larger set such that the order of selection does not matter. The notation C(n, k) is often read as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is mathematically defined as:

\[ C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, the product of all positive integers up to that number (e.g., 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate this concept:

Suppose you have a group of 5 friends, and you want to invite 3 of them to a dinner party. You&#x27;re interested in how many different groups of 3 friends you can invite without considering the order in which you invite them.

Using the combination formula, you can calculate the number of ways to choose 3 friends out of 5 as follows:

\[ C(5, 3) = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{(3 \times 2 \times 1)(2 \times 1)} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 different ways to choose 3 friends from a group of 5.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is an application of the fundamental counting principle, which states that if you have a series of decisions or steps to make, and each step has a certain number of independent choices, then the total number of ways to complete the entire series is the product of the number of choices at each step.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Imagine you&#x27;re getting dressed and you have to decide on your outfit, which consists of a shirt, pants, and a pair of shoes. You have the following options:

- Shirts: You have 4 different shirts to choose from.
- Pants: You have 3 different pairs of pants to choose from.
- Shoes: You have 2 different pairs of shoes to choose from.

To find the total number of different outfits you can put together, you multiply the number of choices for each item of clothing:

\[ p_1 \times p_2 \times p_3 = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \]

So, you have:

\[ 4 \text{ (shirts)} \times 3 \text{ (pants)} \times 2 \text{ (shoes)} = 24 \text{ different outfits} \]

Therefore, there are 24 different ways to choose an outfit from your wardrobe options.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is another application of the fundamental counting principle, specifically when you have mutually exclusive choices for performing an action. This means that you can perform only one action at a time, and the total number of ways to perform the action is the sum of the individual ways to perform each action.

Here&#x27;s an example:

Suppose you have a free evening and you&#x27;re trying to decide what to do. You have three options, but you can only choose one because they all take up the entire evening:

1. Go to the movies: There are 5 different movies playing at your local theater that you&#x27;re interested in seeing.
2. Read a book: You have 3 different books on your shelf that you&#x27;ve been meaning to read.
3. Play a video game: You have 2 new video games that you haven&#x27;t started yet.

Since you can only choose one activity for the evening, the total number of ways you can spend your evening is the sum of the ways to perform each individual activity:

\[ p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 5 + 3 + 2 \]

So, you have:

\[ 5 \text{ (movies)} + 3 \text{ (books)} + 2 \text{ (video games)} = 10 \text{ different ways to spend your evening} \]

Therefore, there are 10 different ways you can choose to spend your evening based on these mutually exclusive activities.</code></pre>

Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
2. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are the same person, by first selecting the president, and then the rest of the committee (of any number).
3. Find the number of ways to select such a committee when the president and the secretary are different people, by first selecting the president, then the secretary, and finally the rest of the committee (of any number).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will interpret the expression as the number of ways to choose a committee from n people, while also selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.

Let&#x27;s break it down into two cases:

**Case 1: The president and the secretary are the same person.**

In this case, we first choose the president (who will also be the secretary) from the n people, which can be done in n ways. Then, we choose the rest of the committee from the remaining n-1 people. Since the committee can be of any size, including just the president/secretary, we have \(2^{n-1}\) ways to choose the rest of the committee (each person can either be on the committee or not).

So, the total number of ways for this case is \(n \cdot 2^{n-1}\).

**Case 2: The president and the secretary are different people.**

In this case, we first choose the president from the n people, which can be done in n ways. Then, we choose the secretary from the remaining n-1 people, which can be done in n-1 ways. Finally, we choose the rest of the committee from the remaining n-2 people, which can be done in \(2^{n-2}\) ways.

So, the total number of ways for this case is \(n \cdot (n-1) \cdot 2^{n-2}\).

Now, let&#x27;s sum the two cases to find the total number of ways to form the committee with a president and a secretary:

Total = Case 1 + Case 2
\[ = n \cdot 2^{n-1} + n \cdot (n-1) \cdot 2^{n-2} \]
\[ = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (2 + (n-1)) \]
\[ = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (n+1) \]

This is the closed-form formula for the sum of \(C(n, k) \cdot k^2\) from \(k=1\) to \(n\):

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n} C(n, k) \cdot k^2 = n \cdot 2^{n-2} \cdot (n+1) \]

This formula represents the total number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.</code></pre>
