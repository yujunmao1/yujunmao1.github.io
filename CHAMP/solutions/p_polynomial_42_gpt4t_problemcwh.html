<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a monic polynomial (i.e. a polynomial with the leading coefficient being 1) p(x) of degree greater than 1 that satisfies x*p(x-1)=(x-2023)*p(x).
Step-wise solution:
1. Plugging x=0 into the equation, we get -2023p(0)=0, so p(0)=0 and 0 is a root of p(x).
2. Plugging x=1 into the equation, we get -2022p(1)=p(0)=0, so p(1)=0 and 1 is a root.
3. Plugging x=2 into the equation, we get -2021p(2)=2p(1)=0, so p(2)=0 and 2 is a root.
4. This process can continue to x=2022, where we get -p(2022)=2022p(2021)=0 and 2022 is a root.
5. We cannot continue because at x=2023, we have 0*p(2023)=0, but p(2023) is not necessarily 0.
6. So we have identified the roots 0, 1, ..., 2022, which means that p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2022)f(x) for some f(x).
7. Plugging this into the original equation, we have x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2023)f(x-1)=(x-2023)x(x-1)...(x-2022)f(x) for all x.
8. So we need to have f(x)=f(x-1) for all x.
9. The only possible value of f(x) to make p(x) a monic polynomial of degree more than 1 is thus f(x)=1.
10. So we have p(x)=x(x-1)(x-2)...(x-2022).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let f(x) be a polynomial of degree n with integer coefficients. If there are three different integers a, b, c, such that f(a)=f(b)=f(c)=-1, then at most how many integer-valued roots can this polynomial have?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study the root of the polynomial g(x)=f(x)+1.
2. Study the factorization of g(k) for an integer-valued root k of f(x).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s first consider the polynomial g(x) = f(x) + 1. Since f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = -1 for three different integers a, b, and c, we have g(a) = g(b) = g(c) = 0. This means that a, b, and c are roots of g(x).

Now, let&#x27;s consider any integer-valued root k of f(x). Since k is a root of f(x), we have f(k) = 0, and therefore g(k) = f(k) + 1 = 1. This means that for any integer-valued root k of f(x), g(k) is not zero, and k is not a root of g(x).

Since g(x) has a degree of n (the same as f(x)), it can have at most n roots by the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. We already know that a, b, and c are three distinct roots of g(x), so there are at most n - 3 other roots that g(x) can have.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the integer-valued roots of f(x). Each of these roots corresponds to a value of x where g(x) = 1. Since g(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, the difference g(x) - g(x-1) is also a polynomial with integer coefficients, and it has a degree of n - 1 (since the leading terms cancel out).

For any two consecutive integers m and m+1 that are roots of f(x), we have g(m) = 1 and g(m+1) = 1. This implies that g(m) - g(m-1) = 0, meaning that m is a root of the polynomial g(x) - g(x-1). Since g(x) - g(x-1) has a degree of n - 1, it can have at most n - 1 roots.

However, we must also consider that the roots of f(x) are not necessarily consecutive integers. To maximize the number of integer-valued roots of f(x), we would want to space them out so that they are not roots of g(x) - g(x-1). The best way to do this is to have them alternate with the roots of g(x), but since we already have three fixed roots a, b, and c, we can place at most n - 3 - 1 integer-valued roots of f(x) in between the roots of g(x) without creating consecutive integer roots.

Therefore, the maximum number of integer-valued roots that f(x) can have is (n - 3) + (n - 3 - 1) = 2n - 7.

In conclusion, a polynomial f(x) of degree n with integer coefficients, and with three different integers a, b, c such that f(a) = f(b) = f(c) = -1, can have at most 2n - 7 integer-valued roots.</code></pre>
