<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A number is a multiple of 3 if and only if its digit sum is divisible by 3.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Certainly! Let&#x27;s take the number 351 as an example.

To apply the concept, we need to find the sum of the digits of 351:

3 + 5 + 1 = 9

Now we check if the digit sum (9) is divisible by 3:

9 ÷ 3 = 3

Since 9 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, the digit sum is indeed divisible by 3. According to the concept, this means that the original number (351) should also be a multiple of 3.

To verify this, we can divide 351 by 3:

351 ÷ 3 = 117

Since 351 is divisible by 3 with no remainder, we have confirmed that 351 is a multiple of 3, which is consistent with the concept that if the digit sum of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is a multiple of 3.</code></pre>

Let a be a positive integer and p be a prime. Then a^p≡a mod p.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This concept is known as Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). However, it can also be stated in the form you&#x27;ve given, which is \( a^p \equiv a \mod p \), and this form holds for any integer \( a \), including those divisible by \( p \).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with \( a = 4 \) and \( p = 5 \), where 5 is a prime number.

According to Fermat&#x27;s Little Theorem, we should find that \( 4^5 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \).

Calculating \( 4^5 \):

\( 4^5 = 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 \times 4 = 1024 \)

Now we check the congruence:

\( 1024 \mod 5 = 4 \)

Since the remainder when 1024 is divided by 5 is indeed 4, we have \( 1024 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), which confirms the theorem for this example.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If a | bc and gcd(a, b)=1, then a | c.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is a fundamental property of divisibility and the greatest common divisor (gcd). It states that if a positive integer \( a \) divides the product of two integers \( b \) and \( c \), and \( a \) is coprime to \( b \) (meaning that \( a \) and \( b \) have a gcd of 1), then \( a \) must divide \( c \).

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example:

Let \( a = 7 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = 14 \).

First, we check that \( a | bc \):
\( bc = 6 \times 14 = 84 \),
and \( 84 \) is divisible by \( 7 \) since \( 84 \div 7 = 12 \). So, \( 7 | 84 \).

Next, we verify that \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \):
The divisors of \( 7 \) are \( 1 \) and \( 7 \), and the divisors of \( 6 \) are \( 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 6 \). The only common divisor is \( 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \).

Now, according to the concept, since \( 7 | 84 \) (where \( 84 = 6 \times 14 \)) and \( \gcd(7, 6) = 1 \), it must follow that \( 7 | 14 \).

Indeed, \( 14 \) is divisible by \( 7 \) since \( 14 \div 7 = 2 \). So, \( 7 | 14 \), which confirms the concept with this example.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Starting from a number x_1, form a sequence x_2, x_3, x_4... by appending one digit from 0 to 8 (i.e., 9 is not allowed) to the previous number. Can there be finitely many composite numbers in this sequence?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?
2. Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?
3. Starting with a prime p, would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s consider the information provided and the questions one by one:

1. **Appending what digits would immediately produce a composite number?**
   Appending the digit 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 to any number will immediately produce an even number (if the original number was even) or a number ending in 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, which are all composite because they are divisible by 2 or 5 (except when the original number is a single digit and the result is 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8, which are prime).

2. **Appending what digits would produce a multiple of 3 periodically?**
   To determine if appending a digit produces a multiple of 3, we need to consider the digit sum property. If the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by 3, then the number itself is divisible by 3. Appending a digit \( d \) to a number \( x \) results in a new number \( 10x + d \). If \( x \) is not a multiple of 3, then there are certain digits \( d \) that, when added to the digit sum of \( x \), will make the sum divisible by 3, thus making the new number a multiple of 3. This will happen periodically as the sequence progresses.

3. **Starting with a prime \( p \), would appending only digit 3 eventually produce a composite number?**
   Let&#x27;s consider a prime number \( p \) and start appending the digit 3 to it. The resulting numbers will be \( p \), \( p3 \), \( p33 \), \( p333 \), and so on. We need to determine if this process can eventually produce a composite number.

   Since we are only appending the digit 3, we are not immediately producing a composite number by the criteria of question 1 (since 3 is not 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8). However, we need to consider the periodicity of creating multiples of 3.

   If \( p \) is not a multiple of 3 (which it cannot be, since it&#x27;s a prime greater than 3), appending the digit 3 repeatedly will eventually create a number whose digit sum is a multiple of 3. This is because the digit sum will keep increasing by 3 each time we append the digit 3, and since the sum of digits cycles through the residues modulo 3 (0, 1, 2), it will eventually hit a sum that is a multiple of 3, making the number itself a multiple of 3 and thus composite.

Given these considerations, we can conclude that there cannot be finitely many composite numbers in the sequence. Regardless of the starting number \( x_1 \), by appending the digit 3 repeatedly, we will eventually reach a number whose digit sum is a multiple of 3, making the number composite. Since we can keep appending the digit 3 indefinitely, we will keep encountering composite numbers at regular intervals. Therefore, the sequence will contain infinitely many composite numbers.</code></pre>
