<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Of 3n+1 objects, n are indistinguishable, and the remaining ones are distinct. In how many ways can we choose n objects, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We have 2n+1 distinguishable objects and n indistinguishable objects.
2. Thus, to choose a collection contains k distinguishable objects, there are C(2n+1, k) ways.
3. So the total number of ways is C(2n+1, 0)+C(2n+1, 1)+...+C(2n+1, n).
4. Denote C(2n+1, k) as c_k.
5. We have c_0+c_1+...+c_(2n)+c_(2n+1)=2^(2n+1).
6. Furthermore, we have c_0=c_(2n+1), c_1=c_(2n), ..., c_n=c_(n+1).
7. Thus, we have c_0+c_1+...+c_n=2^(2n+1)/2=4^n.

Problem: There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?
Step-wise solution:
1. For the three children, we can select two boys and one girl, or three boys.
2. There are C(4, 2)*C(6, 1) ways to perform the first selection.
3. We can also select three boys.
4. There are C(4, 3) ways to select three boys.
5. For each selection, there are 3! ways to give the three toys.
6. Thus, the total number of ways is (C(4, 2)*C(6, 1)+C(4, 3))*3!=(6*6+4)*6=240.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Study if we can consider the 3 apple trees as indistinguishable, and 5 other trees as indistinguishable.
2. Consider a row of 5 dots, and place 3 dividers in between and/or at the two ends.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of planting the trees such that no two apple trees are next to each other, we can use the principle of complementary counting or direct counting. In this case, we will use direct counting with the help of the &quot;stars and bars&quot; method (which is hinted at in the additional information).

First, let&#x27;s consider the 5 non-apple trees (3 peach and 2 cherry). Since they are all distinct, we will treat them as distinguishable. We can arrange these 5 trees in a row in 5! ways.

Now, we want to place the 3 apple trees among these 5 trees such that no two apple trees are adjacent. We can think of the spaces between and at the ends of these 5 trees as potential spots for the apple trees. There are 6 such spots (before the first tree, between each pair of trees, and after the last tree).

To ensure that no two apple trees are adjacent, we will place the apple trees in 3 of these 6 spots. This is similar to placing 3 dividers among 5 dots, where the dots represent the non-apple trees and the dividers represent the apple trees.

The number of ways to place 3 dividers in 6 spots is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the number of spots and k is the number of dividers:

C(6, 3) = 6! / (3! * (6 - 3)!) = (6 * 5 * 4) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 20.

So, there are 20 ways to place the apple trees such that no two are adjacent.

Now, let&#x27;s calculate the total number of ways to arrange all 8 trees without any restrictions. Since the trees are distinct, there are 8! ways to arrange them.

The probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

Probability = (Number of favorable arrangements) / (Total number of arrangements)
            = (20 * 5!) / 8!
            = (20 * 120) / (40320)
            = 2400 / 40320
            = 1 / 16.8
            â‰ˆ 0.05952.

Therefore, the probability that no two apple trees are next to each other is approximately 0.05952, or about 5.952%.</code></pre>
