<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: 8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?
Step-wise solution:
1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white.
2. We can derive 8 numbers, being the numbers of white dots to the left of the first black dot, in between each black dots, and to the right of the last black dot.
3. Obviously each number is non-negative and all numbers sum up to 3.
4. Thus, we can consider this as one possible result of the fight.
5. Furthermore, each fight result can also be encoded as a dot configuration.
6. So there are C(10, 7)=C(10, 3)=120 possible results.

Problem: A gardener plants 3 apple trees, 3 peach trees and 2 cherry trees in a row, with a random order. What is the probability that no two apple trees are next two each other?
Step-wise solution:
1. Since we are only interested in the probability of no-adjacent-apple-tree configuration, we do not need to distinguish among the 3 apple trees, nor do we need to distinguish among the 5 other threes.
2. We consider a row of 5 dots, representing the 5 other trees.
3. We can place 3 dividers into 6 locations (1 on each side and 4 in the middle), which corresponds to a unique configuration of planting 3 apple trees among 5 other trees, with no adjacent apple trees.
4. We have C(6, 3)=20 ways to do it.
5. To calculate the total number of ways of planting 3 apple trees and 5 other trees, we select 3 locations among 8 slots, with C(8, 3) ways to do it.
6. Thus, the probability is C(6, 3)/C(8, 3)=20/(8*7*6/(3*2*1))=5*4*3*2*1/(8*7*6)=5/14.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let 1≤r≤n and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, ..., n}. What is the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. Consider the subsets of {0, 1, ..., n} and define a mapping f from these subsets to the subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element (e.g., f({0, 2, 3, 5})={2, 3, 5}).
2. For f(x)=y, where x and y are the two subsets, how many x map to the same y?
3. Relate the number of all possible x to the sum of the smallest element of all possible y.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s consider the mapping f mentioned in the additional information.

1. We have a set {0, 1, ..., n} and we want to find the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of all subsets of size r.
2. We can define a mapping f from these subsets to the subsets of {1, ..., n} by removing the smallest element.
3. For example, if we have the subset {0, 2, 3, 5}, f({0, 2, 3, 5})={2, 3, 5}.
4. Now, let&#x27;s consider f(x)=y, where x and y are the two subsets.
5. How many x map to the same y? Well, for any y, there are exactly n-r+1 subsets of size r that map to y.
6. This is because for any y, we can choose the smallest element of y from the set {0, 1, ..., n-r}.
7. So, for each y, there are n-r+1 subsets of size r that map to y.
8. Now, let&#x27;s relate the number of all possible x to the sum of the smallest element of all possible y.
9. The number of all possible x is given by the binomial coefficient C(n, r).
10. The sum of the smallest element of all possible y is the sum of the numbers from 1 to n-r+1, which is given by the formula (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2.
11. Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets is (n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2 / C(n, r).

So, the arithmetic mean of the smallest element of these subsets, as an expression of n and r, is:

(n-r+1)(n-r+2)/2 / C(n, r)</code></pre>
