<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple stages or events, and each stage or event is independent of the others.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, then the total number of ways both events can occur together is \( m \times n \). This can be extended to any number of events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for all \( k \) events is the product \( m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of product:

Suppose you are choosing an outfit consisting of a shirt and a pair of pants. If you have 5 different shirts and 3 different pairs of pants, the rule of product tells us that there are \( 5 \times 3 = 15 \) possible outfits you can create.

The rule of product applies only when the choices are independent, meaning the choice of one item does not affect the choices of the others. If the choices are not independent, then the rule of product cannot be directly applied, and other combinatorial methods must be used to find the total number of outcomes.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of sum.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of sum, also known as the addition principle, is another fundamental concept in combinatorics and probability theory. It is used to determine the total number of possible outcomes when there are multiple mutually exclusive events or choices.

The rule states that if one event can occur in \( m \) ways and a second event can occur in \( n \) ways, and the two events cannot occur at the same time (they are mutually exclusive), then the total number of ways either event can occur is \( m + n \). This principle can be extended to any number of mutually exclusive events: if there are \( k \) events, with the first event having \( m_1 \) outcomes, the second event having \( m_2 \) outcomes, ..., and the \( k \)-th event having \( m_k \) outcomes, then the total number of outcomes for any one of the \( k \) events to occur is the sum \( m_1 + m_2 + \cdots + m_k \).

Here&#x27;s an example to illustrate the rule of sum:

Suppose you are deciding how to travel to a nearby city. You can either take a bus or a train. If there are 3 different buses and 2 different trains that can take you to your destination, and you must choose either the bus or the train (not both), the rule of sum tells us that there are \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) possible travel options.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of sum applies only when the events are mutually exclusive, which means that the occurrence of one event precludes the occurrence of the others. If the events are not mutually exclusive, then the total number of outcomes is not simply the sum of the individual counts, and you may need to use more advanced combinatorial methods, such as inclusion-exclusion principle, to find the correct total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

A one-to-one mapping p: {1, 2, ..., n}-&gt;{1, 2, ..., n} is called an involution, if p∘p=identity (i.e., p(p(i))=i for all i∈{1, ..., n}). Find the number of involutions on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let T(n) be the number of involutions on {1, 2, ..., n}.
2. Find T(1) and T(2).
3. To construct an involution on size-n set by extending involutions on size-(n-1) set, we can either add {n-&gt;n} or add {n-&gt;i, i-&gt;n} to existing involutions.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we will use the given information to find the number of involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} by first finding \( T(1) \) and \( T(2) \), and then building up to \( T(6) \).

1. \( T(1) \): There is only one element in the set, so the only involution is the identity mapping, which maps the element to itself. Therefore, \( T(1) = 1 \).

2. \( T(2) \): There are two elements in the set. The involutions are the identity mapping (1 -&gt; 1, 2 -&gt; 2) and the transposition (1 -&gt; 2, 2 -&gt; 1). Therefore, \( T(2) = 2 \).

Now, let&#x27;s find \( T(n) \) for \( n &gt; 2 \) using the recursive construction method described:

3. \( T(3) \): To construct an involution on a 3-element set, we can extend the involutions on a 2-element set in two ways:
   - Add {3 -&gt; 3} to each of the 2 involutions of the 2-element set, which gives us 2 involutions.
   - Pair 3 with each of the other 2 elements, which gives us 2 more involutions (since 3 can be paired with either 1 or 2).
   Therefore, \( T(3) = T(2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \).

4. \( T(4) \): Similarly, to construct an involution on a 4-element set, we can:
   - Add {4 -&gt; 4} to each of the 4 involutions of the 3-element set, which gives us 4 involutions.
   - Pair 4 with each of the other 3 elements, which gives us 3 more involutions (since 4 can be paired with 1, 2, or 3).
   Therefore, \( T(4) = T(3) + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 \).

5. \( T(5) \): To construct an involution on a 5-element set, we can:
   - Add {5 -&gt; 5} to each of the 7 involutions of the 4-element set, which gives us 7 involutions.
   - Pair 5 with each of the other 4 elements, which gives us 4 more involutions (since 5 can be paired with 1, 2, 3, or 4).
   Therefore, \( T(5) = T(4) + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11 \).

6. \( T(6) \): Finally, to construct an involution on a 6-element set, we can:
   - Add {6 -&gt; 6} to each of the 11 involutions of the 5-element set, which gives us 11 involutions.
   - Pair 6 with each of the other 5 elements, which gives us 5 more involutions (since 6 can be paired with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).
   Therefore, \( T(6) = T(5) + 5 = 11 + 5 = 16 \).

So, the number of involutions on the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is \( T(6) = 16 \).</code></pre>
