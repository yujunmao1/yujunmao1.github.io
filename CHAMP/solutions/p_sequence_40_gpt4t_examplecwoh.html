<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;ve described is not generally true for counting the total number of ways to perform actions. The formula p_1 + p_2 + ... + p_n would only apply if you are choosing exactly one action to perform out of the n possible actions. This is an application of the Addition Principle in combinatorics, which states that if you have a set of exclusive and exhaustive choices, the total number of possibilities is the sum of the number of choices for each option.

Here&#x27;s an example that applies this concept correctly:

Suppose you are deciding what to drink for breakfast, and you have three types of beverages to choose from, but you will only drink one type of beverage. The options and the number of ways you can choose each are as follows:

1. Coffee (p_1): You have 4 different types of coffee to choose from.
2. Tea (p_2): You have 3 different types of tea to choose from.
3. Juice (p_3): You have 2 different types of juice to choose from.

Since you will choose exactly one beverage to drink, and you cannot drink coffee, tea, and juice at the same time, the total number of different beverage choices you have is the sum of the choices for each beverage:

Total number of ways = p_1 + p_2 + p_3
Total number of ways = 4 (coffees) + 3 (teas) + 2 (juices)
Total number of ways = 9

So, there are 9 different ways you can choose your breakfast beverage.

However, if you were to perform actions sequentially or in combination, the correct way to count the total number of ways to perform all actions would be to use the Multiplication Principle, which states that if you have a series of actions that can be performed in sequence, the total number of ways to perform all actions is the product of the number of ways to perform each action. In that case, the formula would be p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let a_n be the number of all permutations p of {1, ..., n} with min(n-|p(i)−i|, |p(i)−i|)≤1 for all i. Find a_10.

You may find the above concept helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The problem is asking us to find the number of permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n} such that for each element i in the permutation p, the distance between i and its position in the permutation p(i) is at most 1. This means that each element i can either stay in its original position i, or it can be swapped with the element immediately before or after it (i-1 or i+1).

Let&#x27;s denote a_n as the number of such permutations for a set of size n. We want to find a_10.

To build up to a_10, let&#x27;s start with smaller cases and look for a pattern.

For n = 1, there is only one permutation: {1}. So a_1 = 1.

For n = 2, there are two permutations: {1, 2} and {2, 1}. So a_2 = 2.

For n = 3, we have to consider the constraints. The permutations are {1, 2, 3}, {1, 3, 2}, {2, 1, 3}. So a_3 = 3.

For n = 4, we can build on the permutations for n = 3 by adding the fourth element. The new element can either go in its natural position or swap with the element before it. This gives us two options for each of the a_3 permutations. However, we need to be careful with the permutation {2, 1, 3} from the n = 3 case, as adding 4 in the last position would violate the condition for the element 3. So we have 2*a_3 - 1 permutations. Thus, a_4 = 2*3 - 1 = 5.

For n = 5, we can use a similar approach. Each of the a_4 permutations can be extended by placing the fifth element in its natural position or swapping it with the fourth element. However, we need to subtract the permutations that would violate the condition for the element 4. We can see that for n = 4, there is only one permutation that would cause an issue when extended to n = 5: {2, 1, 4, 3}. So a_5 = 2*a_4 - 1 = 2*5 - 1 = 9.

Continuing this pattern, we can derive a recursive formula for a_n:

a_n = 2*a_(n-1) - 1, for n &gt; 3

Using this recursive formula, we can calculate a_10:

a_6 = 2*a_5 - 1 = 2*9 - 1 = 17
a_7 = 2*a_6 - 1 = 2*17 - 1 = 33
a_8 = 2*a_7 - 1 = 2*33 - 1 = 65
a_9 = 2*a_8 - 1 = 2*65 - 1 = 129
a_10 = 2*a_9 - 1 = 2*129 - 1 = 257

Therefore, a_10 = 257.</code></pre>
