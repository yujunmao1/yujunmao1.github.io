<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Among all strings of length n consisting of digit 1, 2, 3 and 4, how many of them have an even number of 1s, as an expression of n?
Step-wise solution:
1. We define P(k) as the number of strings with k number of 1s, so P(k)=C(n, k)*3^(n-k).
2. Thus, the number of length-n strings with an even number of 1s is E(n)=P(0)+P(2)+...=C(n, 0)*3^n+C(n, 2)*3^(n-2)....
3. The number of length-n strings with an odd number of 1s is O(n)=P(1)+P(3)+...=C(n, 1)*3^(n-1)+C(n, 3)*3^(n-3)....
4. We have E(n)+O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*1^k=(3+1)^n=4^n.
5. In addition, E(n)-O(n)=sum_(k=0)^n C(n, k)*3^(n-k)*(-1)^k=(3-1)^n=2^n.
6. Thus, E(n)=(4^n+2^n)/2.

Problem: Each of the faces of a cube is painted by a different color. How many of the colorings are distinct up to rotations?
Step-wise solution:
1. We paint a face and put it on the bottom, and consider painting the second face.
2. We can paint it on top, the remaining four faces have 4! colorings, but we can rotate the cube four times, which makes four colorings the same, so we 4!/4=6 distinct colorings.
3. If the second face is on the side, we can put it on the front, and the two faces uniquely fix the rotation.
4. Thus, any coloring of the remaining four faces is distinct, and we have 4!=24 colorings.
5. In total, we have 30 colorings.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 4 horses go through the finish (with possibility of ties)?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve the problem of counting the number of ways 4 horses can finish a race with the possibility of ties, we need to consider the different scenarios of ties and no ties. We will use the concept of partitions to count the number of ways the horses can finish.

Let&#x27;s denote the horses as A, B, C, and D. We will consider the following cases:

1. No ties (all horses finish in a unique order):
There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to arrange the 4 horses in unique positions. This is because the first place can be taken by any of the 4 horses, the second place by any of the remaining 3 horses, the third place by either of the remaining 2 horses, and the last place by the remaining horse. So, 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ways.

2. One tie and two unique places:
This can happen in the following ways:
- Two horses tie for the first place, and the other two take the second and third places. There are C(4, 2) ways to choose the 2 horses that tie, and 2! ways to arrange the remaining horses. So, C(4, 2) × 2! = 6 × 2 = 12 ways.
- Two horses tie for the second place, and the other two take the first and third places. This is similar to the previous case, so another 12 ways.
- Two horses tie for the third place, and the other two take the first and second places. Again, this is similar, so another 12 ways.

3. Two pairs of ties:
There are C(4, 2) ways to choose the first pair of horses that tie, and then the remaining two horses automatically form the second pair. So, C(4, 2) = 6 ways.

4. Three horses tie and one unique place:
- Three horses tie for the first place, and one horse takes the second place. There are C(4, 3) ways to choose the 3 horses that tie, and the remaining horse is in the second place. So, C(4, 3) = 4 ways.
- Three horses tie for the second place, and one horse takes the first place. This is similar to the previous case, so another 4 ways.

5. All horses tie:
There is only 1 way for all horses to tie.

Now, we add up all the ways from the different cases:

No ties: 24 ways
One tie and two unique places: 12 + 12 + 12 = 36 ways
Two pairs of ties: 6 ways
Three horses tie and one unique place: 4 + 4 = 8 ways
All horses tie: 1 way

Total number of ways = 24 + 36 + 6 + 8 + 1 = 75 ways

Therefore, there are 75 different ways for 4 horses to go through the finish line with the possibility of ties.</code></pre>
