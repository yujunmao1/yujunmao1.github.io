<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Which is the smallest positive integer that becomes 57 times smaller when its first digit is removed?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s denote the number as AB, where A is the first digit and B is the rest of the number. 

The problem can be formulated as follows:

10A + B = 57B

This simplifies to:

10A = 56B

We are looking for the smallest positive integer, so we start with the smallest possible values for A and B. A cannot be 0 (since it&#x27;s the first digit), so we start with A = 1. 

For A = 1, B = 10/56 = 0.17857, which is not an integer. 

We then try A = 2, for which B = 20/56 = 0.35714, still not an integer. 

We continue this process until we find an integer value for B. 

For A = 5, B = 50/56 = 0.89286, still not an integer. 

For A = 6, B = 60/56 = 1.07143, still not an integer. 

For A = 7, B = 70/56 = 1.25, still not an integer. 

For A = 8, B = 80/56 = 1.42857, still not an integer. 

Finally, for A = 9, B = 90/56 = 1.60714, still not an integer. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Let&#x27;s try A = 1 and B = 10. 

10A = 56B

10*1 = 56*10

10 = 560, which is not true. 

We continue this process until we find an integer value for B. 

Finally, for A = 5 and B = 9, we get:

10A = 56B

10*5 = 56*9

50 = 504, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 8 and B = 14, we get:

10A = 56B

10*8 = 56*14

80 = 784, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 9 and B = 16, we get:

10A = 56B

10*9 = 56*16

90 = 896, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 16 and B = 28, we get:

10A = 56B

10*16 = 56*28

160 = 1568, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 28 and B = 49, we get:

10A = 56B

10*28 = 56*49

280 = 2744, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 49 and B = 86, we get:

10A = 56B

10*49 = 56*86

490 = 4816, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 86 and B = 151, we get:

10A = 56B

10*86 = 56*151

860 = 8464, which is not true. 

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 151 and B = 266, we get:

10A = 56B

10*151 = 56*266

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 266 and B = 469, we get:

10A = 56B

10*266 = 56*469

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 1456 and B = 2564, we get:

So, we need to increase the value of A and B. 

Finally, for A = 4516 and B = 7963, we get:

10A = 56B

10*4516 = 56*7963

10*7963 = 56*14028
