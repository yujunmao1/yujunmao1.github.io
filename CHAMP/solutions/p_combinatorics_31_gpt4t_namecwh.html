<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: combination formula.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The combination formula is a fundamental concept in combinatorics, a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. It is used to calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of items from a larger set, without considering the order in which they are chosen. This is often referred to as &quot;n choose k&quot; and is denoted by C(n, k), where n is the total number of items to choose from, and k is the number of items to be chosen.

The combination formula is given by:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

where &quot;!&quot; denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number. For example, 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120.

Let&#x27;s break down the formula:

- n! is the factorial of the total number of items, which represents the number of ways to arrange all n items in a sequence.
- k! is the factorial of the number of items chosen, which accounts for the fact that the order of selection within the chosen subset does not matter.
- (n - k)! is the factorial of the difference between the total number of items and the number of items chosen, which represents the number of ways to arrange the remaining items that were not chosen.

By dividing n! by the product of k! and (n - k)!, we effectively count each subset of size k exactly once, regardless of the order in which its elements are listed.

For example, if you have a set of 5 items (n = 5) and you want to know how many ways you can choose 2 items (k = 2) from this set, you would calculate it as follows:

C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * (5 - 2)!) = (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1) / ((2 × 1) * (3 × 2 × 1)) = 120 / (2 * 6) = 120 / 12 = 10.

So there are 10 different ways to choose 2 items from a set of 5.

The combination formula is widely used in probability theory, statistics, and various fields where the concept of selecting subsets is relevant. It is also closely related to the binomial theorem, which describes the algebraic expansion of powers of a binomial expression.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white, and count the number of white dots in between the black dots, as well as on the two sides.
2. The number of ways to choose a set of (unordered) k items from n items is C(n, k).
3. C(n, k)=C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of combinations with repetition, also known as stars and bars or balls and bins. The problem is equivalent to distributing 3 indistinguishable cookies to 8 distinguishable dogs, where each dog can receive 0, 1, 2, or all 3 cookies.

We can visualize this as placing 3 white dots (cookies) in a row and separating them with black dots (dogs) to indicate which cookies go to which dog. Since we have 8 dogs, we need 7 separators (black dots) to create 8 distinct sections (one for each dog). The arrangement of these dots will represent the distribution of cookies to the dogs.

For example, an arrangement like this:

●●●●●●●○○○

would mean that the first dog gets all 3 cookies, and the rest get none.

An arrangement like this:

●●●●○●●●○●○

would mean that the first four dogs get none, the fifth dog gets one, the next two dogs get none, the eighth dog gets one, and the last dog gets one.

The total number of dots is 3 white + 7 black = 10 dots. We need to choose the positions of the 3 white dots (cookies) among these 10 dots. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula C(n, k), where n is the total number of positions (10 in this case) and k is the number of white dots (3 in this case).

Using the combination formula:

C(n, k) = C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10 - 3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 × 9 × 8) / (3 × 2 × 1) = 120

So there are 120 possible results for distributing 3 indistinguishable cookies to 8 distinguishable dogs, with no cookies left unclaimed and no sharing between dogs.</code></pre>
