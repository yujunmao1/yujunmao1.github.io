Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1*p_2*...*p_n ways to do the task.
5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s follow the steps provided:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By adding the (n+1)-th lot, we create a circular arrangement of the parking lots.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

For every driver i, their favorite parking lot a_i should be free. If it is not free, they should be able to continue to the next free lot until they find one. If all succeeding lots are occupied, they should leave for good.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid sequences as V(n).

4. If there are n steps of doing a task, and there are p_i ways to do the i-th step, then there are p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_n ways to do the task.

In this case, we can consider each step as assigning a parking lot to a driver. For the first driver, there are n+1 options (n parking lots + the circular lot). For the second driver, there are n options (n-1 parking lots + the circular lot, excluding the lot already assigned to the first driver). Similarly, for the third driver, there are n-1 options, and so on.

Therefore, the total number of valid sequences is V(n) = (n+1) * n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1.

5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Since the circular arrangement allows for cyclic shifts, we need to consider all possible cyclic shifts of each sequence. For example, if the sequence is {1, 2, 3}, the cyclic shifts would be {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 1}, and {3, 1, 2}.

To determine the number of valid parking configurations for each sequence, we can start with the first driver&#x27;s assigned lot and check if each subsequent driver can park in their favorite lot or continue to the next free lot. If all drivers can park, the sequence is valid.

By considering all cyclic shifts, we can count the number of valid parking configurations for each sequence.

Therefore, the final answer is the sum of the number of valid parking configurations for each sequence.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid parking configurations for a sequence {a} as C({a}).

The total number of valid sequences is then given by V(n) = C({a_1, ..., a_n}) + C({a_n, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}}) + ... + C({a_2, a_3, ..., a_n, a_1}).

To find the expression for C({a}), we need to analyze the conditions for each driver to park in their favorite lot or continue to the next free lot.

Let&#x27;s denote the number of valid parking configurations for a sequence of length k as C(k).

For the first driver, there are k+1 options (k parking lots + the circular lot).

For the second driver, there are k options (k-1 parking lots + the circular lot, excluding the lot already assigned to the first driver).

Similarly, for the third driver, there are k-1 options, and so on.

Therefore, C(k) = (k+1) * k * (k-1) * ... * 2 * 1.

Now, we can substitute C(k) into the expression for V(n):

V(n) = C(n) + C(n-1) + ... + C(2) + C(1)

V(n) = (n+1) * n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1 + n * (n-1) * ... * 2 * 1 + ... + 2 * 1 + 1

V(n) = (n+1)! + n! + ... + 2! + 1!

Therefore, the final answer is V(n) = (n+1)! + n! + ... + 2! + 1.

This expression represents the number of valid sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that every driver can park, as an expression of n.</code></pre>
