<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let {x_n}, {y_n}, {z_n} be three sequences with positive initial terms x_1, y_1, z_1, defined as x_(n+1)=y_n+1/z_n, y_(n+1)=z_n+1/x_n, z_(n+1)=x_n+1/y_n. At most how many of the three sequences can be bounded?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To analyze the boundedness of the sequences {x_n}, {y_n}, and {z_n}, we can look at the behavior of the sequences over time. We will use the fact that if one of the sequences becomes unbounded, it will affect the other sequences due to their interdependent definitions.

Let&#x27;s assume that one of the sequences is bounded. Without loss of generality, let&#x27;s assume that {x_n} is bounded. This means there exists some constant M such that x_n â‰¤ M for all n.

Given that x_(n+1) = y_n + 1/z_n, if {x_n} is bounded, then {y_n} must also be bounded, because if {y_n} were unbounded, then x_(n+1) would eventually exceed M, contradicting our assumption that {x_n} is bounded. Similarly, since y_(n+1) = z_n + 1/x_n, if {y_n} is bounded, then {z_n} must also be bounded, because if {z_n} were unbounded, then y_(n+1) would eventually exceed the bound of {y_n}.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the sequence {z_n}. Since z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n, if {z_n} is bounded, then {x_n} must be bounded as well, because if {x_n} were unbounded, then z_(n+1) would eventually exceed the bound of {z_n}.

From this, we can see that if any one of the sequences is bounded, then all three sequences must be bounded. This is because the boundedness of one sequence implies the boundedness of the next, and since the sequences are cyclically dependent, the boundedness of one sequence implies the boundedness of all three.

However, we need to consider the possibility that all three sequences could be unbounded. If one sequence starts to grow without bound, it will cause the next sequence to grow as well, and this growth will propagate through the cycle. If this happens, none of the sequences will be bounded.

To determine if this is possible, let&#x27;s assume that all sequences are unbounded. If {x_n} is unbounded, then there exists some n such that x_n is very large. This would make z_(n+1) very large since z_(n+1) = x_n + 1/y_n. A large z_(n+1) would then make y_(n+2) very large, since y_(n+2) = z_(n+1) + 1/x_(n+1). This growth would continue to propagate, making all sequences unbounded.

Therefore, we have two possibilities:
1. All three sequences are bounded.
2. All three sequences are unbounded.

Since the problem asks for the maximum number of sequences that can be bounded, the answer is that at most, all three sequences can be bounded.</code></pre>
