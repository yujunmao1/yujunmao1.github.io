<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please explain the following concept: rule of product.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The rule of product, also known as the multiplication principle or the counting principle, is a fundamental concept in combinatorics that allows us to determine the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.

In simple terms, the rule of product states that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another thing, then there are m * n ways to do both things together.

To understand this concept better, let&#x27;s consider a simple example. Suppose you have 3 different shirts (A, B, C) and 2 different pants (X, Y). If you want to determine the number of possible outfits you can create by choosing one shirt and one pair of pants, you can use the rule of product.

According to the rule of product, you multiply the number of choices for each independent event. In this case, you have 3 choices for the shirt and 2 choices for the pants. Therefore, the total number of possible outfits is 3 * 2 = 6.

To generalize the rule of product, if you have k independent events or choices, each with a different number of options (m1, m2, m3, ..., mk), then the total number of possible outcomes is the product of all the options: m1 * m2 * m3 * ... * mk.

It&#x27;s important to note that the rule of product assumes that the choices or events are independent, meaning that the outcome of one event does not affect the outcome of another event. If the events are dependent, then the rule of product may not be applicable, and other combinatorial principles like the rule of sum or conditional probability may need to be used.

Overall, the rule of product is a powerful tool in combinatorics that allows us to calculate the total number of outcomes or possibilities when multiple independent events or choices are involved.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the concept of recursion and build up the solution step by step.

1. Base case: P(2)
For a 2x2 chessboard, there are only two possible placements for the rooks, as shown below:

R .    . R
. R    R .

Therefore, P(2) = 2.

2. Recursive step: P(2k)
Now, let&#x27;s consider a 2k x 2k chessboard. We can divide it into four quadrants, each of size k x k. We will place the rooks in such a way that the placement is invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

To determine the placement, we can start with the first row and place a rook in one of the 2k positions. According to the given information, if a rook is placed on the first row, another position is also determined.

Let&#x27;s consider the cases for the first row placement:

a) If the rook is placed in an even column (column 2, 4, 6, ..., 2k), then the rook in the corresponding odd column (column 1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1) is also determined. This reduces the problem to a (2k-2) x (2k-2) chessboard.

b) If the rook is placed in an odd column (column 1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1), then the rook in the corresponding even column (column 2, 4, 6, ..., 2k) is also determined. This reduces the problem to a (2k-2) x (2k-2) chessboard.

Therefore, we can express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2) as follows:

P(2k) = 2 * P(2k-2)

3. Recursive calculation:
Using the recursive formula, we can calculate P(2), P(4), P(6), and so on, until we reach the desired value of P(n).

P(2) = 2 (from the base case)

P(4) = 2 * P(2) = 2 * 2 = 4

P(6) = 2 * P(4) = 2 * 4 = 8

P(8) = 2 * P(6) = 2 * 8 = 16

Continuing this pattern, we can calculate P(n) for any given value of n.

4. Final answer:
To find the number of ways n rooks can be placed peacefully on an n x n chessboard, we need to calculate P(n).

If n is odd, we know that one rook must be placed in the center position of the chessboard. Therefore, the number of ways to place the remaining (n-1) rooks peacefully is P(n-1).

If n is even, we can use the recursive formula P(2k) = 2 * P(2k-2) to calculate P(n).

For example, let&#x27;s calculate P(8):

P(8) = 2 * P(6) = 2 * 8 = 16

Therefore, the number of ways 8 rooks can be placed peacefully on an 8 x 8 chessboard, invariant to a 180-degree rotation, is 16.

In general, the number of ways n rooks can be placed peacefully on an n x n chessboard, invariant to a 180-degree rotation, is P(n).</code></pre>
