<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Here is an example that applies the following concept:

If there are n actions, with p_i ways to perform the i-th action, and no two actions can be performed at the same time, then there are p_1+p_2+...+p_n ways to perform the action in total.

Suppose you have a set of n cards, and you want to choose 3 cards from the set. There are nC3 ways to do this, which is equal to n!/(3!(n-3)!). This is because there are n choices for the first card, n-1 choices for the second card, and n-2 choices for the third card. However, we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. For example, if we choose the cards 1, 2, and 3, we are also counting the arrangement 3, 2, 1.

Now, suppose you want to choose 3 cards from the set, but you can only choose one card of each color. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 3! because we are counting each arrangement of the 3 cards 3 times. So, there are nC3/3! ways to choose 3 cards from a set of n cards, with no two cards of the same color.

Another example is if you have a set of n tasks, and you want to choose 3 tasks to do. There are nC3 ways to do this, but we need to divide by 2! because we are counting each order of the 3 tasks 2 times. For example, if we choose the tasks A, B, and C, we are also counting the order B, A, C. So, there are nC3/2! ways to choose 3 tasks from a set of n tasks.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

How many strings of length 6 and consisting solely of the digits 1, 2 and 3 have the property that any two adjacent digits differ by at most 1.

Besides the concept above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let a_n, b_n and c_n be the numbers of length-n strings that end with 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
2. Express a_(n+1), b_(n+1) and c_(n+1) in terms of a_n, b_n and c_n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let $a_n$, $b_n$, and $c_n$ be the number of length-$n$ strings that end in 1, 2, and 3, respectively. We can express $a_{n+1}$, $b_{n+1}$, and $c_{n+1}$ in terms of $a_n$, $b_n$, and $c_n$ as follows:

$$a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n + c_n$$
$$b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n + 3c_n$$
$$c_{n+1} = a_n + 3b_n + 6c_n$$

To see why this is true, consider the following table:

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |

The first row of the table shows the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 1. The second row shows the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 2. The third row shows the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 3.

To get the number of strings of length $n+1$ that end in 1, we can add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 1 to the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 2, and then add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 3. This is because any string of length $n+1$ that ends in 1 must either be a string of length $n$ that ends in 1, followed by a 1, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 2, followed by a 0, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 3, followed by a 2.

Similarly, to get the number of strings of length $n+1$ that end in 2, we can add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 1, followed by a 2, to the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 2, followed by a 2, and then add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 3, followed by a 2. This is because any string of length $n+1$ that ends in 2 must either be a string of length $n$ that ends in 1, followed by a 2, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 2, followed by a 2, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 3, followed by a 2.

Finally, to get the number of strings of length $n+1$ that end in 3, we can add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 1, followed by a 3, to the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 2, followed by a 3, and then add the number of strings of length $n$ that end in 3, followed by a 3. This is because any string of length $n+1$ that ends in 3 must either be a string of length $n$ that ends in 1, followed by a 3, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 2, followed by a 3, or a string of length $n$ that ends in 3, followed by a 3.

Solving the system of equations $a_{n+1} = a_n + b_n + c_n$, $b_{n+1} = a_n + 2b_n + 3c_n$, and $c_{n+1} = a_n + 3b_n + 6c_n$, we get

$$a_n = \frac{1}{6}(3^n - 1)$$
$$b_n = \frac{1}{6}(3^n - 2)$$
$$c_n = \frac{1}{6}(3^n - 3)$$

Therefore, the number of strings of length 6 that end in 1, 2, and 3, respectively, is

$$a_6 = \frac{1}{6}(3^6 - 1) = 1296$$
$$b_6 = \frac{1}{6}(3^6 - 2) = 924$$
$$c</code></pre>
