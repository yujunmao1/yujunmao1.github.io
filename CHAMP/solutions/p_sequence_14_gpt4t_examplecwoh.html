<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The formula you&#x27;ve provided is a recursive relationship for binomial coefficients, which are often denoted as C(n, k), read as &quot;n choose k,&quot; or alternatively written as \( \binom{n}{k} \). This formula expresses the fact that each binomial coefficient can be calculated based on the previous one in a recursive manner.

The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \) represents the number of ways to choose a subset of k elements from a larger set of n distinct elements without regard to the order of selection.

The recursive formula you&#x27;ve provided seems to have a slight mistake. The correct relationship is:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n}{k} \cdot \binom{n-1}{k-1} \]

This formula can be derived from the definition of the binomial coefficient:

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

Now, let&#x27;s apply the correct formula to an example. Suppose we want to calculate \( \binom{5}{3} \) using the recursive relationship.

First, we start with a known base case, such as \( \binom{4}{2} \), which can be calculated directly:

\[ \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2 \cdot 1} = 6 \]

Now, we can use the recursive formula to find \( \binom{5}{3} \):

\[ \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \cdot 6 \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 5 \cdot 2 \]

\[ \binom{5}{3} = 10 \]

So, there are 10 ways to choose a subset of 3 elements from a set of 5 distinct elements.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

C(n, k)=C(n, n-k).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The concept you&#x27;re referring to is the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which states that choosing \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements is equivalent to choosing the \( n - k \) elements that you&#x27;re not choosing. In other words, when you choose \( k \) elements, you&#x27;re simultaneously choosing the \( n - k \) elements to be left out. This property is expressed mathematically as:

\[ C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \]

or, using binomial coefficient notation,

\[ \binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n - k} \]

Let&#x27;s apply this concept with an example. Suppose we have a set of 5 elements, and we want to choose 2 of them. According to the symmetry property, this should be equivalent to choosing 3 elements to leave out (since 5 - 2 = 3). Let&#x27;s calculate both sides of the equation to verify this.

First, we calculate \( C(5, 2) \):

\[ C(5, 2) = \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5 - 2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \]

Now, we calculate \( C(5, 3) \):

\[ C(5, 3) = \binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{3 \times 2} = 10 \]

As expected, \( C(5, 2) \) and \( C(5, 3) \) are equal, both giving us 10. This demonstrates that there are 10 ways to choose 2 elements from a set of 5, which is the same as the number of ways to choose 3 elements to leave out from the same set.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

A sequence that is monotonic and bounded has a limit. Specifically, a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded from above, or monotonically decreasing and bounded from below, has a limit.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Let&#x27;s consider a sequence that is monotonically increasing and bounded above to illustrate this concept. A classic example of such a sequence is the sequence of the sums of the reciprocals of the powers of 2, defined as follows:

\[ a_n = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2^k} \]

So the first few terms of the sequence are:

\[ a_1 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ a_2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \]
\[ a_3 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8} \]
\[ a_4 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{15}{16} \]
\[ \vdots \]

This sequence is monotonically increasing because each term is greater than the one before it. To see this, notice that for each \( n \), \( a_{n+1} = a_n + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \), and since \( \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} &gt; 0 \), it follows that \( a_{n+1} &gt; a_n \).

The sequence is also bounded above by 1. This is because the sum is a geometric series where each term is half the previous term, and the sum of an infinite geometric series with a ratio less than 1 is finite. Specifically, the sum of this series is:

\[ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^k} = 1 \]

This can be seen by considering the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series:

\[ S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \]

where \( a \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. In this case, \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \), so:

\[ S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1 \]

Therefore, the sequence \( (a_n) \) is bounded above by 1.

According to the Monotone Convergence Theorem, because the sequence \( (a_n) \) is monotonically increasing and bounded above, it must have a limit. In this case, the limit is the sum of the infinite series, which is 1. Thus, we can say:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 1 \]</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Let the sequence be defined as a_n=1/C(n, 0)+1/C(n, 1)+...+1/C(n, n). Does the limit of the sequence exist, and if so, what is it?

You may find the above concepts helpful.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we need to analyze the sequence \( a_n \) given by:

\[ a_n = \frac{1}{C(n, 0)} + \frac{1}{C(n, 1)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{C(n, n)} \]

First, let&#x27;s recall that the binomial coefficient \( C(n, k) \) is defined as:

\[ C(n, k) = \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!} \]

Now, let&#x27;s consider the terms of the sequence \( a_n \). For \( k = 0 \) and \( k = n \), the binomial coefficients are:

\[ C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1 \]

This is because choosing 0 or all \( n \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements can be done in exactly one way. Therefore, the first and last terms of \( a_n \) are both 1:

\[ \frac{1}{C(n, 0)} = \frac{1}{C(n, n)} = 1 \]

For the remaining terms, we can use the symmetry property of binomial coefficients, which states that:

\[ C(n, k) = C(n, n - k) \]

This means that each term in the sequence from \( k = 1 \) to \( k = n - 1 \) has a corresponding term that is its reciprocal, and they will cancel each other out when summed. To see this, consider the term \( \frac{1}{C(n, k)} \) and its symmetric counterpart \( \frac{1}{C(n, n - k)} \):

\[ \frac{1}{C(n, k)} + \frac{1}{C(n, n - k)} = \frac{1}{C(n, k)} + \frac{1}{C(n, k)} = \frac{2}{C(n, k)} \]

Since \( C(n, k) \) is the same for both \( k \) and \( n - k \), the sum of these two terms is simply \( \frac{2}{C(n, k)} \).

Now, let&#x27;s write out the full expression for \( a_n \) considering the symmetry:

\[ a_n = 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{2}{C(n, k)} + 1 \]

\[ a_n = 2 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{2}{C(n, k)} \]

Since \( C(n, k) \) grows rapidly as \( k \) gets closer to \( n/2 \), the terms in the sum become very small as \( n \) increases. The dominant terms in the sequence \( a_n \) are the two 1&#x27;s at the beginning and end, which add up to 2.

As \( n \) goes to infinity, the sum of the reciprocals of the binomial coefficients between \( k = 1 \) and \( k = n - 1 \) becomes negligible compared to the constant 2. Therefore, the limit of the sequence \( a_n \) as \( n \) approaches infinity is 2:

\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 2 \]

This is the final answer. The limit of the sequence exists, and it is 2.</code></pre>
