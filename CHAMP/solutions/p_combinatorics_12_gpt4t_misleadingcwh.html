<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. C(n, k)=n/k*C(n-1, k-1).
5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>This problem is a combinatorial problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let&#x27;s follow the steps provided:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By converting the linear parking lot into a circular one, we can consider the problem as if the cars are parking on a circular street with n+1 parking lots. This simplifies the problem because we can now consider sequences where the cars can park in any of the n+1 lots, but we must ensure that not all n+1 lots are used, as this would correspond to a situation where a car cannot park on the original street.

2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

The condition is that in the circular lot, at least one lot must remain empty. This ensures that on the original street, every car can find a parking spot.

3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

There are (n+1)^n total sequences where each of the n drivers can choose from n+1 lots. However, we need to subtract the sequences where all n+1 lots are used, as these do not satisfy the condition.

4. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the valid sequences.

We need to count the number of sequences where at least one lot is empty. We can do this by subtracting from the total number of sequences the number of sequences where each particular lot is filled, and then adding back the sequences where two particular lots are filled (since we subtracted them twice), and so on.

The number of ways to fill exactly k lots out of n+1 is C(n+1, k) (the number of ways to choose k lots) times k^n (the number of ways to assign cars to these k lots, since each car has k choices). By the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of valid sequences is:

Total sequences - sequences with 1 lot filled + sequences with 2 lots filled - ... + (-1)^(n+1) sequences with n+1 lots filled.

This gives us the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \cdot C(n+1, k) \cdot k^n
\]

5. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

Each sequence of preferences can be shifted n times (including the original sequence), and each shift corresponds to a unique sequence. However, all these shifts represent the same parking configuration on the circular lot. Therefore, we have overcounted by a factor of n.

To correct for this overcounting, we divide our previous sum by n:

\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \cdot C(n+1, k) \cdot k^n
\]

This is the number of sequences such that every driver can park, as an expression of n.</code></pre>
