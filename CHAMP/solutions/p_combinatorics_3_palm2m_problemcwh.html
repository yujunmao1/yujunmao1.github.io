<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problem and its solution as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: Find a closed-form formula of sum_(k=1)^n C(n, k)*k^2.
Step-wise solution:
1. For n people, C(n, k) corresponds to the number of possible ways to choose k people, and k^2 correponds to the number of ways to assign two roles, one per person, with one person holding two roles allowed.
2. Thus, we can consider the full expression as the number of ways to choose a committee of any number of people from n people, while at the same time selecting a president and a secretary (who can be the same person) from the chosen committee.
3. If the president and the secretary are the same person, we can first choose this person, with n possibilties, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-1 people, with 2^(n-1) possibilities.
4. If the president and the secretary are different people, we can first choose those two, with n(n-1) possibilities, and then choose the rest of the committee as the subset of the remaining n-2 people, with 2^(n-2) possibilities.
5. Thus, the total number of choices is n*2^(n-1)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=2n*2^(n-2)+n(n-1)*2^(n-2)=n(n+1)*2^(n-2).

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

On a chess board, two rooks are placed peacefully if they are not on the same row or column. For an n x n chess board, find the number of ways that n rooks can be placed peacefully (i.e., any two are placed peacefully) and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. If n is odd, what position must be occupied by a rook?
2. For even n=2k, consider a board of size 2k x 2k. If a rook is placed on the first row, which other position is also determined?
3. Let P(2k) be the number of placements on a 2k x 2k board. Express P(2k) in terms of P(2k-2).
4. Find P(2) as the base case.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation is given by the following formula:

$$P(n) = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } n = 1 \\\
2 &amp; \text{if } n = 2 \\\
P(n-2) + P(n-1) &amp; \text{if } n \ge 3
\end{cases}$$

To prove this formula, we can use a recursive argument. The base case is $n=1$, in which case there is only one way to place a rook on the board. For $n=2$, there are two ways to place two rooks on the board: either they can be placed in the same row or in different rows.

For $n \ge 3$, let $P(n)$ be the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation. We can count the number of placements in two ways. First, we can count the number of placements in which the first rook is placed in the first row. In this case, the second rook must be placed in one of the $n-1$ remaining rows, and the remaining $n-2$ rooks can be placed in any of the $n-2$ columns. This gives a total of $(n-1)(n-2)$ placements.

Second, we can count the number of placements in which the first rook is placed in any of the remaining $n-1$ rows. In this case, the second rook must be placed in the first row, and the remaining $n-2$ rooks can be placed in any of the $n-2$ columns. This gives a total of $(n-1)(n-2)$ placements.

Therefore, the total number of placements is $P(n) = (n-1)(n-2) + (n-1)(n-2) = 2(n-1)(n-2)$.

We can also prove this formula by considering the following diagram:

[Diagram of a chess board with $n$ rooks placed on it]

The rooks in the diagram are placed in such a way that they are not on the same row or column, and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation. We can see that the rooks in the diagram can be divided into two groups: the rooks in the first row and the rooks in the remaining $n-1$ rows. The rooks in the first row can be placed in any of the $n$ columns, and the rooks in the remaining $n-1$ rows can be placed in any of the $n-1$ columns. This gives a total of $n(n-1)$ placements.

However, we have overcounted the number of placements, since we have counted each placement twice: once when the rooks are placed in the order shown in the diagram, and once when they are placed in the reverse order. Therefore, the number of placements is $P(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

We can also prove this formula by considering the following diagram:

[Diagram of a chess board with $n$ rooks placed on it, with the rooks in the first row highlighted]

The rooks in the diagram are placed in such a way that they are not on the same row or column, and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation. We can see that the rooks in the diagram can be divided into two groups: the rooks in the first row and the rooks in the remaining $n-1$ rows. The rooks in the first row can be placed in any of the $n$ columns, and the rooks in the remaining $n-1$ rows can be placed in any of the $n-1$ columns. This gives a total of $n(n-1)$ placements.

However, we have overcounted the number of placements, since we have counted each placement twice: once when the rooks are placed in the order shown in the diagram, and once when they are placed in the reverse order. Therefore, the number of placements is $P(n) = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.

Therefore, the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\times n$ chess board peacefully and invariant to a 180-degree rotation is given by the following formula:
