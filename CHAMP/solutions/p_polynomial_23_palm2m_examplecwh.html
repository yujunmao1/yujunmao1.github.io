<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

a+a*r+a*r^2+...+a*r^n=a(1-r^(n+1))/(1-r), a+a*r+a*r^2+...=a/(1-r).</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say you have a savings account with a balance of $100. You decide to invest the money in a savings account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. After one year, you will have $105 in your account. After two years, you will have $110.25 in your account. And so on.

The formula for calculating compound interest is $A = P(1 + r)^n$, where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the principal amount, $r$ is the interest rate, and $n$ is the number of years.

In this example, $P = 100$, $r = 0.05$, and $n = 1$. So, the final amount after one year is $A = 100(1 + 0.05)^1 = 105$.

After two years, the final amount is $A = 100(1 + 0.05)^2 = 110.25$.

And so on.

You can see that the amount of money in your account is increasing at an exponential rate. This is because the interest you earn is also earning interest.

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is $S_n = \frac{a_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term, $r$ is the common ratio, and $n$ is the number of terms.

In this example, $a_1 = 100$, $r = 0.05$, and $n = 2$. So, the sum of the first two terms is $S_2 = \frac{100(1 - 0.05^2)}{1 - 0.05} = 105.0625$.

The sum of the first three terms is $S_3 = \frac{100(1 - 0.05^3)}{1 - 0.05} = 110.2500625$.

And so on.

You can see that the sum of the terms is getting closer and closer to the final amount. This is because the terms are getting smaller and smaller.

The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is $S = \frac{a_1}{1-r}$, where $a_1$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.

In this example, $a_1 = 100$ and $r = 0.05$. So, the sum of the infinite geometric series is $S = \frac{100}{1 - 0.05} = 1000$.

This means that if you keep investing your money in this savings account for an infinite amount of time, you will eventually have $1000 in your account.

Of course, this is just a theoretical example. In reality, you would have to pay taxes on the interest you earn, and the value of your money would be eroded by inflation. But it still gives you a good idea of how compound interest can work to your advantage.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Please give an example that applies the following concept:

For integer n, the polynomial x-y divides the polynomial x^n-y^n.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say we have the polynomials $x^2 - y^2$ and $x^3 - y^3$. We can factor out $x-y$ from both polynomials to get:

$$x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y)$$
$$x^3 - y^3 = (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)$$

This is an example of the Factor Theorem, which states that if $f(x)$ is a polynomial and $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $a$ is a root of $f(x)$. In this case, $x-y$ is a factor of both $x^2 - y^2$ and $x^3 - y^3$, so $y$ is a root of both polynomials.

We can also see this visually by graphing the polynomials. The graph of $x^2 - y^2$ is a parabola that passes through the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,-1)$. The graph of $x^3 - y^3$ is a cubic that passes through the points $(0,0)$, $(1,-1)$, and $(-1,1)$. You can see that the two graphs intersect at the point $(1,-1)$. This means that $y=1$ is a root of both polynomials.

In general, for any integer $n$, the polynomial $x^n - y^n$ can be factored as $(x-y)(x^{n-1} + x^{n-2}y + ... + xy^{n-2} + y^{n-1})$. This is because the polynomial $x^n - y^n$ has $n$ roots, which are all the values of $y$ that satisfy the equation $x^n - y^n = 0$. We can factor out $x-y$ from the polynomial and then group the remaining terms together to get the desired factorization.</code></pre>

If d | a and d | b, then d | ax+by, d | a + b and d | a-b.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say $d$ is a positive integer and $a$ and $b$ are integers. If $d$ divides $a$ and $d$ divides $b$, then $d$ divides $ax+by$. This is because $ax+by$ can be written as $a(x/d)+b(y/d)$, and $d$ divides both $a(x/d)$ and $b(y/d)$.

For example, if $d=3$, $a=2$, and $b=1$, then $ax+by=2(3)+1(3)=9$. Since $3$ divides $2$ and $3$ divides $1$, $3$ divides $9$.

We can also see this visually by graphing the numbers $a$, $b$, and $ax+by$. The graph of $a$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,a)$ and $(1,a)$. The graph of $b$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,b)$ and $(1,b)$. The graph of $ax+by$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,a+b)$ and $(1,a+b)$. You can see that the three lines intersect at the point $(0,0)$. This means that $d$ divides $ax+by$.

In general, if $d$ divides $a$ and $d$ divides $b$, then $d$ divides $ax+by$ for any integers $x$ and $y$. This is because $ax+by$ can be written as $a(x/d)+b(y/d)$, and $d$ divides both $a(x/d)$ and $b(y/d)$.</code></pre>

<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers. If $a$ divides $b$ and $b$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $c$. This is because $c$ can be written as $b(c/b)$, and $a$ divides $b$.

For example, if $a=2$, $b=3$, and $c=6$, then $c=3(c/3)=2(3(c/3))=2(c)$. Since $2$ divides $3$ and $3$ divides $6$, $2$ divides $6$.

We can also see this visually by graphing the numbers $a$, $b$, and $c$. The graph of $a$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,a)$ and $(1,a)$. The graph of $b$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,b)$ and $(1,b)$. The graph of $c$ is a line that passes through the points $(0,c)$ and $(1,c)$.

Finding the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x), where p(x)=x^6+x^5+...+x+1?

Besides the concepts above, you may also find the following information useful:

1. Let y=x^7 and study the divisibility of p(y)-p(1) by y-1.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>Sure. Let&#x27;s say $p(x) = x^6 + x^5 + ... + x + 1$. We can write $p(x)$ as follows:

$$p(x) = \sum_{k=0}^6 x^k = \frac{x^7 - 1}{x-1} + 1$$

We can then substitute $y = x^7$ to get:

$$p(y) = \frac{y^7 - 1}{y-1} + 1$$

We can factor the numerator of the expression in the numerator as follows:

$$y^7 - 1 = (y-1)(y^6 + y^5 + ... + y + 1)$$

Substituting this back into the expression for $p(y)$, we get:

$$p(y) = \frac{(y-1)(y^6 + y^5 + ... + y + 1)}{y-1} + 1$$

We can then cancel the $y-1$ terms to get:

$$p(y) = y^6 + y^5 + ... + y + 1$$

This means that $p(y)$ is a polynomial of degree 6. We can then use the Factor Theorem to find the remainder when $p(x^7)$ is divided by $p(x)$. The Factor Theorem states that if $f(x)$ is a polynomial and $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $a$ is a root of $f(x)$. In this case, $x-1$ is a factor of $p(x)$, so $1$ is a root of $p(x)$. This means that the remainder when $p(x^7)$ is divided by $p(x)$ is $1$.

In other words, we can write:

$$p(x^7) = q(x)p(x) + 1$$

for some polynomial $q(x)$. We can then find $q(x)$ by substituting $x=1$ into the equation above. This gives us:

$$p(1^7) = q(1)p(1) + 1$$

$$1 = q(1) + 1$$

$$q(1) = 0$$

Therefore, the remainder when $p(x^7)$ is divided by $p(x)$ is $1$.</code></pre>
