<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>First, study the following problems and their solutions as they may contain helpful information.

Problem: 8 dogs fight over 3 cookies. It is possible that a dog gets more than one cookie or no cookies. However, no two dogs would share the same cookie and there are no cookies left unclaimed. If the cookies are the same but the dogs are different (e.g., dog A, B, C each getting one cookie is one result but dog B, C, D each getting one cookie is a different result), how many possible results are there?
Step-wise solution:
1. Consider possible configurations of a row of 10 dots, with 7 being black and 3 being white.
2. We can derive 8 numbers, being the numbers of white dots to the left of the first black dot, in between each black dots, and to the right of the last black dot.
3. Obviously each number is non-negative and all numbers sum up to 3.
4. Thus, we can consider this as one possible result of the fight.
5. Furthermore, each fight result can also be encoded as a dot configuration.
6. So there are C(10, 7)=C(10, 3)=120 possible results.

Problem: In how many ways can you take an odd number of objects from n (distinct) objects?
Step-wise solution:
1. Let U be the set of objects.
2. For a specific object m in the collection, we can partition the set of all subsets into two sets, A={S⊆U: m∈S} and B={S⊆U: m∉S}.
3. We can construct a one-to-one mapping between A and B by pairing up sets that only differ in m, so |A|=|B|.
4. Thus, one of the sets has an odd number of objects and the other has an even number of objects.
5. Since there are 2^n subsets, there are 2^(n-1) subsets with an odd number of objects.

Problem: A one-to-one mapping p: {1, 2, ..., n}-&gt;{1, 2, ..., n} is called an involution, if p∘p=identity (i.e., p(p(i))=i for all i∈{1, ..., n}). Find the number of involutions on {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
Step-wise solution:
1. Let T(n) be the number of involutions on {1, 2, ..., n}.
2. Thus, we have T(1)=1 for {1-&gt;1}, and T(2)=2 for {1-&gt;1, 2-&gt;2} and {1-&gt;2, 2-&gt;1}.
3. For n&gt;2, on each involution of the set {1, ..., n-1}, we can add {n-&gt;n} to construct a new involution.
4. In addition, we can also pull out an item i from n-1 items to make {n-&gt;i, i-&gt;n}, and add this to any involution of the set consisting of the remaining n-2 items.
5. Thus, we have T(n)=T(n-1)+(n-1)*T(n-2).
6. Starting from T(1)=1, T(2)=2, we have T(3)=4, T(4)=10, T(5)=26 and T(6)=76.

With what you have learned, solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

There are three different toys. We give one toy to each child, selected among four boys and six girls. We want to make sure that at least two boys are selected. In how many ways can this be done?

In addition, you may also find the following information helpful:

1. In how many ways can two boys and one girl be selected?
2. In how many ways can three boys be selected?
3. In how many ways can the three toys be given to the selected children?</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let&#x27;s find the total number of ways to distribute the toys without any restrictions. We have 4 boys and 6 girls, so there are 4 choices for the first toy, 6 choices for the second toy, and 10 choices for the third toy. Therefore, the total number of ways to distribute the toys is 4 * 6 * 10 = 240.

Next, let&#x27;s find the number of ways to distribute the toys where no boys are selected. In this case, we have 6 choices for the first toy (girls only), 5 choices for the second toy (excluding the girl who received the first toy), and 4 choices for the third toy (excluding the two girls who received the first two toys). Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the toys without any boys is 6 * 5 * 4 = 120.

Similarly, let&#x27;s find the number of ways to distribute the toys where only one boy is selected. We have 4 choices for the boy who receives the toy, 6 choices for the girl who receives the second toy, and 5 choices for the girl who receives the third toy (excluding the girl who received the second toy). Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the toys with only one boy is 4 * 6 * 5 = 120.

Now, let&#x27;s find the number of ways to distribute the toys where no boys are selected or only one boy is selected. This can be done by subtracting the number of ways to distribute the toys without any boys from the number of ways to distribute the toys with only one boy: 120 - 120 = 0.

Finally, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of ways to distribute the toys where at least two boys are selected. The total number of ways to distribute the toys is 240, and we need to subtract the number of ways where no boys are selected or only one boy is selected, which is 0. Therefore, the number of ways to distribute the toys with at least two boys is 240 - 0 = 240.

So, there are 240 ways to distribute the toys such that at least two boys are selected.</code></pre>
