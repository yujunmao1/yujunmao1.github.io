<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

Along a one-way street there are n parking lots. One-by-one n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street. Each driver i heads to his favorite parking lot a_i, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} are such that every driver can park, as an expression of n?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.
2. Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.
3. Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of the satisfy the condition?
4. For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted version (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, let&#x27;s follow the steps provided:

Step 1: Convert the street parking lot into a circle by adding an (n+1)-th lot that connects to both the n-th lot and the 1st lot.

By adding the (n+1)-th lot, we create a circular arrangement of the parking lots.

Step 2: Establish the condition on the circular lot equivalent to every car being able to park on the street parking lot.

For every driver to be able to park, we need to ensure that there are no consecutive occupied lots. In other words, we want to avoid situations where two neighboring drivers both choose their favorite lot, resulting in one of them not being able to park.

Step 3: Consider all driver preference sequences of length n but taking values in 1 to n+1. How many of them satisfy the condition?

Let&#x27;s consider the driver preference sequences of length n. Each driver has n+1 choices for their favorite lot (including the (n+1)-th lot). Therefore, there are (n+1)^n possible sequences.

Step 4: For each sequence {a}, consider its n cyclically shifted versions (including itself), and study how many lead to a valid parking configuration.

To analyze the valid parking configurations, we need to consider all possible cyclic shifts of each sequence {a}. By doing so, we can determine if there exists a valid parking configuration for each sequence.

Let&#x27;s illustrate this with an example:

Suppose we have n = 3, and the driver preference sequence is {1, 2, 3}. The possible cyclic shifts are:

{1, 2, 3}
{2, 3, 1}
{3, 1, 2}

For the first sequence {1, 2, 3}, all drivers can park since there are no consecutive occupied lots.

For the second sequence {2, 3, 1}, driver 1 chooses lot 2, driver 2 chooses lot 3, and driver 3 chooses lot 1. Again, all drivers can park.

For the third sequence {3, 1, 2}, driver 1 chooses lot 3, driver 2 chooses lot 1, and driver 3 chooses lot 2. Once again, all drivers can park.

Therefore, all three sequences lead to valid parking configurations.

To generalize this, we can conclude that for any driver preference sequence of length n, all cyclic shifts of the sequence will lead to a valid parking configuration if and only if there are no consecutive occupied lots in the original sequence.

So, the number of valid parking configurations is equal to the number of driver preference sequences of length n that have no consecutive occupied lots.

In other words, we need to count the number of sequences {a_1, ..., a_n} such that a_i ≠ a_(i+1) for all i, where a_(n+1) is considered to be a_1.

To count these sequences, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let&#x27;s denote A_i as the set of sequences where a_i = a_(i+1) for some i.

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of valid parking configurations is given by:

Total number of sequences - |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n|

To calculate |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n|, we need to consider all possible intersections of the sets A_i.

For example, |A_1 ∩ A_2| represents the number of sequences where a_1 = a_2 and a_2 = a_3.

By considering all possible intersections, we can calculate |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n|.

Finally, we subtract |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ ... ∪ A_n| from the total number of sequences to obtain the number of valid parking configurations.

Unfortunately, without knowing the specific value of n, it is not possible to provide a closed-form expression for the number of valid parking configurations. However, the above approach outlines the general method to solve the problem.</code></pre>
