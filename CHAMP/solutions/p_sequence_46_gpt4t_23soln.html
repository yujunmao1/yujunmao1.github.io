<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

In how many ways can 12 geometric progressions be selected from the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 such that every number is in exactly one progression?

Below is a partial solution to the problem that may be helpful:

1. For three different prime numbers, p&lt;q&lt;r, we have r/qâ‰ q/p, because otherwise q^2=pr implies that p=q=r.
2. So no three prime numbers can be in one geometric progression.
3. Since there are 25 prime numbers under 100, we need at least 13 geometric progressions to contain them.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>The partial solution provided has already established that no three prime numbers can be in one geometric progression. This is because if three prime numbers \( p &lt; q &lt; r \) were in a geometric progression, we would have \( r/q = q/p \), which would imply \( q^2 = pr \), contradicting the fact that prime numbers are only divisible by 1 and themselves.

However, the conclusion that at least 13 geometric progressions are needed to contain the 25 prime numbers under 100 is incorrect. This is because we can have geometric progressions that contain both prime and non-prime numbers. For example, a geometric progression could start with a prime number and have a common ratio that is not a prime number, thus including non-prime numbers in the progression.

To solve the problem, we need to consider the constraints:

1. Each number from 1 to 100 must be in exactly one geometric progression.
2. A geometric progression is defined by its first term and common ratio.

Given these constraints, we can start by considering the simplest geometric progressions, which are the ones that consist of a single number. Since each number must be in exactly one progression, the number 1 can only form a geometric progression by itself because any other number multiplied by a ratio would give a number greater than 1.

Next, we can consider the prime numbers. Since no three prime numbers can be in the same geometric progression, each prime number can either start a new progression or be the second term in a progression where the first term is 1 and the common ratio is the prime number itself.

Let&#x27;s consider the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, ..., 97. Each of these can be the starting term of a geometric progression. For example, the progression starting with 2 could be 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64. The progression starting with 3 could be 3, 9, 27, 81. And so on.

However, we need to be careful with prime numbers that, when squared, exceed 100, as they cannot have a second term in the progression that is also under 100. For example, the prime number 11 can only start a progression with itself, as 11^2 = 121, which is greater than 100.

Let&#x27;s count the number of prime numbers less than 100 that, when squared, are still less than 100: 2, 3, 5, 7. These primes can start progressions that have more than one term.

Now, let&#x27;s consider the non-prime numbers. Each non-prime number must either start a new progression or be part of an existing progression. For example, the number 4 must be part of the progression starting with 2. The number 6 must be part of the progression starting with 3, and so on.

The problem becomes complex because we need to account for all possible geometric progressions that can be formed with the given numbers, ensuring that each number is used exactly once.

Given the complexity of the problem and the constraints, it is not straightforward to provide a solution without a more detailed analysis or a computational approach. The problem requires considering all possible combinations of geometric progressions that can be formed with the numbers 1 to 100, which is a combinatorial problem that may not have a simple closed-form solution.

Therefore, the problem as stated cannot be solved with the information provided and the partial solution given. A more detailed analysis or a computational algorithm would be required to find the exact number of ways to select the 12 geometric progressions from the numbers 1 to 100.</code></pre>
