<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #98DF8A !important;'>Solve the following problem. Make sure to show your work before giving the final answer.

For how many values of n in {1, 2, ..., 100} do we have (n+1)^n≥2^n*n!?

You may find the following information useful:

1. Study the validity of the inequality for n if the inequality for n-1 holds.</code></pre>
<pre style="margin-bottom: 15px; margin-top: 15px;"><code class="language-plaintext" style='background-color: #FFBB78 !important;'>To solve this problem, we can start by examining the inequality for small values of n and then look for a pattern or a way to use induction to prove the inequality for larger values of n.

Let&#x27;s start by checking the base case, n = 1:

(n+1)^n ≥ 2^n * n!
(1+1)^1 ≥ 2^1 * 1!
2 ≥ 2 * 1
2 ≥ 2

The inequality holds for n = 1.

Now, let&#x27;s assume the inequality holds for some n = k, where k is an integer greater than 1. That is, we assume:

(k+1)^k ≥ 2^k * k!

We want to show that the inequality also holds for n = k + 1:

(k+2)^(k+1) ≥ 2^(k+1) * (k+1)!

Let&#x27;s expand the left side of the inequality using the assumption that the inequality holds for n = k:

(k+2)^(k+1) = (k+2) * (k+2)^k
             ≥ (k+2) * 2^k * k!   (by the inductive assumption)

Now, we need to compare this with the right side of the inequality for n = k + 1:

2^(k+1) * (k+1)! = 2 * 2^k * (k+1) * k!

To show that (k+2)^(k+1) ≥ 2^(k+1) * (k+1)!, it suffices to show that:

(k+2) * 2^k * k! ≥ 2 * 2^k * (k+1) * k!

Dividing both sides by 2^k * k!, we get:

k+2 ≥ 2 * (k+1)

Simplifying, we have:

k+2 ≥ 2k + 2

Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:

k ≥ 2k

This inequality does not hold for all k. In fact, it only holds for k = 0, which is not in our set {1, 2, ..., 100}. Therefore, our inductive step fails, and we cannot use induction in this straightforward manner.

Instead, let&#x27;s examine the inequality directly for values of n. We want to find for how many values of n the following holds:

(n+1)^n ≥ 2^n * n!

Let&#x27;s test a few more values of n manually:

For n = 2:
(2+1)^2 ≥ 2^2 * 2!
3^2 ≥ 4 * 2
9 ≥ 8
The inequality holds for n = 2.

For n = 3:
(3+1)^3 ≥ 2^3 * 3!
4^3 ≥ 8 * 6
64 ≥ 48
The inequality holds for n = 3.

For n = 4:
(4+1)^4 ≥ 2^4 * 4!
5^4 ≥ 16 * 24
625 ≥ 384
The inequality holds for n = 4.

It seems that the inequality holds for small values of n, but we need a more systematic way to determine for which values of n it holds up to 100.

Notice that (n+1)^n is growing polynomially in n, while 2^n * n! is growing faster due to the factorial term. As n gets larger, the factorial term will eventually dominate, and the inequality will no longer hold.

To find the exact point where the inequality switches from holding to not holding, we would need to compare the growth rates of both sides of the inequality more carefully. This could involve using tools like Stirling&#x27;s approximation for n! or analyzing the ratio of consecutive terms.

However, since this is a discrete problem with a finite set of n values, we can also approach it computationally. We can write a simple program or use a computational tool to check the inequality for each value of n from 1 to 100. This brute force method is not elegant, but it is effective for this problem.

Let&#x27;s do a rough estimation to see when the inequality might start to fail. We can use the fact that n! grows faster than any exponential function. As n increases, the factorial term in the right-hand side of the inequality will eventually outgrow the polynomial term on the left-hand side. This will likely happen for some value of n that is not too large, since the factorial grows very quickly.

To find the exact values of n for which the inequality holds, we would need to check each value of n from 1 to 100, which is a tedious process to do by hand. However, we can use a computer to do this efficiently. If you have access to a computational tool, you can run a simple script to check the inequality for each value of n in the set {1, 2, ..., 100} and count the number of times the inequality holds.

If you would like, I can guide you through writing such a script or provide a more detailed mathematical analysis to estimate the range of n for which the inequality holds.</code></pre>
