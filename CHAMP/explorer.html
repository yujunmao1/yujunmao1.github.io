There are 8 trees in total, so there are 8! (8 factorial) ways to arrange them.

There is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 chess board, and this placement is invariant to a 180-degree rotation. Therefore, $f(1)=1$.\n* Case 2: $n=2$. There are two ways to place two rooks on a 2x2 chess board such that any two rooks are placed peacefully: either both rooks can be placed in the same row or column, or they can be placed in opposite corners. The first placement is not invariant to a 180-degree rotation, but the second placement is. Therefore, $f(2)=1$.\n* Case 3: $n=3$. There are four ways to place three rooks on a 3x3 chess board such that any two rooks are placed peacefully: either all three rooks can be placed in the same row or column, or they can be placed in two rows and the third rook can be placed in the middle of the third row.

For example, if we place the rooks in the first row, second row, and third row, then the placement is not invariant to a 180-degree rotation because the rooks in the first and third rows would be in the same column after the rotation.\n\nTo count the number of placements that are invariant to a 180-degree rotation, we can consider the following. Let $G$ be the group of all symmetries of an $n\\times n$ chess board. This group has $2n^2$ elements, corresponding to all possible rotations and reflections of the board. For each placement of $n$ rooks on the board, we can consider the subgroup $H$ of $G$ that consists of all symmetries that leave the placement invariant. The number of elements in $H$ is equal to the number of ways to place $n$ rooks on an $n\\times n$ chess board such that any two rooks are placed peacefully and the placing is also invariant to a 180-degree rotation.\n\nTo find the number of elements in $H$, we can use the following argument. Let $S_n$ be the group of all permutations of $n$ elements. For each $\\sigma\\in S_n$, let $R_\\sigma$ be the corresponding rotation of the chess board that maps the $i$th row to the $\\sigma(i)$th row. Then, $H$ is the subgroup of $S_n$ generated by the elements $R_\\sigma$ for $\\sigma\\in S_n$.\n\nThe number of elements in $H$ is equal to the order of $H$, which is equal to the index of $H$ in $S_n$. The index of $H$ in $S_n$ is equal to the number of orbits of $S_n$ acting on the set of all placements of $n$ rooks on an $n\\times n$ chess board.\n\nTo find the number of orbits of $S_n$ acting on the set of all placements of $n$ rooks on an $n\\times n$ chess board, we can use the following argument.

Since y is an integer, y^2 mod 3 can either be 0 (if y is a multiple of 3) or 1 (if y is not a multiple of 3). We can write y as y = 3u + a, where a is the remainder when y is divided by 3, so a \u2208 {0, 1, 2}.\n\nNow, let\u0027s study x mod 3. Similarly, x^2 mod 3 can either be 0 (if x is a multiple of 3) or 1 (if x is not a multiple of 3). We can write x as x = 3v + b, where b is the remainder when x is divided by 3, so b \u2208 {0, 1, 2}.\n\nSubstituting y = 3u + a and x = 3v + b into the original equation, we get:\n\n15(3v + b)^2 - 7(3u + a)^2 = 9\n\nExpanding both terms, we have:\n\n15(9v^2 + 6vb + b^2) - 7(9u^2 + 6ua + a^2) = 9\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n135v^2 + 90vb + 15b^2 - 63u^2 - 42ua - 7a^2 = 9\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the resulting equation modulo 3. Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can simplify the equation as follows:\n\n(135v^2 + 90vb + 15b^2 - 63u^2 - 42ua - 7a^2) mod 3 = 9 mod 3\n\nSince 9 mod 3 = 0, we can reduce the equation to:\n\n(0v^2 + 0vb + 0b^2 - 0u^2 - 0ua - 7a^2) mod 3 = 0\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n-7a^2 mod 3 = 0\n\nNow, we know that -7 mod 3 = 2, so we have:\n\n2a^2 mod 3 = 0\n\nSince a^2 mod 3 can only be 0 or 1, the only way for 2a^2 mod 3 to be 0 is if a^2 mod 3 is 0. This means that a must be a multiple of 3, so a = 0.\n\nNow that we know a = 0, we can substitute back into the equation y = 3u + a to get y = 3u.\n\nNext, we need to find the possible values for b. Since we have not used the information about x mod 3 yet, let\u0027s consider the original equation modulo 3 again, but this time focusing on the x term:\n\n15x^2 mod 3 = 9 mod 3\n\nSince 9 mod 3 = 0, we have:\n\n15x^2 mod 3 = 0\n\nThis means that x^2 mod 3 must also be 0, which implies that x must be a multiple of 3.

This is a much simpler equation, but it\u0027s not immediately clear how to find all integer solutions. However, we can try to find some solutions by trial and error or by using more advanced number theory techniques.\n\nOne way to proceed is to notice that this is a hyperbola, and we can look for solutions where v and u are relatively small. By trial and error, we can find that (v, u) = (1, 1) is a solution since 15(1)^2 - 7(1)^2 = 15 - 7 = 8, which is not a solution to our equation. We need to find a pair (v, u) such that 15v^2 - 7u^2 = 1.\n\nThis is a Pell-like equation, and finding all solutions can be quite involved. Generally, one would find a fundamental solution and then generate all other solutions using that fundamental solution. However, this process is beyond the scope of a simple step-by-step explanation.\n\nIn conclusion, we have reduced the original problem to solving the Pell-like equation 15v^2 - 7u^2 = 1 for integers v and u. Finding all solutions to this equation requires more advanced techniques in number theory, and the solutions will give us the values of x and y when multiplied by 3 (since x = 3v and y = 3u)."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "end_idx": 323, "start_idx": 159, "text": "To solve the Diophantine equation \\(15x^2 - 7y^2 = 9\\), we can rearrange the equation to make it look like a difference of two squares:\n\n\\[15x^2 = 7y^2 + 9\\]\n\nNow, let\u0027s try to factor both sides to see if we can simplify the equation.

Let a be a positive integer and p be a prime. Then a^p\u2261a mod p.\n\nThis is Fermat\u0027s Little Theorem.

Since we are looking for integer values of \\( x \\), and we have already found that \\( x = 3 \\) satisfies the conditions, we can conjecture that the only solution is \\( x = 3 \\).\n\nTo prove this, we can use a bit of number theory.

Moreover, since \\( 8x^2 + 1 \\) is of the form \\( 8m + 9 \\), it must be 1 modulo 8 to be prime. However, as \\( x \\) increases, the chances of \\( 8x^2 + 1 \\) being prime decrease rapidly due to the increasing number of potential factors.\n\nTherefore, without a general proof, we can reasonably conjecture that the only integer value of \\( x \\) such that both \\( x \\) and \\( 8x^2 + 1 \\) are prime is \\( x = 3 \\).

In this case, $p^n-1=p-1$, which is divisible by $1$.\n\nNow, assume that the theorem is true for some positive integer $k$. That is, assume that $p^k-1$ is divisible by $k$. We want to show that the theorem is also true for $k+1$. That is, we want to show that $p^{k+1}-1$ is divisible by $k+1$.\n\nWe can write $p^{k+1}-1$ as follows:\n\n$$p^{k+1}-1 = (p^k)^2 - 1^2 = (p^k-1)(p^k+1)$$\n\nSince $p^k-1$ is divisible by $k$, and $p^k+1$ is always even, $p^{k+1}-1$ is divisible by $k+1$.\n\nThis completes the proof of the theorem.\n\nNow, let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ be positive integers such that $ab=cd$. We can write $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$ as follows:\n\n$$a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n = (a^n/b^n)+(b^n/a^n)+(c^n/d^n)+(d^n/c^n)$$\n\nSince $ab=cd$, we can divide both sides of this equation by $ab$ to get:\n\n$$a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n = \\frac{a^n}{b^n}+\\frac{b^n}{a^n}+\\frac{c^n}{d^n}+\\frac{d^n}{c^n}$$\n\nBy the theorem, we know that $a^n-1$ is divisible by $n$, $b^n-1$ is divisible by $n$, $c^n-1$ is divisible by $n$, and $d^n-1$ is divisible by $n$. Therefore, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$ is divisible by $n^2$.\n\nSince $n$ is a positive integer, $n^2$ is also a positive integer. Therefore, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$ is a multiple of a positive integer. This means that $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$ is either a prime number or a composite number.\n\nTo show that $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n$ can be a prime number, we can consider the following example. Let $a=2$, $b=3$, $c=5$, and $d=7$. Then, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=2^n+3^n+5^n+7^n$.\n\nFor $n=1$, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=2+3+5+7=17$, which is a prime number.\n\nFor $n=2$, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=4+9+25+49=87$, which is not a prime number.\n\nFor $n=3$, $a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=8+27+125"}}, "identifier": "P_Number-Theory_61", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "We have @@a/c=d/b=x/y@@ where @@gcd(x, y)=1@@.", "_text": "We have a/c=d/b=x/y where gcd(x, y)=1.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, we have @@a=ux, c=uy, b=vy, d=vx@@.", "_text": "Thus, we have a=ux, c=uy, b=vy, d=vx.", "ch_idxs": [1]}, {"_raw_text": "We have @@a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=u^n*x^n+v^n*y^n+u^n*y^n+v^n*x^n=(u^n+v^n)(x^n+y^n)@@.", "_text": "We have a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n=u^n*x^n+v^n*y^n+u^n*y^n+v^n*x^n=(u^n+v^n)(x^n+y^n).", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "Since each of @@u, v, x, y@@ is at least 1, the above factorization shows that @@a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n@@ is never a prime number.", "_text": "Since each of u, v, x, y is at least 1, the above factorization shows that a^n+b^n+c^n+d^n is never a prime number.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Number-Theory_62": {"_answer": "No such values", "_raw_answer": "No such values", "_raw_text": "Find all prime number values of @@n\u003e2@@ such that @@1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1)@@ is a factor of @@1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1)@@.", "_text": "Find all prime number values of n\u003e2 such that 1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1) is a factor of 1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1).", "category": "Number-Theory", "ch_list": ["C_sum_1_n", "C_div_prime"], "fws_annotations": {"Problem + CH": {"author": "gpt-4", "end_idx": null, "start_idx": null, "text": "The sum of the first (n-1) natural numbers is given by the formula n(n-1)/2.

Let\u0027s find the convergents of this continued fraction:\n\n1 + 1/2 = 3/2\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12\n1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29\n...\n\nThe convergents of the continued fraction [1; 2, 2, 2, ...] are given by the ratios of consecutive numerators and denominators: 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, ...\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the solutions to the equation p^2 - 1 = (sqrt(2)*q)^2. We can see that the solutions will be of the form (p, sqrt(2)*q) = (3, 2), (7, 5), (17, 12), (41, 29), ...\n\nFrom these solutions, we can extract the values of p and q. For example, from (3, 2), we have p = 3 and q = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, from (7, 5), we have p = 7 and q = 5/sqrt(2) = (5*sqrt(2))/2.\n\nNow, we need to check which of these solutions satisfy the condition of being prime numbers. We can see that p = 3 and p = 7 are prime numbers, but p = 17 and p = 41 are not prime.\n\nTherefore, the prime number solutions to the equation p^2 - 2*q^2 = 1 are p = 3 and p = 7.\n\nFinal Answer: p = 3, 7."}}, "identifier": "P_Number-Theory_65", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "For either @@p\u22643@@ or @@q\u22643@@, we have two solutions: @@p=3, q=2@@ and @@p=5, q=3@@.", "_text": "For either p\u22643 or q\u22643, we have two solutions: p=3, q=2 and p=5, q=3.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "For both @@p,q\u003e3@@, we can write @@p=6m\u00b11@@ and @@q=6n\u00b11@@.", "_text": "For both p,q\u003e3, we can write p=6m\u00b11 and q=6n\u00b11.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, @@p^2-2*q^2 mod 6=(6m\u00b11)^2-2(6n\u00b11)^2 mod 6=(36^m\u00b112m+1)-2(36n^2\u00b112n+1) mod 6=-1 mod 6@@.", "_text": "Thus, p^2-2*q^2 mod 6=(6m\u00b11)^2-2(6n\u00b11)^2 mod 6=(36^m\u00b112m+1)-2(36n^2\u00b112n+1) mod 6=-1 mod 6.", "ch_idxs": [1, 2, 3]}, {"_raw_text": "This contradicts with the right hand side of @@1 mod 6@@.", "_text": "This contradicts with the right hand side of 1 mod 6.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, the only two solutions are @@p=3, q=2@@ and @@p=5, q=3@@.", "_text": "Thus, the only two solutions are p=3, q=2 and p=5, q=3.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Number-Theory_66": {"_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_text": "If @@n@@ is a composite number, find all possible values of @@1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1) mod 1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1)@@.", "_text": "If n is a composite number, find all possible values of 1*2*...*(n-2)*(n-1) mod 1+2+...+(n-2)+(n-1).", "category": "Number-Theory", "ch_list": ["H_Number-Theory_66_1", "C_sum_1_n", "H_Number-Theory_66_2", "H_Number-Theory_66_3", "C_euclidean"], "fws_annotations": {"Problem + CH": {"author": "chat-bison-001", "end_idx": 251, "start_idx": 171, "text": "Let $n$ be a composite number.

We can write y = 2m + 1 for some positive integer m. Substituting this into the equation, we have:\n\n2^x + 1 = 3^(2m + 1)\n\nRewriting this equation, we get:\n\n(2^k)^2 + 1 = 3 * (3^m)^2\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the possible remainders when dividing (2^k)^2 + 1 by 3. The remainders can only be 0 or 1, as we discussed earlier.\n\nSince (3^m)^2 \u2261 0 or 1 (mod 3), we must have 1 \u2261 3 * (3^m)^2 (mod 3), which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integer solutions when x is even and y is odd.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the case when x is odd and y is even. We can write y = 2m for some positive integer m. Substituting this into the equation, we have:\n\n2^x + 1 = (3^m)^2\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the possible remainders when dividing 2^x + 1 by 4. The remainders can only be 1 or 3, since 2^x \u2261 0 or 2 (mod 4).\n\nSince (3^m)^2 \u2261 0 or 1 (mod 4), we must have 1 \u2261 (3^m)^2 (mod 4), which implies m is even.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if x is odd and y is even, then m is even.\n\nIn summary, we have shown that if x is even, then y is odd, and if x is odd, then m is even.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the case when x is even and y is odd. We have already shown that this case does not have any positive integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, the only possible case is when x is odd and y is even.\n\nLet\u0027s write x = 2k + 1 and y = 2m, where k and m are positive integers.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation, we have:\n\n2^(2k + 1) + 1 = (3^m)^2\n\nRewriting this equation, we get:\n\n2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 = (3^m)^2\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the possible remainders when dividing 2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 by 4. The remainders can only be 1 or 3, as we discussed earlier.\n\nSince (3^m)^2 \u2261 0 or 1 (mod 4), we must have 1 \u2261 (3^m)^2 (mod 4), which implies m is even.\n\nTherefore, we have shown that if x is odd and y is even, then m is even.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the case when x is odd, y is even, and m is even. We can write m = 2n for some positive integer n. Substituting this into the equation, we have:\n\n2^(2k + 1) + 1 = (3^(2n))^2\n\nRewriting this equation, we get:\n\n2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 = (3^2n)^2\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 = 9^(2n)\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the possible remainders when dividing 2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 by 9. The remainders can only be 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 8, since 2 * (9k)^2 + 2 * (9k) + 1 \u2261 1 (mod 9), 2 * (9k + 1)^2 + 2 * (9k + 1) + 1 \u2261 3 (mod 9), 2 * (9k + 2)^2 + 2 * (9k + 2) + 1 \u2261 4 (mod 9), 2 * (9k + 3)^2 + 2 * (9k + 3) + 1 \u2261 5 (mod 9), 2 * (9k + 4)^2 + 2 * (9k + 4) + 1 \u2261 7 (mod 9), and 2 * (9k + 5)^2 + 2 * (9k + 5) + 1 \u2261 8 (mod 9).\n\nSince 2 * (2^k)^2 + 2 * (2^k) + 1 \u2261 1, 3, or 7 (mod 9), we must have 1 \u2261 9^(2n) (mod 9), which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, there are no positive integer solutions when x is odd, y is even, and m is even.\n\nIn conclusion, the given equation 2^x + 1 = 3^y has no positive integer solutions."}}, "identifier": "P_Number-Theory_70", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "The obvious solutions are @@x=1, y=1@@ and @@x=3, y=2@@.", "_text": "The obvious solutions are x=1, y=1 and x=3, y=2.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "For @@x\u22654@@ and odd @@y@@, we have @@2^x=3^y-1=(3-1)(3^(y-1)+3^(y-2)+...+3+1)@@.", "_text": "For x\u22654 and odd y, we have 2^x=3^y-1=(3-1)(3^(y-1)+3^(y-2)+...+3+1).", "ch_idxs": [0, 1]}, {"_raw_text": "The second term in the product is a sum of odd number of odd values, and not divisible by 2.", "_text": "The second term in the product is a sum of odd number of odd values, and not divisible by 2.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, the product is not divisible by 4, which contradicts with the fact that @@2^x@@ is divisible by 4 for @@x\u22654@@.", "_text": "Thus, the product is not divisible by 4, which contradicts with the fact that 2^x is divisible by 4 for x\u22654.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "So we have no solution here.", "_text": "So we have no solution here.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "For @@x\u22654@@ and even @@y@@, let @@y=2k@@ and we have @@2^x=3^(2k)-1=(3^k)^2-1@@.", "_text": "For x\u22654 and even y, let y=2k and we have 2^x=3^(2k)-1=(3^k)^2-1.", "ch_idxs": [2, 3]}, {"_raw_text": "Since @@3^k@@ is odd, we let @@3^k=2a+1@@, which means @@2^x=(2a+1)^2-1=(2a+2)(2a)=4a(a+1)@@.", "_text": "Since 3^k is odd, we let 3^k=2a+1, which means 2^x=(2a+1)^2-1=(2a+2)(2a)=4a(a+1).", "ch_idxs": [3, 4, 5]}, {"_raw_text": "Since either @@a@@ or @@a+1@@ must be odd, when @@a\u003e1@@, the right hand side contains an odd factor greater than 1, which is not present in @@2^x@@.

Can the expression be 0?\nFor the expression to be 0, we would need 12^m = 5^n. However, since 12 and 5 are co-prime (they share no common factors other than 1), there are no positive integer solutions to this equation. Therefore, the expression cannot be 0.\n\n2. Can the expression equal 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6?\nSince 5 and 12 are co-prime, their powers will also be co-prime. This means that |12^m - 5^n| cannot be 1, because if it were, 12^m and 5^n would differ by 1, implying they share a common factor, which is not possible.\n\nLet\u0027s consider the possibilities for |12^m - 5^n| being 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can quickly check small values of m and n to see if any of these differences occur. However, since 12^m grows much faster than 5^n, we can expect that for large m and n, the difference will be much larger than 6. Therefore, we only need to check small values of m and n.\n\nChecking manually, we find that no small values of m and n give a difference of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. For example, 12^1 - 5^1 = 7, which is already larger than 6.\n\n3. Since 5 and 12 are co-prime, and 12 is not 1, it follows that 12 does not divide any power of 5. Therefore, 12^m - 5^n cannot be 1.\n\n4. If we express 5^n in terms of m, we get 5^n = 12^m - 1. The factors of 5^n are all powers of 5, and since 12^m - 1 is one less than a power of 12, it cannot be a power of 5.\n\n5. We can use the identity x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y) to factor expressions of the form 5^(2n) - 1, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.\n\n6. Considering the equation modulo 3, we note that 12 \u2261 0 (mod 3) and 5 \u2261 2 (mod 3). Therefore, 12^m \u2261 0 (mod 3) for any m, and 5^n \u2261 2^n (mod 3). If n is even, then 2^n \u2261 1 (mod 3), and if n is odd, then 2^n \u2261 2 (mod 3). This means that 5^n - 12^m cannot be 1, because if n is even, 5^n \u2261 1 (mod 3) and 12^m \u2261 0 (mod 3), so 5^n - 12^m \u2261 1 (mod 3). If n is odd, 5^n \u2261 2 (mod 3) and 12^m \u2261 0 (mod 3), so 5^n - 12^m \u2261 2 (mod 3).\n\n7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify calculations, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.\n\n8. For even n, we can factor 5^n - 1 into (5^(n/2) + 1)(5^(n/2) - 1). We can check the divisibility of these factors by 4, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.\n\n9. Recognizing that 12^m = 2^(2m) * 3^m, we can try to split the prime factors among the two factors of 5^n - 1, but this is a complex problem that requires more detailed analysis.\n\n10. We can check whether P and Q can both be divisible by 3 by studying their difference, but this does not directly help us find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.\n\n11. Studying possible solutions of the factor splitting is a complex problem that requires more detailed analysis.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the fact that we have not found a simple solution for small values of m and n, we may need to resort to a more systematic search or advanced number-theoretic techniques to find the smallest value of |12^m - 5^n|.

The possible values of \\(z^2 \\mod 8\\) are the same as those for \\(x^2\\) and \\(y^2\\), which are 0, 1, or 4.\n\nSince the left side of the equation can be 5, 6, or 2 modulo 8, and these values do not match any of the possible values of \\(z^2 \\mod 8\\), we conclude that there are no integer solutions to the equation \\((x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) + 1981 = z^2\\)."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "end_idx": 621, "start_idx": 526, "text": "To solve the equation (x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) + 1981 = z^2 for integer solutions, let\u0027s first expand the left side of the equation:\n\n(x^2 - 1)(y^2 - 1) = x^2y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 1\n\nNow, our equation looks like this:\n\nx^2y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 1 + 1981 = z^2\n\nCombine the constant terms:\n\nx^2y^2 - x^2 - y^2 + 1982 = z^2\n\nNow, let\u0027s rearrange the terms to group the x\u0027s and y\u0027s:\n\nx^2y^2 - x^2 - y^2 = z^2 - 1982\n\nWe can factor -1 from the x and y terms:\n\n-x^2(1 - y^2) - y^2 = z^2 - 1982\n\nNow, let\u0027s look at the right side of the equation. We want to find a z such that z^2 - 1982 is a product of two numbers, one of which is negative. Since 1982 is not a perfect square, z^2 - 1982 will not be a perfect square either. This means that we are looking for two numbers whose product is z^2 - 1982, and one of them must be negative.\n\nLet\u0027s consider the possible factors of z^2 - 1982. Since we are looking for integer solutions, we can try to find factors of 1982 that could work with our equation. The prime factorization of 1982 is:\n\n1982 = 2 * 991\n\nNow, we can consider the possible combinations of factors that could give us z^2 - 1982:\n\n1. (-1)(1982) = -1982\n2. (-2)(991) = -1982\n\nHowever, we need to find a combination where one factor is of the form x^2 and the other is of the form 1 - y^2 or vice versa. Since 1982 is not a perfect square, and neither is 991, we cannot directly match these factors to x^2 or 1 - y^2.\n\nLet\u0027s try to express z^2 - 1982 in terms of x and y:\n\nz^2 - 1982 = (xy)^2 - x^2 - y^2\n\nWe can see that for integer solutions, (xy)^2, x^2, and y^2 must be such that their combination results in a number that is 1982 less than a perfect square. This is a Diophantine equation, and solving it generally requires finding patterns or using modular arithmetic to limit the possibilities.\n\nHowever, we can make an observation that might simplify our search. Notice that x^2 and y^2 are both perfect squares, and for their difference to be 1982, which is even, both x and y must be of the same parity (both even or both odd). If both x and y are odd, then x^2 and y^2 are both congruent to 1 modulo 4, and their difference would be a multiple of 4, which 1982 is not. Therefore, x and y must both be even.\n\nLet\u0027s denote x = 2m and y = 2n, where m and n are integers. Then our equation becomes:\n\n(4m^2 - 1)(4n^2 - 1) = z^2 - 1982\n\nExpanding this, we get:\n\n16m^2n^2 - 4m^2 - 4n^2 + 1 = z^2 - 1982\n\nNow, let\u0027s add 1982 to both sides:\n\n16m^2n^2 - 4m^2 - 4n^2 + 1983 = z^2\n\nWe need to find m, n, and z such that the left side is a perfect square. This is a non-trivial problem, and it may require a more systematic approach or computational assistance to find a solution.\n\nOne approach is to try different values of m and n and check if the left side becomes a perfect square. However, this is not an efficient method and does not guarantee a solution.\n\nAnother approach is to use number theory techniques to analyze the equation further. For example, we can look at the equation modulo different primes to find constraints on m, n, and z. This can help us narrow down the search for possible solutions.\n\nWithout further constraints or insights, finding integer solutions to this equation is a challenging problem that may not have a straightforward solution.

This is because:\n\n1/n - 1/(n+1) = (n+1 - n) / (n(n+1)) = 1/(n(n+1))\n\nNow, let\u0027s look at the series again:\n\np/q = 1/2 + 1/12 + ... + 1/(1317*1318) + 1/1319\n\nWe can see that the denominator of each fraction is the product of two consecutive integers, which means that each term is the difference of the reciprocals of two consecutive integers.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the last term separately:\n\n1/1319\n\nSince 1319 is a prime number, it does not simplify with any other term in the series. We will keep this term separate and focus on the rest of the series.\n\nThe rest of the series can be rewritten as:\n\np/q - 1/1319 = 1/2 + 1/12 + ... + 1/(1317*1318)\n\nNow, let\u0027s find a common denominator for the series (excluding the last term). The common denominator will be the least common multiple (LCM) of all the denominators. However, since the denominators are products of consecutive integers, the LCM is simply the product of all the integers from 2 to 1318.\n\nTherefore, the common denominator is:\n\nq = 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 1318\n\nNow, let\u0027s express the series with this common denominator:\n\np/q - 1/1319 = (q/2 + q/12 + ... + q/(1317*1318)) / q\n\nSince we want to find p mod 1979, we need to find the numerator modulo 1979. However, we have a problem: the common denominator q is a huge number, and we cannot compute it directly. Instead, we will use the fact that we are only interested in the remainder when divided by 1979.\n\nLet\u0027s look at the terms in the series modulo 1979:\n\n1/2 mod 1979\n1/12 mod 1979\n...\n1/(1317*1318) mod 1979\n\nEach of these terms can be simplified by finding the modular inverse of the denominator modulo 1979.

Since 1979 is a prime number, we can find the modular inverse of each even number using Fermat\u0027s Little Theorem, which states that for a prime p and an integer a such that gcd(a, p) = 1, we have:\n\na^(p-1) \u2261 1 (mod p)\n\nTherefore, the modular inverse of a modulo p is:\n\na^(p-2) mod p\n\nLet\u0027s apply this to find the modular inverses of the even numbers modulo 1979:\n\n1/2 mod 1979 = 2^(1979-2) mod 1979\n1/4 mod 1979 = 4^(1979-2) mod 1979\n...\n1/1318 mod 1979 = 1318^(1979-2) mod 1979\n\nNow, we need to sum all these modular inverses modulo 1979.

If we let \\( y = x^2 \\), then our expression becomes \\( y^2 + y + 1 \\). This still doesn\u0027t look like a sum of cubes, but we can add and subtract a term to make it fit the formula.

We can express m as k + i for some integer i where 3 \u2264 i \u2264 k.\n\nUsing property 4, we know that if 3 divides both f(k) and f(k+1), then it will also divide their linear combination. Specifically, for any integer i, we can write:\nf(k+i) = f(k) + i[f(k+1) - f(k)] + i(i-1)/2[f(k+2) - 2f(k+1) + f(k)] + ... (higher-order terms)\n\nSince f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2) are divisible by 3, all the differences [f(k+1) - f(k)], [f(k+2) - 2f(k+1) + f(k)], etc., are also divisible by 3. This is because subtraction of two multiples of 3 is still a multiple of 3.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the term i(i-1)/2. Since i is an integer, the product i(i-1) is always even, so i(i-1)/2 is an integer. Moreover, among any three consecutive integers, there is always one that is a multiple of 3. Therefore, for any three consecutive values of i, at least one of them will make i(i-1)/2 a multiple of 3.\n\nSince m-k, m-k-1, and m-k-2 are three consecutive numbers, for any three consecutive values of m, at least one of them will make f(m) divisible by 3.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many values of m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k} will result in f(m) being divisible by 3.\n\nSince we are looking at the set from k+3 to 2k, we have k-2 integers to consider. We know that for every three consecutive integers, at least one is divisible by 3. Therefore, we can divide the total number of integers (k-2) by 3 to find the minimum number of values for which f(m) is divisible by 3.\n\nThe minimum number of values is \u230a(k-2)/3\u230b, where \u230ax\u230b denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to x.\n\nTherefore, for integer m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, at least \u230a(k-2)/3\u230b of them have f(m) divisible by 3."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "end_idx": 479, "start_idx": 347, "text": "Let\u0027s denote the polynomial f(x) as follows:\n\nf(x) = a_n*x^n + a_{n-1}*x^{n-1} + ... + a_1*x + a_0\n\nwhere a_n, a_{n-1}, ..., a_1, a_0 are integer coefficients.\n\nWe are given that f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2) are all divisible by 3.

Since f(k), f(k+1), and f(k+2) are divisible by 3, we can say that the polynomial f(x) - f(k) has k, k+1, and k+2 as roots modulo 3. This means that (x-k)(x-(k+1))(x-(k+2)) is a factor of f(x) - f(k) modulo 3.\n\nLet\u0027s denote g(x) = f(x) - f(k).

For each m in this set, we have:\n\ng(m) \u2261 (m-k)(m-(k+1))(m-(k+2)) * h(m) (mod 3)\n\nSince m is in the range from k+3 to 2k, the factors (m-k), (m-(k+1)), and (m-(k+2)) are all positive integers. Moreover, since m is at most 2k, these factors are at most k, k-1, and k-2, respectively.\n\nNow, in the range from 1 to k, there must be at least one multiple of 3, because every third number is a multiple of 3. Therefore, for at least one value of m in the set {k+3, k+4, ..., 2k}, one of the factors (m-k), (m-(k+1)), or (m-(k+2)) will be a multiple of 3, making g(m) divisible by 3.\n\nHowever, we want to find the minimum number of m\u0027s for which f(m) is divisible by 3.

However, we can use numerical methods or approximations to find the solutions.\n\nUsing numerical methods, we find that the solutions to the cubic equation y^3 - 2y + 1 = 0 are approximately y \u2248 -0.7549, y \u2248 0.2679, and y \u2248 1.487.\n\nNow, we substitute back y = x^2 into these solutions to find the corresponding values of x:\n\nFor y \u2248 -0.7549, we have x^2 \u2248 -0.7549. Since the square of a real number cannot be negative, there are no real solutions for this case.\n\nFor y \u2248 0.2679, we have x^2 \u2248 0.2679. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x \u2248 \u00b10.5178.\n\nFor y \u2248 1.487, we have x^2 \u2248 1.487. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x \u2248 \u00b11.219.\n\nTherefore, the real-valued solutions to the equation x^8 + 4x^6 - 10x^4 + 4x^2 + 1 = 0 are approximately x \u2248 -1.219, x \u2248 -0.5178, x \u2248 0.5178, and x \u2248 1.219."}}, "identifier": "P_Polynomial_22", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "Let @@f(x)=x^8+4x^6\u221210x^4+4x^2+1@@.", "_text": "Let f(x)=x^8+4x^6\u221210x^4+4x^2+1.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "We have @@f(x)=x^4*g(z)@@ where @@z=x+1/x@@ and @@g(z)=x^4+4x^2-10+4/x^2+1/x^4@@ should be a polynomial of degree 4 in @@z@@.", "_text": "We have f(x)=x^4*g(z) where z=x+1/x and g(z)=x^4+4x^2-10+4/x^2+1/x^4 should be a polynomial of degree 4 in z.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "We have @@z^4=(x+1/x)^4=x^4+4x^2+6+4/x^2+1/x^4@@, so @@g(z)=z^4-16@@.", "_text": "We have z^4=(x+1/x)^4=x^4+4x^2+6+4/x^2+1/x^4, so g(z)=z^4-16.", "ch_idxs": [1, 2]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, we have @@f(x)=x^4*(z^4-16)@@, and since @@x\u22600@@, we must have @@z^4=16@@.", "_text": "Thus, we have f(x)=x^4*(z^4-16), and since x\u22600, we must have z^4=16.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "This gives us @@z^2=\u00b14@@, and @@z=\u00b12, \u00b12i@@.", "_text": "This gives us z^2=\u00b14, and z=\u00b12, \u00b12i.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "With @@z=x+1/x@@, we do not have real-valued @@x@@ for @@z=\u00b12i@@.", "_text": "With z=x+1/x, we do not have real-valued x for z=\u00b12i.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "When @@z=2@@, we have @@x=1@@.", "_text": "When z=2, we have x=1.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "When @@z=-2@@, we have @@x=-1@@.", "_text": "When z=-2, we have x=-1.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "So the real-valued solutions to the equation are @@x=\u00b11@@.", "_text": "So the real-valued solutions to the equation are x=\u00b11.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Polynomial_23": {"_answer": "7", "_raw_answer": "7", "_raw_text": "Finding the remainder when @@p(x^7)@@ is divided by @@p(x)@@, where @@p(x)=x^6+x^5+...+x+1@@?", "_text": "Finding the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x), where p(x)=x^6+x^5+...+x+1?", "category": "Polynomial", "ch_list": ["C_geom_series", "H_Polynomial_23_1", "C_poly_div_poly", "C_div", "C_mod_transitivity"], "fws_annotations": {"Problem + CH": {"author": "gpt-3.5-turbo-16k", "end_idx": 345, "start_idx": 299, "text": "To find the remainder when p(x^7) is divided by p(x), we can use the Remainder Theorem.

We can substitute these values into the polynomial to see if they are indeed roots.\n\nSubstituting x = 1, we get:\n\n1^9 + 1^4 - 1 - 1 = 1 + 1 - 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, x = 1 is a root of the polynomial.\n\nSubstituting x = -1, we get:\n\n(-1)^9 + (-1)^4 - (-1) - 1 = -1 + 1 + 1 - 1 = 0\n\nSo, x = -1 is also a root of the polynomial.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial can be factored as:\n\n(x - 1)(x + 1)(x^7 - x^6 + x^5 - x^4 + x^3 - x^2 + x - 1)\n\nThe third factor is a 7th degree polynomial, which is not easy to factor further, especially without a specific technique or further information.

If a polynomial f(x) has an integer zero a, then (x - a) is a factor of f(x).\n\n3.

Suppose f(x) has k integer zeros. Then we can write f(x) as:\n\nf(x) = (x - x_1)(x - x_2)...(x - x_k)g(x)\n\nwhere x_1, x_2, ..., x_k are the integer zeros and g(x) is a polynomial of degree n - k.\n\nIf we evaluate f(0), we get:\n\nf(0) = (-x_1)(-x_2)...(-x_k)g(0)\n\nSince f(0) is odd, the product (-x_1)(-x_2)...(-x_k)g(0) must also be odd.

We cannot have a situation where all the x_i are odd integers because it would make f(1) even, not odd.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to have no integer zeros at all.

If f(k) = 0, then k is a root of the polynomial.\n\nLet\u0027s look at the polynomial in its general form:\n\nf(x) = a_n*x^n + a_(n-1)*x^(n-1) + ... + a_2*x^2 + a_1*x + a_0\n\nwhere a_n, a_(n-1), ..., a_1, a_0 are integer coefficients and a_0 is odd (since f(0) is odd).\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider the polynomial evaluated at x = 2. Since all the coefficients are integers, f(2) will be even because:\n\n- a_0 is odd (given),\n- a_1*2 is even (since it\u0027s an integer times 2),\n- a_2*2^2 is even (since it\u0027s an integer times 4),\n- ...\n- a_n*2^n is even (since it\u0027s an integer times 2 raised to a power greater than or equal to 2).\n\nSo, f(2) is the sum of one odd number (a_0) and several even numbers, which results in an odd number. Therefore, f(2) cannot be zero, and 2 is not a root of the polynomial.\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider any even integer k. The same reasoning applies: f(k) will be the sum of an odd number (a_0) and several even numbers (since k^n, k^(n-1), ..., k are all even when k is even). Thus, f(k) will be odd for any even integer k, and no even integer can be a root of the polynomial.\n\nSince no even integer can be a root, all integer-valued roots must be odd. Now, let\u0027s consider two distinct odd integer roots, say p and q. Since p and q are both odd, (p - q) is even. By the Factor Theorem, (x - p) and (x - q) are factors of f(x). The product (x - p)(x - q) expands to:\n\nx^2 - (p + q)x + pq\n\nSince p and q are odd, (p + q) is even, and pq is odd. This means that the coefficient of x in the product is even, and the constant term is odd.\n\nNow, if we had another pair of odd integer roots, say r and s, the same reasoning would apply, and we would again get an even coefficient for the x term and an odd constant term when multiplying (x - r)(x - s).\n\nHowever, we know that the sum of all coefficients of f(x) is odd (since f(1) is odd). If we keep multiplying pairs of factors corresponding to odd roots, we will keep getting even coefficients for the x terms, which will add up to an even number, contradicting the fact that the sum of all coefficients is odd.\n\nTherefore, the polynomial f(x) can have at most one pair of odd integer roots. This means that the maximum number of integer-valued zeros that f(x) can have is 2.\n\nIn conclusion, a polynomial f(x) of degree n with integer coefficients, where both f(0) and f(1) are odd, can have at most two integer-valued zeros."}}, "identifier": "P_Polynomial_3", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "Suppose that there is an integer-valued zero at @@x=a@@.", "_text": "Suppose that there is an integer-valued zero at x=a.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "Then @@f(x)=(x-a)g(x)@@ for some polynomial @@g(x)@@ of degree @@n-1@@.", "_text": "Then f(x)=(x-a)g(x) for some polynomial g(x) of degree n-1.", "ch_idxs": [1]}, {"_raw_text": "Let @@g(x)=c_(n-1)*x^(n-1)+c_(n-2)*x^(n-2)+...+c_1*x+c_0@@.", "_text": "Let g(x)=c_(n-1)*x^(n-1)+c_(n-2)*x^(n-2)+...+c_1*x+c_0.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "So @@f(x)=c_(n-1)*x^n+(c_(n-2)-a*c_(n-1))*x^(n-1)+(c_(n-3)-a*c_(n-2))*x^(n-2)+...+(c_0-a*c_1)*x-a*c_0@@.", "_text": "So f(x)=c_(n-1)*x^n+(c_(n-2)-a*c_(n-1))*x^(n-1)+(c_(n-3)-a*c_(n-2))*x^(n-2)+...+(c_0-a*c_1)*x-a*c_0.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "We need every coefficient of @@f(x)@@ to be an integer, which means that @@c_(n-1)@@ is an integer, thus @@c_(n-2)@@ is an integer, thus @@c_(n-3)@@ is an integer, and so on for all @@c_i@@.", "_text": "We need every coefficient of f(x) to be an integer, which means that c_(n-1) is an integer, thus c_(n-2) is an integer, thus c_(n-3) is an integer, and so on for all c_i.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "So @@g(x)@@ is a polynomial of integer coefficients.", "_text": "So g(x) is a polynomial of integer coefficients.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, we have @@f(0)=-a*g(x)@@ and @@f(1)=(1-a)*g(x)@@.", "_text": "Thus, we have f(0)=-a*g(x) and f(1)=(1-a)*g(x).", "ch_idxs": [2]}, {"_raw_text": "Since @@-a@@ and @@1-a@@ are of opposite parities (i.e., one even and one odd), we cannot have @@f(0)@@ and @@f(1)@@ both being odd.", "_text": "Since -a and 1-a are of opposite parities (i.e., one even and one odd), we cannot have f(0) and f(1) both being odd.", "ch_idxs": [2]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, such an integer root @@a@@ does not exist.", "_text": "Thus, such an integer root a does not exist.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Polynomial_30": {"_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_text": "What are possible values of @@n mod k@@ if @@x^n-y^n@@ is divisible by @@x^k-y^k@@ for integer @@n, k@@?", "_text": "What are possible values of n mod k if x^n-y^n is divisible by x^k-y^k for integer n, k?", "category": "Polynomial", "ch_list": ["H_Polynomial_30_1", "H_Polynomial_30_2", "C_poly_div_poly", "C_div"], "fws_annotations": {"Problem + CH": {"author": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "end_idx": null, "start_idx": null, "text": "To solve this problem, we will use the given information and the properties of divisibility.\n\nGiven that \\( x^n - y^n \\) is divisible by \\( x^k - y^k \\), we want to find possible values of \\( n \\mod k \\).\n\nLet\u0027s start by expressing \\( n \\) in terms of \\( k \\) using the division algorithm:\n\n1. \\( n = kq + r \\), where \\( 0 \\leq r \u003c k \\).\n\nNow, we rewrite \\( x^n - y^n \\) by adding and subtracting \\( y^{kq}x^r \\):\n\n2. \\( x^n - y^n = x^{kq+r} - y^{kq+r} = (x^{kq}x^r - y^{kq}x^r) + (y^{kq}x^r - y^{kq}y^r) \\)\n\nSimplify the expression by factoring:\n\n\\( x^n - y^n = x^r(x^{kq} - y^{kq}) + y^{kq}(x^r - y^r) \\)\n\nWe know that \\( x^{kq} - y^{kq} \\) is a multiple of \\( x^k - y^k \\) because \\( x^{kq} - y^{kq} \\) can be factored into a product of terms each of which is \\( x^k - y^k \\) times a polynomial in \\( x^k \\) and \\( y^k \\).

By factoring f(x) using complex numbers, we can find the roots:\n\n(x - \u03c9)(x - \u03c9^2)(x - \u03c9^3)(x - \u03c9^4) = 0\n\nwhere \u03c9 is a complex cube root of unity, given by \u03c9 = e^(2\u03c0i/3).\n\nExpanding the above equation, we get:\n\n(x^2 - (\u03c9 + \u03c9^2)x + \u03c9\u03c9^2)(x^2 - (\u03c9^3 + \u03c9^4)x + \u03c9^3\u03c9^4) = 0\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\n(x^2 - (\u03c9 + \u03c9^2)x + 1)(x^2 - (\u03c9^3 + \u03c9^4)x + 1) = 0\n\nNow, we can evaluate f(x^5) at the roots of f(x):\n\nf(x^5) = (x^5)^4 + (x^5)^3 + (x^5)^2 + (x^5) + 1\n\n= x^20 + x^15 + x^10 + x^5 + 1\n\nEvaluating f(x^5) at the roots of f(x), we get:\n\nf(\u03c9) = \u03c9^20 + \u03c9^15 + \u03c9^10 + \u03c9^5 + 1\n\nf(\u03c9^2) = (\u03c9^2)^20 + (\u03c9^2)^15 + (\u03c9^2)^10 + (\u03c9^2)^5 + 1\n\nf(\u03c9^3) = (\u03c9^3)^20 + (\u03c9^3)^15 + (\u03c9^3)^10 + (\u03c9^3)^5 + 1\n\nf(\u03c9^4) = (\u03c9^4)^20 + (\u03c9^4)^15 + (\u03c9^4)^10 + (\u03c9^4)^5 + 1\n\nNow, we can find the remainder by evaluating f(x^5) at each root and summing them up:\n\nRemainder = f(\u03c9) + f(\u03c9^2) + f(\u03c9^3) + f(\u03c9^4)\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nf(\u03c9) = \u03c9^20 + \u03c9^15 + \u03c9^10 + \u03c9^5 + 1\n\nSince \u03c9^3 = 1, we can simplify this to:\n\nf(\u03c9) = \u03c9^2 + \u03c9 + 1 + \u03c9^2 + 1\n\n= 2\u03c9^2 + \u03c9 + 2\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the other terms:\n\nf(\u03c9^2) = 2\u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + 2\n\nf(\u03c9^3) = 2\u03c9^2 + \u03c9 + 2\n\nf(\u03c9^4) = 2\u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + 2\n\nNow, we can find the remainder:\n\nRemainder = f(\u03c9) + f(\u03c9^2) + f(\u03c9^3) + f(\u03c9^4)\n\n= (2\u03c9^2 + \u03c9 + 2) + (2\u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + 2) + (2\u03c9^2 + \u03c9 + 2) + (2\u03c9 + \u03c9^2 + 2)\n\n= 6\u03c9^2 + 6\u03c9 + 8\n\nTherefore, the remainder of f(x^5) divided by f(x) is 6\u03c9^2 + 6\u03c9 + 8."}}, "identifier": "P_Polynomial_32", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "We have @@f(x^5)=x^20+x^15+x^10+x^5+1=(x^20-1)+(x^15-1)+(x^10-1)+(x^5-1)+5@@.", "_text": "We have f(x^5)=x^20+x^15+x^10+x^5+1=(x^20-1)+(x^15-1)+(x^10-1)+(x^5-1)+5.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "We have @@x^20-1@@, @@x^15-1@@, @@x^10-1@@, @@x^5-1@@ all divisible by @@x^5-1@@.", "_text": "We have x^20-1, x^15-1, x^10-1, x^5-1 all divisible by x^5-1.", "ch_idxs": [1]}, {"_raw_text": "We also have @@f(x) | x^5-1@@ because @@(x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)=x^5-1@@.", "_text": "We also have f(x) | x^5-1 because (x-1)(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)=x^5-1.", "ch_idxs": [2]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, @@(x^20-1)+(x^15-1)+(x^10-1)+(x^5-1)@@ is divisible by @@f(x)@@.", "_text": "Thus, (x^20-1)+(x^15-1)+(x^10-1)+(x^5-1) is divisible by f(x).", "ch_idxs": [3, 4]}, {"_raw_text": "So the remainder of @@f(x^5)@@ divided by @@f(x)@@ is 5.", "_text": "So the remainder of f(x^5) divided by f(x) is 5.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Polynomial_33": {"_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_answer": "0 is the only possible value", "_raw_text": "The polynomial @@p(x)=ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e@@ with integer coefficients is divisible by 7 for every integer @@x@@.

The roots of $2x^2 + 7x - 1 = 0$ are $x = -\\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{53}}{4}$, and the roots of $2x^2 - 7x - 17 = 0$ are $x = \\frac{7}{4} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{103}}{4}$.\n\nTherefore, the real-valued solutions to the equation $4x^{11} + 4x^{10} - 21x^9 - 21x^8 + 17x^7 + 17x^6 + 17x^5 + 17x^4 - 21x^3 - 21x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0$ are $x = -1$, $x = -\\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{53}}{4}$, $x = -\\frac{7}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{53}}{4}$, $x = \\frac{7}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{103}}{4}$, and $x = \\frac{7}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{103}}{4}$."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "chat-bison-001", "end_idx": 170, "start_idx": 0, "text": "We can factor the equation as follows:\n\n$$4x^11+4x^10-21x^9-21x^8+17x^7+17x^6+17x^5+17x^4-21x^3-21x^2+4x+4=(2x-1)(2x-2)(2x-3)(2x-4)(2x-5)(2x-6)(2x-7)(2x-8)(2x-9)(2x-10)$$\n\nTherefore, the only real-valued solutions to the equation are $x=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,$ or $10$.\n\nWe can also solve the equation using the Rational Roots Theorem.

This suggests that the string is not periodic because each iteration adds a new segment that has not appeared before, making the string longer and more complex.\n\nTo prove this, let\u0027s assume that the string does become periodic with some period \\( p \\) after some iteration \\( n \\). This would mean that for all \\( k \\geq n \\), \\( w_k \\) is the same as \\( w_{k+p} \\).

This means that the length of the string is growing in a non-linear fashion, which is inconsistent with periodic behavior.\n\nTherefore, the operation does not result in a periodic binary string in the infinite limit.

It is a fixed point of the function f(x) = sqrt(2)^x, and it can be approximated numerically. \n\nIn conclusion, the sequence does have a limit because it is monotonically increasing and bounded above, but finding the exact value of the limit L requires numerical methods or iteration."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "gpt-4-1106-preview", "end_idx": 1493, "start_idx": 1378, "text": "To determine if the limit of the sequence exists, we need to investigate the behavior of the sequence as \\( n \\) approaches infinity.\n\nGiven the sequence:\n\\( a_1 = \\sqrt{2} \\)\n\\( a_{n+1} = (\\sqrt{2})^{a_n} \\)\n\nLet\u0027s assume the sequence converges to a limit \\( L \\). If the limit exists, then as \\( n \\) goes to infinity, \\( a_n \\) approaches \\( L \\), and \\( a_{n+1} \\) also approaches \\( L \\).

Since \\( \\sqrt{2} = 2^{1/2} \\), we can use the change of base formula:\n\n\\( \\log_{\\sqrt{2}}(L) = \\frac{\\log_2(L)}{\\log_2(\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{\\log_2(L)}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2\\log_2(L) \\)\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation gives us:\n\n\\( 2\\log_2(L) = L \\)\n\nNow, let\u0027s solve for \\( L \\).

We will first find a recursive formula for b_n and then use it to find a_n.\n\nFor b_n, we have two cases for the position of the number n in the permutation:\n1. n is in its natural position, i.e., p(n) = n. In this case, the rest of the permutation is a permutation of {1, ..., n-1} with the same condition, which means there are b_(n-1) such permutations.\n2. n is not in its natural position, which means it must be in position n-1, and n-1 must be in position n (since |p(i)\u2212i|\u22641). In this case, the rest of the permutation is a permutation of {1, ..., n-2} with the same condition, which means there are b_(n-2) such permutations.\n\nTherefore, we have the recursive formula:\nb_n = b_(n-1) + b_(n-2)\n\nWe also know that b_1 = 1 (since there\u0027s only one permutation of a single element) and b_2 = 2 (since both permutations [1, 2] and [2, 1] satisfy the condition).\n\nNow let\u0027s calculate the first few values of b_n:\nb_1 = 1\nb_2 = 2\nb_3 = b_2 + b_1 = 2 + 1 = 3\nb_4 = b_3 + b_2 = 3 + 2 = 5\nb_5 = b_4 + b_3 = 5 + 3 = 8\nb_6 = b_5 + b_4 = 8 + 5 = 13\nb_7 = b_6 + b_5 = 13 + 8 = 21\nb_8 = b_7 + b_6 = 21 + 13 = 34\nb_9 = b_8 + b_7 = 34 + 21 = 55\nb_10 = b_9 + b_8 = 55 + 34 = 89\n\nNow, let\u0027s consider a_n, which allows for wrap-around.

This is because the minimum of the two values will be less than or equal to 1 only if the element is at most one position away from its original position.\n\nLet\u0027s denote the number of such permutations for a set of size n as a_n. We can try to find a pattern or a recursive relationship by looking at smaller cases.\n\nFor n = 1, there is only one permutation: {1}. So a_1 = 1.\n\nFor n = 2, there are two permutations that satisfy the condition: {1, 2} and {2, 1}. So a_2 = 2.\n\nFor n = 3, we have to consider the possible positions for the number 3:\n- It can be in its original position, and the remaining two numbers can be arranged in a_2 ways.\n- It can be in the second position, swapping with the number 2, and the number 1 must be in the first position to satisfy the condition.

We want to show that a_(n+1) \u003c a + 1.\n\na_(n+1) = \u221a(a + a_n) \u003c \u221a(a + (a + 1)) = \u221a(2a + 1) \u003c \u221a(2a + 2) \u003c \u221a(2(a + 1)) = \u221a2 * \u221a(a + 1) \u003c \u221a2 * (a + 1) = (a + 1)\u221a2 \u003c (a + 1)(a + 1) = (a + 1)^2.\n\nTherefore, a_(n+1) \u003c (a + 1)^2, which implies that a_n \u003c a + 1 for all n.\n\nSince the sequence is increasing and bounded above, it must converge to a limit L.\n\nTo find the limit L, we can take the limit as n approaches infinity of both sides of the recursive equation:\n\nL = \u221a(a + L).\n\nSquaring both sides, we get:\n\nL^2 = a + L.\n\nRearranging the equation, we have:\n\nL^2 - L - a = 0.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula:\n\nL = (-(-1) \u00b1 \u221a((-1)^2 - 4(1)(-a))) / (2(1))\n  = (1 \u00b1 \u221a(1 + 4a)) / 2.\n\nSince a \u003e 0, the discriminant (1 + 4a) is positive, so we can take the positive square root:\n\nL = (1 + \u221a(1 + 4a)) / 2.\n\nTherefore, the limit of the sequence defined by a_0 = \u221aa and a_(n+1) = \u221a(a + a_n) exists and is given by (1 + \u221a(1 + 4a)) / 2."}}, "identifier": "P_Sequence_41", "solution": {"steps": [{"_raw_text": "We have @@a_1=sqrt(a+a_0)\u003esqrt(a)=a_0@@.", "_text": "We have a_1=sqrt(a+a_0)\u003esqrt(a)=a_0.", "ch_idxs": [0, 1]}, {"_raw_text": "If @@a_n\u003ea_(n-1)@@, then @@a_(n+1)=sqrt(a+a_n)\u003esqrt(a+a_(n-1))\u003ea_n@@.", "_text": "If a_n\u003ea_(n-1), then a_(n+1)=sqrt(a+a_n)\u003esqrt(a+a_(n-1))\u003ea_n.", "ch_idxs": [0, 1]}, {"_raw_text": "So the sequence is monotonically increasing.", "_text": "So the sequence is monotonically increasing.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "In addition, we have @@a_(n+1)^2=a+a_n@@, which means that @@a_(n+1)^2-a_n-a=0@@.", "_text": "In addition, we have a_(n+1)^2=a+a_n, which means that a_(n+1)^2-a_n-a=0.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "Since @@a_n\u003ca_(n+1)@@ and both are positive, we have @@a_n^2-a_n-a\u003c0@@.", "_text": "Since a_n\u003ca_(n+1) and both are positive, we have a_n^2-a_n-a\u003c0.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "The root of @@a_n^2-a_n-a@@ is @@(1\u00b1sqrt(4a+1))/2@@, so we have @@a_n^2-a_n-a=(a_n-(1+sqrt(4a+1))/2)(a_n-(1-sqrt(4a+1))/2)\u003c0@@, or @@(a_n-(sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2)(a_n+(sqrt(4a+1)-1)/2)\u003c0@@.", "_text": "The root of a_n^2-a_n-a is (1\u00b1sqrt(4a+1))/2, so we have a_n^2-a_n-a=(a_n-(1+sqrt(4a+1))/2)(a_n-(1-sqrt(4a+1))/2)\u003c0, or (a_n-(sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2)(a_n+(sqrt(4a+1)-1)/2)\u003c0.", "ch_idxs": [0, 2]}, {"_raw_text": "Since @@(sqrt(4a+1)-1)/2\u003e0@@ for every @@a\u003e0@@, we must have @@a_n-(sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2\u003c0@@, which means that @@a_n@@ is bounded by @@(sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2@@.", "_text": "Since (sqrt(4a+1)-1)/2\u003e0 for every a\u003e0, we must have a_n-(sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2\u003c0, which means that a_n is bounded by (sqrt(4a+1)+1)/2.", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "Thus, the sequence has a limit, which can be found by solving for @@x=sqrt(a+x)@@.", "_text": "Thus, the sequence has a limit, which can be found by solving for x=sqrt(a+x).", "ch_idxs": [0]}, {"_raw_text": "As mentioned above, the equation has solutions @@(1\u00b1sqrt(4a+1))/2@@, and we take the positive one.", "_text": "As mentioned above, the equation has solutions (1\u00b1sqrt(4a+1))/2, and we take the positive one.", "ch_idxs": []}, {"_raw_text": "So the limit is @@(1+sqrt(4a+1))/2@@.", "_text": "So the limit is (1+sqrt(4a+1))/2.", "ch_idxs": []}]}}, "P_Sequence_42": {"_answer": "601", "_raw_answer": "601", "_raw_text": "1324 persons are arranged in a circle and numbered from 1 to 1324.

This is because in a geometric progression, each term is a multiple of the previous term. However, prime numbers only have two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself. Therefore, it\u0027s impossible for three prime numbers to be in the same geometric progression.\n\n2. Now, let\u0027s consider the prime numbers within [1, 100]. There are 25 prime numbers in this range. Since each prime number must be in its own geometric progression (as we established in step 1), we already have 25 of our geometric progressions.\n\n3. The remaining numbers to be distributed into geometric progressions are the composite numbers and 1. There are 74 composite numbers and 1 within [1, 100]. \n\n4. The number 1 can be in a geometric progression with any number, so we can pair it with any of the composite numbers. Let\u0027s pair it with the smallest composite number, 4. This gives us another geometric progression.\n\n5. Now we have 73 composite numbers left. Each of these can be paired with its multiples to form a geometric progression. For example, the number 6 can be paired with 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, and 96 to form a geometric progression. \n\n6. Following this pattern, we can pair each remaining composite number with its multiples to form a geometric progression. This gives us 73 more geometric progressions.\n\n7.

However, we need to find the number of ways to select 12 geometric progressions. Since we have more than 12 geometric progressions, the number of ways to select 12 from 99 is given by the combination formula C(n, r) = n! / [r!(n-r)!], where n is the total number of items, r is the number of items to choose, and \"!\" denotes factorial.\n\n9.

The final answer is the number of ways to select 12 geometric progressions from the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100 such that every number is in exactly one progression.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified explanation and the actual calculation of the number of ways to select 12 geometric progressions is a complex combinatorial problem."}, "Problem Only": {"author": "gpt-4", "end_idx": 700, "start_idx": 588, "text": "This problem is quite complex and requires a deep understanding of combinatorics and geometric progressions. \n\nFirst, let\u0027s understand what a geometric progression is. A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the ratio. For example, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 is a geometric progression with a ratio of 2.\n\nIn this problem, we are asked to find the number of ways to select 12 geometric progressions from the numbers 1 to 100 such that every number is in exactly one progression. \n\nThe key to solving this problem is to realize that the ratio of each geometric progression must be a power of 2. This is because the largest number is 100 and we need to fit 12 progressions within this range. The largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 100 is 2^6 = 64. \n\nSo, we can have progressions with ratios of 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^6.

For odd n, let n+1 = 2k and factorize the expression for a_n.\n\nNow, let\u0027s look at the terms of the sequence:\n\na_1 = 10001 = 73 * 137, which is not prime.\n\nFor a_2, we have an even n (n=2), so we can use the information from point 2. Let n+1 = m, so m = 3. We can write a_2 as a sum of a geometric series with a = 1 and r = 1000 (since there are three zeros between each pair of ones):\n\na_2 = 1 + 1000 + 1000^2 = 1(1 - 1000^3) / (1 - 1000) using the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series.\n\nWe can simplify this to:\n\na_2 = (1 - 1000^3) / (-999)\na_2 = (1000^3 - 1) / 999\na_2 = (10^9 - 1) / 999\n\nNow, we can use the difference of squares from point 4:\n\n10^9 - 1 = (10^4.5)^2 - 1^2 = (10^4.5 + 1)(10^4.5 - 1)\n\nSince 10^4.5 is not an integer, we can\u0027t directly apply the difference of squares, but we can see that 10^9 - 1 is divisible by 10 - 1, which is 9. So, a_2 is divisible by 9 and thus not prime.\n\nFor a_3, we have an odd n (n=3), so we can use the information from point 7. Let n+1 = 2k, so k = 2. We can write a_3 as a sum of a geometric series with a = 1 and r = 1000:\n\na_3 = 1 + 1000 + 1000^2 + 1000^3\n\nUsing the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, we get:\n\na_3 = 1(1 - 1000^4) / (1 - 1000)\na_3 = (1 - 1000^4) / (-999)\na_3 = (1000^4 - 1) / 999\n\nNow, we can use the difference of squares:\n\n1000^4 - 1 = (10^6)^2 - 1^2 = (10^6 + 1)(10^6 - 1)\n\nWe can see that 10^6 - 1 is divisible by 10 - 1, which is 9, and 10^6 + 1 is divisible by 10 + 1, which is 11. So, a_3 is divisible by both 9 and 11, and thus not prime.\n\nContinuing this pattern, we can see that for each term a_n in the sequence, if n is even, a_n will be divisible by 9, and if n is odd, a_n will be divisible by both 9 and 11.

The lamps are labeled modulo $n$, that is, $L_{-1} = L_{n-1}$, $L_0 = L_n$, $L_1 = L_{n+1}$. Initially all lamps are ON. For $n \\in \\\\{2, 3, \\ldots, 100\\\\}$, how many of them result in a the sequence of switching not being able to return all lamps to the ON state ever again?\n\nWe can consider a sequence $(x_0, x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{n-1}) = (1, 1, 1, \\ldots, 1)$ representing the initial state of the lamps, and each $S_j$ appending the new state of the lamp being affected to the sequence. We can then find a formula for $x_{j+1}$ given $x_0, \\ldots, x_j$ as follows:\n\n$$x_{j+1} = \\begin{cases} 1 - x_{j-1} \u0026 \\text{if } x_{j-1} = 1 \\\\\\ x_{j-1} \u0026 \\text{if } x_{j-1} = 0 \\end{cases}$$\n\nLet $v_j = [x_j, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_{j+n-1}]$ be a binary vector. We can then study any possible repetitions in the sequence of vectors $v_0, v_1, v_2, \\ldots$.\n\nIf there is a repetition in the sequence of vectors $v_0, v_1, v_2, \\ldots$, then there must be a $j$ such that $v_j = v_{j+k}$ for some $k \u003e 0$. In this case, we can define a sequence of steps $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots$ such that $S_j$ changes the state of $L_j$ from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON, and $S_{j+k}$ leaves the state of $L_j$ unchanged. This means that the sequence of steps $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots$ cannot return all lamps to the ON state ever again.\n\nConversely, if there is no repetition in the sequence of vectors $v_0, v_1, v_2, \\ldots$, then there is no sequence of steps $S_0, S_1, S_2, \\ldots$ such that $S_j$ changes the state of $L_j$ from ON to OFF or from OFF to ON, and $S_{j+k}$ leaves the state of $L_j$ unchanged.
